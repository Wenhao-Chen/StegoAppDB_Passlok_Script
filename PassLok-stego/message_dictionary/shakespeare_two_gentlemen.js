		"Two Gentlemen of Verona\n"+
		"ACT I\n"+
		"SCENE I. Verona. An open place.\n"+
		"Enter VALENTINE and PROTEUS\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus:\n"+
		"Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits.\n"+
		"Were't not affection chains thy tender days\n"+
		"To the sweet glances of thy honour'd love,\n"+
		"I rather would entreat thy company\n"+
		"To see the wonders of the world abroad,\n"+
		"Than, living dully sluggardized at home,\n"+
		"Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness.\n"+
		"But since thou lovest, love still and thrive therein,\n"+
		"Even as I would when I to love begin.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu!\n"+
		"Think on thy Proteus, when thou haply seest\n"+
		"Some rare note-worthy object in thy travel:\n"+
		"Wish me partaker in thy happiness\n"+
		"When thou dost meet good hap; and in thy danger,\n"+
		"If ever danger do environ thee,\n"+
		"Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers,\n"+
		"For I will be thy beadsman, Valentine.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"And on a love-book pray for my success?\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Upon some book I love I'll pray for thee.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"That's on some shallow story of deep love:\n"+
		"How young Leander cross'd the Hellespont.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"That's a deep story of a deeper love:\n"+
		"For he was more than over shoes in love.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"'Tis true; for you are over boots in love,\n"+
		"And yet you never swum the Hellespont.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Over the boots? nay, give me not the boots.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"No, I will not, for it boots thee not.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"What?\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans;\n"+
		"Coy looks with heart-sore sighs; one fading moment's mirth\n"+
		"With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights:\n"+
		"If haply won, perhaps a hapless gain;\n"+
		"If lost, why then a grievous labour won;\n"+
		"However, but a folly bought with wit,\n"+
		"Or else a wit by folly vanquished.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"So, by your circumstance, I fear you'll prove.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"'Tis love you cavil at: I am not Love.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Love is your master, for he masters you:\n"+
		"And he that is so yoked by a fool,\n"+
		"Methinks, should not be chronicled for wise.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Yet writers say, as in the sweetest bud\n"+
		"The eating canker dwells, so eating love\n"+
		"Inhabits in the finest wits of all.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"And writers say, as the most forward bud\n"+
		"Is eaten by the canker ere it blow,\n"+
		"Even so by love the young and tender wit\n"+
		"Is turn'd to folly, blasting in the bud,\n"+
		"Losing his verdure even in the prime\n"+
		"And all the fair effects of future hopes.\n"+
		"But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee,\n"+
		"That art a votary to fond desire?\n"+
		"Once more adieu! my father at the road\n"+
		"Expects my coming, there to see me shipp'd.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"And thither will I bring thee, Valentine.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Sweet Proteus, no; now let us take our leave.\n"+
		"To Milan let me hear from thee by letters\n"+
		"Of thy success in love, and what news else\n"+
		"Betideth here in absence of thy friend;\n"+
		"And likewise will visit thee with mine.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"All happiness bechance to thee in Milan!\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"As much to you at home! and so, farewell.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"He after honour hunts, I after love:\n"+
		"He leaves his friends to dignify them more,\n"+
		"I leave myself, my friends and all, for love.\n"+
		"Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphosed me,\n"+
		"Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,\n"+
		"War with good counsel, set the world at nought;\n"+
		"Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.\n"+
		"Enter SPEED\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"Sir Proteus, save you! Saw you my master?\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"But now he parted hence, to embark for Milan.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"Twenty to one then he is shipp'd already,\n"+
		"And I have play'd the sheep in losing him.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Indeed, a sheep doth very often stray,\n"+
		"An if the shepherd be a while away.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"You conclude that my master is a shepherd, then,\n"+
		"and I a sheep?\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"I do.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"Why then, my horns are his horns, whether I wake or sleep.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"A silly answer and fitting well a sheep.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"This proves me still a sheep.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"True; and thy master a shepherd.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"It shall go hard but I'll prove it by another.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"The shepherd seeks the sheep, and not the sheep the\n"+
		"shepherd; but I seek my master, and my master seeks\n"+
		"not me: therefore I am no sheep.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd; the\n"+
		"shepherd for food follows not the sheep: thou for\n"+
		"wages followest thy master; thy master for wages\n"+
		"follows not thee: therefore thou art a sheep.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"Such another proof will make me cry 'baa.'\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"But, dost thou hear? gavest thou my letter to Julia?\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"Ay sir: I, a lost mutton, gave your letter to her,\n"+
		"a laced mutton, and she, a laced mutton, gave me, a\n"+
		"lost mutton, nothing for my labour.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Here's too small a pasture for such store of muttons.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"If the ground be overcharged, you were best stick her.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Nay: in that you are astray, 'twere best pound you.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"Nay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me for\n"+
		"carrying your letter.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"You mistake; I mean the pound,--a pinfold.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"From a pound to a pin? fold it over and over,\n"+
		"'Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to\n"+
		"your lover.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"But what said she?\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"[First nodding] Ay.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Nod--Ay--why, that's noddy.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"You mistook, sir; I say, she did nod: and you ask\n"+
		"me if she did nod; and I say, 'Ay.'\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"And that set together is noddy.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"Now you have taken the pains to set it together,\n"+
		"take it for your pains.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"No, no; you shall have it for bearing the letter.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"Well, I perceive I must be fain to bear with you.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Why sir, how do you bear with me?\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"Marry, sir, the letter, very orderly; having nothing\n"+
		"but the word 'noddy' for my pains.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Beshrew me, but you have a quick wit.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Come come, open the matter in brief: what said she?\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"Open your purse, that the money and the matter may\n"+
		"be both at once delivered.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Well, sir, here is for your pains. What said she?\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"Truly, sir, I think you'll hardly win her.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Why, couldst thou perceive so much from her?\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"Sir, I could perceive nothing at all from her; no,\n"+
		"not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter:\n"+
		"and being so hard to me that brought your mind, I\n"+
		"fear she'll prove as hard to you in telling your\n"+
		"mind. Give her no token but stones; for she's as\n"+
		"hard as steel.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"What said she? nothing?\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"No, not so much as 'Take this for thy pains.' To\n"+
		"testify your bounty, I thank you, you have testerned\n"+
		"me; in requital whereof, henceforth carry your\n"+
		"letters yourself: and so, sir, I'll commend you to my master.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Go, go, be gone, to save your ship from wreck,\n"+
		"Which cannot perish having thee aboard,\n"+
		"Being destined to a drier death on shore.\n"+
		"Exit SPEED\n"+
		"I must go send some better messenger:\n"+
		"I fear my Julia would not deign my lines,\n"+
		"Receiving them from such a worthless post.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE II. The same. Garden of JULIA's house.\n"+
		"Enter JULlA and LUCETTA\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"But say, Lucetta, now we are alone,\n"+
		"Wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love?\n"+
		"LUCETTA\n"+
		"Ay, madam, so you stumble not unheedfully.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"Of all the fair resort of gentlemen\n"+
		"That every day with parle encounter me,\n"+
		"In thy opinion which is worthiest love?\n"+
		"LUCETTA\n"+
		"Please you repeat their names, I'll show my mind\n"+
		"According to my shallow simple skill.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"What think'st thou of the fair Sir Eglamour?\n"+
		"LUCETTA\n"+
		"As of a knight well-spoken, neat and fine;\n"+
		"But, were I you, he never should be mine.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"What think'st thou of the rich Mercatio?\n"+
		"LUCETTA\n"+
		"Well of his wealth; but of himself, so so.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"What think'st thou of the gentle Proteus?\n"+
		"LUCETTA\n"+
		"Lord, Lord! to see what folly reigns in us!\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"How now! what means this passion at his name?\n"+
		"LUCETTA\n"+
		"Pardon, dear madam: 'tis a passing shame\n"+
		"That I, unworthy body as I am,\n"+
		"Should censure thus on lovely gentlemen.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"Why not on Proteus, as of all the rest?\n"+
		"LUCETTA\n"+
		"Then thus: of many good I think him best.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"Your reason?\n"+
		"LUCETTA\n"+
		"I have no other, but a woman's reason;\n"+
		"I think him so because I think him so.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him?\n"+
		"LUCETTA\n"+
		"Ay, if you thought your love not cast away.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"Why he, of all the rest, hath never moved me.\n"+
		"LUCETTA\n"+
		"Yet he, of all the rest, I think, best loves ye.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"His little speaking shows his love but small.\n"+
		"LUCETTA\n"+
		"Fire that's closest kept burns most of all.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"They do not love that do not show their love.\n"+
		"LUCETTA\n"+
		"O, they love least that let men know their love.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"I would I knew his mind.\n"+
		"LUCETTA\n"+
		"Peruse this paper, madam.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"'To Julia.' Say, from whom?\n"+
		"LUCETTA\n"+
		"That the contents will show.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"Say, say, who gave it thee?\n"+
		"LUCETTA\n"+
		"Valentine's page; and sent, I think, from Proteus.\n"+
		"He would have given it you; but I, being in the way,\n"+
		"Did in your name receive it: pardon the\n"+
		"fault I pray.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"Now, by my modesty, a goodly broker!\n"+
		"Dare you presume to harbour wanton lines?\n"+
		"To whisper and conspire against my youth?\n"+
		"Now, trust me, 'tis an office of great worth\n"+
		"And you an officer fit for the place.\n"+
		"Or else return no more into my sight.\n"+
		"LUCETTA\n"+
		"To plead for love deserves more fee than hate.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"Will ye be gone?\n"+
		"LUCETTA\n"+
		"That you may ruminate.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"And yet I would I had o'erlooked the letter:\n"+
		"It were a shame to call her back again\n"+
		"And pray her to a fault for which I chid her.\n"+
		"What a fool is she, that knows I am a maid,\n"+
		"And would not force the letter to my view!\n"+
		"Since maids, in modesty, say 'no' to that\n"+
		"Which they would have the profferer construe 'ay.'\n"+
		"Fie, fie, how wayward is this foolish love\n"+
		"That, like a testy babe, will scratch the nurse\n"+
		"And presently all humbled kiss the rod!\n"+
		"How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence,\n"+
		"When willingly I would have had her here!\n"+
		"How angerly I taught my brow to frown,\n"+
		"When inward joy enforced my heart to smile!\n"+
		"My penance is to call Lucetta back\n"+
		"And ask remission for my folly past.\n"+
		"What ho! Lucetta!\n"+
		"Re-enter LUCETTA\n"+
		"LUCETTA\n"+
		"What would your ladyship?\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"Is't near dinner-time?\n"+
		"LUCETTA\n"+
		"I would it were,\n"+
		"That you might kill your stomach on your meat\n"+
		"And not upon your maid.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"What is't that you took up so gingerly?\n"+
		"LUCETTA\n"+
		"Nothing.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"Why didst thou stoop, then?\n"+
		"LUCETTA\n"+
		"To take a paper up that I let fall.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"And is that paper nothing?\n"+
		"LUCETTA\n"+
		"Nothing concerning me.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"Then let it lie for those that it concerns.\n"+
		"LUCETTA\n"+
		"Madam, it will not lie where it concerns\n"+
		"Unless it have a false interpeter.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.\n"+
		"LUCETTA\n"+
		"That I might sing it, madam, to a tune.\n"+
		"Give me a note: your ladyship can set.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"As little by such toys as may be possible.\n"+
		"Best sing it to the tune of 'Light o' love.'\n"+
		"LUCETTA\n"+
		"It is too heavy for so light a tune.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"Heavy! belike it hath some burden then?\n"+
		"LUCETTA\n"+
		"Ay, and melodious were it, would you sing it.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"And why not you?\n"+
		"LUCETTA\n"+
		"I cannot reach so high.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"Let's see your song. How now, minion!\n"+
		"LUCETTA\n"+
		"Keep tune there still, so you will sing it out:\n"+
		"And yet methinks I do not like this tune.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"You do not?\n"+
		"LUCETTA\n"+
		"No, madam; it is too sharp.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"You, minion, are too saucy.\n"+
		"LUCETTA\n"+
		"Nay, now you are too flat\n"+
		"And mar the concord with too harsh a descant:\n"+
		"There wanteth but a mean to fill your song.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"The mean is drown'd with your unruly bass.\n"+
		"LUCETTA\n"+
		"Indeed, I bid the base for Proteus.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"This babble shall not henceforth trouble me.\n"+
		"Here is a coil with protestation!\n"+
		"Tears the letter\n"+
		"Go get you gone, and let the papers lie:\n"+
		"You would be fingering them, to anger me.\n"+
		"LUCETTA\n"+
		"She makes it strange; but she would be best pleased\n"+
		"To be so anger'd with another letter.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"Nay, would I were so anger'd with the same!\n"+
		"O hateful hands, to tear such loving words!\n"+
		"Injurious wasps, to feed on such sweet honey\n"+
		"And kill the bees that yield it with your stings!\n"+
		"I'll kiss each several paper for amends.\n"+
		"Look, here is writ 'kind Julia.' Unkind Julia!\n"+
		"As in revenge of thy ingratitude,\n"+
		"I throw thy name against the bruising stones,\n"+
		"Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain.\n"+
		"And here is writ 'love-wounded Proteus.'\n"+
		"Poor wounded name! my bosom as a bed\n"+
		"Shall lodge thee till thy wound be thoroughly heal'd;\n"+
		"And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss.\n"+
		"But twice or thrice was 'Proteus' written down.\n"+
		"Be calm, good wind, blow not a word away\n"+
		"Till I have found each letter in the letter,\n"+
		"Except mine own name: that some whirlwind bear\n"+
		"Unto a ragged fearful-hanging rock\n"+
		"And throw it thence into the raging sea!\n"+
		"Lo, here in one line is his name twice writ,\n"+
		"'Poor forlorn Proteus, passionate Proteus,\n"+
		"To the sweet Julia:' that I'll tear away.\n"+
		"And yet I will not, sith so prettily\n"+
		"He couples it to his complaining names.\n"+
		"Thus will I fold them one on another:\n"+
		"Now kiss, embrace, contend, do what you will.\n"+
		"Re-enter LUCETTA\n"+
		"LUCETTA\n"+
		"Madam,\n"+
		"Dinner is ready, and your father stays.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"Well, let us go.\n"+
		"LUCETTA\n"+
		"What, shall these papers lie like tell-tales here?\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"If you respect them, best to take them up.\n"+
		"LUCETTA\n"+
		"Nay, I was taken up for laying them down:\n"+
		"Yet here they shall not lie, for catching cold.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"I see you have a month's mind to them.\n"+
		"LUCETTA\n"+
		"Ay, madam, you may say what sights you see;\n"+
		"I see things too, although you judge I wink.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"Come, come; will't please you go?\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. The same. ANTONIO's house.\n"+
		"Enter ANTONIO and PANTHINO\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Tell me, Panthino, what sad talk was that\n"+
		"Wherewith my brother held you in the cloister?\n"+
		"PANTHINO\n"+
		"'Twas of his nephew Proteus, your son.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Why, what of him?\n"+
		"PANTHINO\n"+
		"He wonder'd that your lordship\n"+
		"Would suffer him to spend his youth at home,\n"+
		"While other men, of slender reputation,\n"+
		"Put forth their sons to seek preferment out:\n"+
		"Some to the wars, to try their fortune there;\n"+
		"Some to discover islands far away;\n"+
		"Some to the studious universities.\n"+
		"For any or for all these exercises,\n"+
		"He said that Proteus your son was meet,\n"+
		"And did request me to importune you\n"+
		"To let him spend his time no more at home,\n"+
		"Which would be great impeachment to his age,\n"+
		"In having known no travel in his youth.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Nor need'st thou much importune me to that\n"+
		"Whereon this month I have been hammering.\n"+
		"I have consider'd well his loss of time\n"+
		"And how he cannot be a perfect man,\n"+
		"Not being tried and tutor'd in the world:\n"+
		"Experience is by industry achieved\n"+
		"And perfected by the swift course of time.\n"+
		"Then tell me, whither were I best to send him?\n"+
		"PANTHINO\n"+
		"I think your lordship is not ignorant\n"+
		"How his companion, youthful Valentine,\n"+
		"Attends the emperor in his royal court.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"I know it well.\n"+
		"PANTHINO\n"+
		"'Twere good, I think, your lordship sent him thither:\n"+
		"There shall he practise tilts and tournaments,\n"+
		"Hear sweet discourse, converse with noblemen.\n"+
		"And be in eye of every exercise\n"+
		"Worthy his youth and nobleness of birth.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"I like thy counsel; well hast thou advised:\n"+
		"And that thou mayst perceive how well I like it,\n"+
		"The execution of it shall make known.\n"+
		"Even with the speediest expedition\n"+
		"I will dispatch him to the emperor's court.\n"+
		"PANTHINO\n"+
		"To-morrow, may it please you, Don Alphonso,\n"+
		"With other gentlemen of good esteem,\n"+
		"Are journeying to salute the emperor\n"+
		"And to commend their service to his will.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Good company; with them shall Proteus go:\n"+
		"And, in good time! now will we break with him.\n"+
		"Enter PROTEUS\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Sweet love! sweet lines! sweet life!\n"+
		"Here is her hand, the agent of her heart;\n"+
		"Here is her oath for love, her honour's pawn.\n"+
		"O, that our fathers would applaud our loves,\n"+
		"To seal our happiness with their consents!\n"+
		"O heavenly Julia!\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"How now! what letter are you reading there?\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"May't please your lordship, 'tis a word or two\n"+
		"Of commendations sent from Valentine,\n"+
		"Deliver'd by a friend that came from him.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Lend me the letter; let me see what news.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"There is no news, my lord, but that he writes\n"+
		"How happily he lives, how well beloved\n"+
		"And daily graced by the emperor;\n"+
		"Wishing me with him, partner of his fortune.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"And how stand you affected to his wish?\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"As one relying on your lordship's will\n"+
		"And not depending on his friendly wish.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"My will is something sorted with his wish.\n"+
		"Muse not that I thus suddenly proceed;\n"+
		"For what I will, I will, and there an end.\n"+
		"I am resolved that thou shalt spend some time\n"+
		"With Valentinus in the emperor's court:\n"+
		"What maintenance he from his friends receives,\n"+
		"Like exhibition thou shalt have from me.\n"+
		"To-morrow be in readiness to go:\n"+
		"Excuse it not, for I am peremptory.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"My lord, I cannot be so soon provided:\n"+
		"Please you, deliberate a day or two.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Look, what thou want'st shall be sent after thee:\n"+
		"No more of stay! to-morrow thou must go.\n"+
		"Come on, Panthino: you shall be employ'd\n"+
		"To hasten on his expedition.\n"+
		"Exeunt ANTONIO and PANTHINO\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Thus have I shunn'd the fire for fear of burning,\n"+
		"And drench'd me in the sea, where I am drown'd.\n"+
		"I fear'd to show my father Julia's letter,\n"+
		"Lest he should take exceptions to my love;\n"+
		"And with the vantage of mine own excuse\n"+
		"Hath he excepted most against my love.\n"+
		"O, how this spring of love resembleth\n"+
		"The uncertain glory of an April day,\n"+
		"Which now shows all the beauty of the sun,\n"+
		"And by and by a cloud takes all away!\n"+
		"Re-enter PANTHINO\n"+
		"PANTHINO\n"+
		"Sir Proteus, your father calls for you:\n"+
		"He is in haste; therefore, I pray you to go.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Why, this it is: my heart accords thereto,\n"+
		"And yet a thousand times it answers 'no.'\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT II\n"+
		"SCENE I. Milan. The DUKE's palace.\n"+
		"Enter VALENTINE and SPEED\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"Sir, your glove.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Not mine; my gloves are on.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"Why, then, this may be yours, for this is but one.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Ha! let me see: ay, give it me, it's mine:\n"+
		"Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine!\n"+
		"Ah, Silvia, Silvia!\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"Madam Silvia! Madam Silvia!\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"How now, sirrah?\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"She is not within hearing, sir.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Why, sir, who bade you call her?\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"Your worship, sir; or else I mistook.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Well, you'll still be too forward.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"And yet I was last chidden for being too slow.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Go to, sir: tell me, do you know Madam Silvia?\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"She that your worship loves?\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Why, how know you that I am in love?\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"Marry, by these special marks: first, you have\n"+
		"learned, like Sir Proteus, to wreathe your arms,\n"+
		"like a malecontent; to relish a love-song, like a\n"+
		"robin-redbreast; to walk alone, like one that had\n"+
		"the pestilence; to sigh, like a school-boy that had\n"+
		"lost his A B C; to weep, like a young wench that had\n"+
		"buried her grandam; to fast, like one that takes\n"+
		"diet; to watch like one that fears robbing; to\n"+
		"speak puling, like a beggar at Hallowmas. You were\n"+
		"wont, when you laughed, to crow like a cock; when you\n"+
		"walked, to walk like one of the lions; when you\n"+
		"fasted, it was presently after dinner; when you\n"+
		"looked sadly, it was for want of money: and now you\n"+
		"are metamorphosed with a mistress, that, when I look\n"+
		"on you, I can hardly think you my master.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Are all these things perceived in me?\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"They are all perceived without ye.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Without me? they cannot.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"Without you? nay, that's certain, for, without you\n"+
		"were so simple, none else would: but you are so\n"+
		"without these follies, that these follies are within\n"+
		"you and shine through you like the water in an\n"+
		"urinal, that not an eye that sees you but is a\n"+
		"physician to comment on your malady.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"But tell me, dost thou know my lady Silvia?\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"She that you gaze on so as she sits at supper?\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Hast thou observed that? even she, I mean.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"Why, sir, I know her not.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Dost thou know her by my gazing on her, and yet\n"+
		"knowest her not?\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"Is she not hard-favoured, sir?\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Not so fair, boy, as well-favoured.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"Sir, I know that well enough.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"What dost thou know?\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"That she is not so fair as, of you, well-favoured.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"I mean that her beauty is exquisite, but her favour infinite.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"That's because the one is painted and the other out\n"+
		"of all count.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"How painted? and how out of count?\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"Marry, sir, so painted, to make her fair, that no\n"+
		"man counts of her beauty.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"How esteemest thou me? I account of her beauty.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"You never saw her since she was deformed.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"How long hath she been deformed?\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"Ever since you loved her.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"I have loved her ever since I saw her; and still I\n"+
		"see her beautiful.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"If you love her, you cannot see her.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Why?\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"Because Love is blind. O, that you had mine eyes;\n"+
		"or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to\n"+
		"have when you chid at Sir Proteus for going\n"+
		"ungartered!\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"What should I see then?\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"Your own present folly and her passing deformity:\n"+
		"for he, being in love, could not see to garter his\n"+
		"hose, and you, being in love, cannot see to put on your hose.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Belike, boy, then, you are in love; for last\n"+
		"morning you could not see to wipe my shoes.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"True, sir; I was in love with my bed: I thank you,\n"+
		"you swinged me for my love, which makes me the\n"+
		"bolder to chide you for yours.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"In conclusion, I stand affected to her.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"I would you were set, so your affection would cease.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Last night she enjoined me to write some lines to\n"+
		"one she loves.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"And have you?\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"I have.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"Are they not lamely writ?\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"No, boy, but as well as I can do them. Peace!\n"+
		"here she comes.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"[Aside] O excellent motion! O exceeding puppet!\n"+
		"Now will he interpret to her.\n"+
		"Enter SILVIA\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Madam and mistress, a thousand good-morrows.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"[Aside] O, give ye good even! here's a million of manners.\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"Sir Valentine and servant, to you two thousand.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"[Aside] He should give her interest and she gives it him.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"As you enjoin'd me, I have writ your letter\n"+
		"Unto the secret nameless friend of yours;\n"+
		"Which I was much unwilling to proceed in\n"+
		"But for my duty to your ladyship.\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"I thank you gentle servant: 'tis very clerkly done.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Now trust me, madam, it came hardly off;\n"+
		"For being ignorant to whom it goes\n"+
		"I writ at random, very doubtfully.\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"Perchance you think too much of so much pains?\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"No, madam; so it stead you, I will write\n"+
		"Please you command, a thousand times as much; And yet--\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"A pretty period! Well, I guess the sequel;\n"+
		"And yet I will not name it; and yet I care not;\n"+
		"And yet take this again; and yet I thank you,\n"+
		"Meaning henceforth to trouble you no more.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"[Aside] And yet you will; and yet another 'yet.'\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"What means your ladyship? do you not like it?\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"Yes, yes; the lines are very quaintly writ;\n"+
		"But since unwillingly, take them again.\n"+
		"Nay, take them.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Madam, they are for you.\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"Ay, ay: you writ them, sir, at my request;\n"+
		"But I will none of them; they are for you;\n"+
		"I would have had them writ more movingly.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Please you, I'll write your ladyship another.\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"And when it's writ, for my sake read it over,\n"+
		"And if it please you, so; if not, why, so.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"If it please me, madam, what then?\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"Why, if it please you, take it for your labour:\n"+
		"And so, good morrow, servant.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"O jest unseen, inscrutable, invisible,\n"+
		"As a nose on a man's face, or a weathercock on a steeple!\n"+
		"My master sues to her, and she hath\n"+
		"taught her suitor,\n"+
		"He being her pupil, to become her tutor.\n"+
		"O excellent device! was there ever heard a better,\n"+
		"That my master, being scribe, to himself should write\n"+
		"the letter?\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"How now, sir? what are you reasoning with yourself?\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"Nay, I was rhyming: 'tis you that have the reason.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"To do what?\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"To be a spokesman for Madam Silvia.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"To whom?\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"To yourself: why, she wooes you by a figure.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"What figure?\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"By a letter, I should say.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Why, she hath not writ to me?\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"What need she, when she hath made you write to\n"+
		"yourself? Why, do you not perceive the jest?\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"No, believe me.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"No believing you, indeed, sir. But did you perceive\n"+
		"her earnest?\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"She gave me none, except an angry word.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"Why, she hath given you a letter.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"That's the letter I writ to her friend.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"And that letter hath she delivered, and there an end.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"I would it were no worse.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"I'll warrant you, 'tis as well:\n"+
		"For often have you writ to her, and she, in modesty,\n"+
		"Or else for want of idle time, could not again reply;\n"+
		"Or fearing else some messenger that might her mind discover,\n"+
		"Herself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover.\n"+
		"All this I speak in print, for in print I found it.\n"+
		"Why muse you, sir? 'tis dinner-time.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"I have dined.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"Ay, but hearken, sir; though the chameleon Love can\n"+
		"feed on the air, I am one that am nourished by my\n"+
		"victuals, and would fain have meat. O, be not like\n"+
		"your mistress; be moved, be moved.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. Verona. JULIA'S house.\n"+
		"Enter PROTEUS and JULIA\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Have patience, gentle Julia.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"I must, where is no remedy.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"When possibly I can, I will return.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"If you turn not, you will return the sooner.\n"+
		"Keep this remembrance for thy Julia's sake.\n"+
		"Giving a ring\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Why then, we'll make exchange; here, take you this.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"And seal the bargain with a holy kiss.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Here is my hand for my true constancy;\n"+
		"And when that hour o'erslips me in the day\n"+
		"Wherein I sigh not, Julia, for thy sake,\n"+
		"The next ensuing hour some foul mischance\n"+
		"Torment me for my love's forgetfulness!\n"+
		"My father stays my coming; answer not;\n"+
		"The tide is now: nay, not thy tide of tears;\n"+
		"That tide will stay me longer than I should.\n"+
		"Julia, farewell!\n"+
		"Exit JULIA\n"+
		"What, gone without a word?\n"+
		"Ay, so true love should do: it cannot speak;\n"+
		"For truth hath better deeds than words to grace it.\n"+
		"Enter PANTHINO\n"+
		"PANTHINO\n"+
		"Sir Proteus, you are stay'd for.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Go; I come, I come.\n"+
		"Alas! this parting strikes poor lovers dumb.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. The same. A street.\n"+
		"Enter LAUNCE, leading a dog\n"+
		"LAUNCE\n"+
		"Nay, 'twill be this hour ere I have done weeping;\n"+
		"all the kind of the Launces have this very fault. I\n"+
		"have received my proportion, like the prodigious\n"+
		"son, and am going with Sir Proteus to the Imperial's\n"+
		"court. I think Crab, my dog, be the sourest-natured\n"+
		"dog that lives: my mother weeping, my father\n"+
		"wailing, my sister crying, our maid howling, our cat\n"+
		"wringing her hands, and all our house in a great\n"+
		"perplexity, yet did not this cruel-hearted cur shed\n"+
		"one tear: he is a stone, a very pebble stone, and\n"+
		"has no more pity in him than a dog: a Jew would have\n"+
		"wept to have seen our parting; why, my grandam,\n"+
		"having no eyes, look you, wept herself blind at my\n"+
		"parting. Nay, I'll show you the manner of it. This\n"+
		"shoe is my father: no, this left shoe is my father:\n"+
		"no, no, this left shoe is my mother: nay, that\n"+
		"cannot be so neither: yes, it is so, it is so, it\n"+
		"hath the worser sole. This shoe, with the hole in\n"+
		"it, is my mother, and this my father; a vengeance\n"+
		"on't! there 'tis: now, sit, this staff is my\n"+
		"sister, for, look you, she is as white as a lily and\n"+
		"as small as a wand: this hat is Nan, our maid: I\n"+
		"am the dog: no, the dog is himself, and I am the\n"+
		"dog--Oh! the dog is me, and I am myself; ay, so,\n"+
		"so. Now come I to my father; Father, your blessing:\n"+
		"now should not the shoe speak a word for weeping:\n"+
		"now should I kiss my father; well, he weeps on. Now\n"+
		"come I to my mother: O, that she could speak now\n"+
		"like a wood woman! Well, I kiss her; why, there\n"+
		"'tis; here's my mother's breath up and down. Now\n"+
		"come I to my sister; mark the moan she makes. Now\n"+
		"the dog all this while sheds not a tear nor speaks a\n"+
		"word; but see how I lay the dust with my tears.\n"+
		"Enter PANTHINO\n"+
		"PANTHINO\n"+
		"Launce, away, away, aboard! thy master is shipped\n"+
		"and thou art to post after with oars. What's the\n"+
		"matter? why weepest thou, man? Away, ass! You'll\n"+
		"lose the tide, if you tarry any longer.\n"+
		"LAUNCE\n"+
		"It is no matter if the tied were lost; for it is the\n"+
		"unkindest tied that ever any man tied.\n"+
		"PANTHINO\n"+
		"What's the unkindest tide?\n"+
		"LAUNCE\n"+
		"Why, he that's tied here, Crab, my dog.\n"+
		"PANTHINO\n"+
		"Tut, man, I mean thou'lt lose the flood, and, in\n"+
		"losing the flood, lose thy voyage, and, in losing\n"+
		"thy voyage, lose thy master, and, in losing thy\n"+
		"master, lose thy service, and, in losing thy\n"+
		"service,--Why dost thou stop my mouth?\n"+
		"LAUNCE\n"+
		"For fear thou shouldst lose thy tongue.\n"+
		"PANTHINO\n"+
		"Where should I lose my tongue?\n"+
		"LAUNCE\n"+
		"In thy tale.\n"+
		"PANTHINO\n"+
		"In thy tail!\n"+
		"LAUNCE\n"+
		"Lose the tide, and the voyage, and the master, and\n"+
		"the service, and the tied! Why, man, if the river\n"+
		"were dry, I am able to fill it with my tears; if the\n"+
		"wind were down, I could drive the boat with my sighs.\n"+
		"PANTHINO\n"+
		"Come, come away, man; I was sent to call thee.\n"+
		"LAUNCE\n"+
		"Sir, call me what thou darest.\n"+
		"PANTHINO\n"+
		"Wilt thou go?\n"+
		"LAUNCE\n"+
		"Well, I will go.\n"+

		"Mistress?\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"Master, Sir Thurio frowns on you.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Ay, boy, it's for love.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"Not of you.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Of my mistress, then.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"'Twere good you knocked him.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"Servant, you are sad.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Indeed, madam, I seem so.\n"+
		"THURIO\n"+
		"Seem you that you are not?\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Haply I do.\n"+
		"THURIO\n"+
		"So do counterfeits.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"So do you.\n"+
		"THURIO\n"+
		"What seem I that I am not?\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Wise.\n"+
		"THURIO\n"+
		"What instance of the contrary?\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Your folly.\n"+
		"THURIO\n"+
		"And how quote you my folly?\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"I quote it in your jerkin.\n"+
		"THURIO\n"+
		"My jerkin is a doublet.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Well, then, I'll double your folly.\n"+
		"THURIO\n"+
		"How?\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"What, angry, Sir Thurio! do you change colour?\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Give him leave, madam; he is a kind of chameleon.\n"+
		"THURIO\n"+
		"That hath more mind to feed on your blood than live\n"+
		"in your air.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"You have said, sir.\n"+
		"THURIO\n"+
		"Ay, sir, and done too, for this time.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"I know it well, sir; you always end ere you begin.\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"A fine volley of words, gentlemen, and quickly shot off.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"'Tis indeed, madam; we thank the giver.\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"Who is that, servant?\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Yourself, sweet lady; for you gave the fire. Sir\n"+
		"Thurio borrows his wit from your ladyship's looks,\n"+
		"and spends what he borrows kindly in your company.\n"+
		"THURIO\n"+
		"Sir, if you spend word for word with me, I shall\n"+
		"make your wit bankrupt.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"I know it well, sir; you have an exchequer of words,\n"+
		"and, I think, no other treasure to give your\n"+
		"followers, for it appears by their bare liveries,\n"+
		"that they live by your bare words.\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"No more, gentlemen, no more:--here comes my father.\n"+
		"Enter DUKE\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"Now, daughter Silvia, you are hard beset.\n"+
		"Sir Valentine, your father's in good health:\n"+
		"What say you to a letter from your friends\n"+
		"Of much good news?\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"My lord, I will be thankful.\n"+
		"To any happy messenger from thence.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"Know ye Don Antonio, your countryman?\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Ay, my good lord, I know the gentleman\n"+
		"To be of worth and worthy estimation\n"+
		"And not without desert so well reputed.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"Hath he not a son?\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Ay, my good lord; a son that well deserves\n"+
		"The honour and regard of such a father.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"You know him well?\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"I know him as myself; for from our infancy\n"+
		"We have conversed and spent our hours together:\n"+
		"And though myself have been an idle truant,\n"+
		"Omitting the sweet benefit of time\n"+
		"To clothe mine age with angel-like perfection,\n"+
		"Yet hath Sir Proteus, for that's his name,\n"+
		"Made use and fair advantage of his days;\n"+
		"His years but young, but his experience old;\n"+
		"His head unmellow'd, but his judgment ripe;\n"+
		"And, in a word, for far behind his worth\n"+
		"Comes all the praises that I now bestow,\n"+
		"He is complete in feature and in mind\n"+
		"With all good grace to grace a gentleman.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"Beshrew me, sir, but if he make this good,\n"+
		"He is as worthy for an empress' love\n"+
		"As meet to be an emperor's counsellor.\n"+
		"Well, sir, this gentleman is come to me,\n"+
		"With commendation from great potentates;\n"+
		"And here he means to spend his time awhile:\n"+
		"I think 'tis no unwelcome news to you.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Should I have wish'd a thing, it had been he.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"Welcome him then according to his worth.\n"+
		"Silvia, I speak to you, and you, Sir Thurio;\n"+
		"For Valentine, I need not cite him to it:\n"+
		"I will send him hither to you presently.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"This is the gentleman I told your ladyship\n"+
		"Had come along with me, but that his mistress\n"+
		"Did hold his eyes lock'd in her crystal looks.\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"Belike that now she hath enfranchised them\n"+
		"Upon some other pawn for fealty.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Nay, sure, I think she holds them prisoners still.\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"Nay, then he should be blind; and, being blind\n"+
		"How could he see his way to seek out you?\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Why, lady, Love hath twenty pair of eyes.\n"+
		"THURIO\n"+
		"They say that Love hath not an eye at all.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"To see such lovers, Thurio, as yourself:\n"+
		"Upon a homely object Love can wink.\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"Have done, have done; here comes the gentleman.\n"+
		"Exit THURIO\n"+
		"Enter PROTEUS\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Welcome, dear Proteus! Mistress, I beseech you,\n"+
		"Confirm his welcome with some special favour.\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"His worth is warrant for his welcome hither,\n"+
		"If this be he you oft have wish'd to hear from.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Mistress, it is: sweet lady, entertain him\n"+
		"To be my fellow-servant to your ladyship.\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"Too low a mistress for so high a servant.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Not so, sweet lady: but too mean a servant\n"+
		"To have a look of such a worthy mistress.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Leave off discourse of disability:\n"+
		"Sweet lady, entertain him for your servant.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"My duty will I boast of; nothing else.\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"And duty never yet did want his meed:\n"+
		"Servant, you are welcome to a worthless mistress.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"I'll die on him that says so but yourself.\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"That you are welcome?\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"That you are worthless.\n"+
		"Re-enter THURIO\n"+
		"THURIO\n"+
		"Madam, my lord your father would speak with you.\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"I wait upon his pleasure. Come, Sir Thurio,\n"+
		"Go with me. Once more, new servant, welcome:\n"+
		"I'll leave you to confer of home affairs;\n"+
		"When you have done, we look to hear from you.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"We'll both attend upon your ladyship.\n"+
		"Exeunt SILVIA and THURIO\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Now, tell me, how do all from whence you came?\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Your friends are well and have them much commended.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"And how do yours?\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"I left them all in health.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"How does your lady? and how thrives your love?\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"My tales of love were wont to weary you;\n"+
		"I know you joy not in a love discourse.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Ay, Proteus, but that life is alter'd now:\n"+
		"I have done penance for contemning Love,\n"+
		"Whose high imperious thoughts have punish'd me\n"+
		"With bitter fasts, with penitential groans,\n"+
		"With nightly tears and daily heart-sore sighs;\n"+
		"For in revenge of my contempt of love,\n"+
		"Love hath chased sleep from my enthralled eyes\n"+
		"And made them watchers of mine own heart's sorrow.\n"+
		"O gentle Proteus, Love's a mighty lord,\n"+
		"And hath so humbled me, as, I confess,\n"+
		"There is no woe to his correction,\n"+
		"Nor to his service no such joy on earth.\n"+
		"Now no discourse, except it be of love;\n"+
		"Now can I break my fast, dine, sup and sleep,\n"+
		"Upon the very naked name of love.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.\n"+
		"Was this the idol that you worship so?\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Even she; and is she not a heavenly saint?\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"No; but she is an earthly paragon.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Call her divine.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"I will not flatter her.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"O, flatter me; for love delights in praises.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"When I was sick, you gave me bitter pills,\n"+
		"And I must minister the like to you.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Then speak the truth by her; if not divine,\n"+
		"Yet let her be a principality,\n"+
		"Sovereign to all the creatures on the earth.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Except my mistress.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Sweet, except not any;\n"+
		"Except thou wilt except against my love.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Have I not reason to prefer mine own?\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"And I will help thee to prefer her too:\n"+
		"She shall be dignified with this high honour--\n"+
		"To bear my lady's train, lest the base earth\n"+
		"Should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss\n"+
		"And, of so great a favour growing proud,\n"+
		"Disdain to root the summer-swelling flower\n"+
		"And make rough winter everlastingly.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Why, Valentine, what braggardism is this?\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Pardon me, Proteus: all I can is nothing\n"+
		"To her whose worth makes other worthies nothing;\n"+
		"She is alone.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Then let her alone.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Not for the world: why, man, she is mine own,\n"+
		"And I as rich in having such a jewel\n"+
		"As twenty seas, if all their sand were pearl,\n"+
		"The water nectar and the rocks pure gold.\n"+
		"Forgive me that I do not dream on thee,\n"+
		"Because thou see'st me dote upon my love.\n"+
		"My foolish rival, that her father likes\n"+
		"Only for his possessions are so huge,\n"+
		"Is gone with her along, and I must after,\n"+
		"For love, thou know'st, is full of jealousy.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"But she loves you?\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Ay, and we are betroth'd: nay, more, our,\n"+
		"marriage-hour,\n"+
		"With all the cunning manner of our flight,\n"+
		"Determined of; how I must climb her window,\n"+
		"The ladder made of cords, and all the means\n"+
		"Plotted and 'greed on for my happiness.\n"+
		"Good Proteus, go with me to my chamber,\n"+
		"In these affairs to aid me with thy counsel.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Go on before; I shall inquire you forth:\n"+
		"I must unto the road, to disembark\n"+
		"Some necessaries that I needs must use,\n"+
		"And then I'll presently attend you.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Will you make haste?\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"I will.\n"+
		"Exit VALENTINE\n"+
		"Even as one heat another heat expels,\n"+
		"Or as one nail by strength drives out another,\n"+
		"So the remembrance of my former love\n"+
		"Is by a newer object quite forgotten.\n"+
		"Is it mine, or Valentine's praise,\n"+
		"Her true perfection, or my false transgression,\n"+
		"That makes me reasonless to reason thus?\n"+
		"She is fair; and so is Julia that I love--\n"+
		"That I did love, for now my love is thaw'd;\n"+
		"Which, like a waxen image, 'gainst a fire,\n"+
		"Bears no impression of the thing it was.\n"+
		"Methinks my zeal to Valentine is cold,\n"+
		"And that I love him not as I was wont.\n"+
		"O, but I love his lady too too much,\n"+
		"And that's the reason I love him so little.\n"+
		"How shall I dote on her with more advice,\n"+
		"That thus without advice begin to love her!\n"+
		"'Tis but her picture I have yet beheld,\n"+
		"And that hath dazzled my reason's light;\n"+
		"But when I look on her perfections,\n"+
		"There is no reason but I shall be blind.\n"+
		"If I can cheque my erring love, I will;\n"+
		"If not, to compass her I'll use my skill.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE V. The same. A street.\n"+
		"Enter SPEED and LAUNCE severally\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"Launce! by mine honesty, welcome to Milan!\n"+
		"LAUNCE\n"+
		"Forswear not thyself, sweet youth, for I am not\n"+
		"welcome. I reckon this always, that a man is never\n"+
		"undone till he be hanged, nor never welcome to a\n"+
		"place till some certain shot be paid and the hostess\n"+
		"say 'Welcome!'\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"Come on, you madcap, I'll to the alehouse with you\n"+
		"presently; where, for one shot of five pence, thou\n"+
		"shalt have five thousand welcomes. But, sirrah, how\n"+
		"did thy master part with Madam Julia?\n"+
		"LAUNCE\n"+
		"Marry, after they closed in earnest, they parted very\n"+
		"fairly in jest.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"But shall she marry him?\n"+
		"LAUNCE\n"+
		"No.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"How then? shall he marry her?\n"+
		"LAUNCE\n"+
		"No, neither.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"What, are they broken?\n"+
		"LAUNCE\n"+
		"No, they are both as whole as a fish.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"Why, then, how stands the matter with them?\n"+
		"LAUNCE\n"+
		"Marry, thus: when it stands well with him, it\n"+
		"stands well with her.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"What an ass art thou! I understand thee not.\n"+
		"LAUNCE\n"+
		"What a block art thou, that thou canst not! My\n"+
		"staff understands me.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"What thou sayest?\n"+
		"LAUNCE\n"+
		"Ay, and what I do too: look thee, I'll but lean,\n"+
		"and my staff understands me.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"It stands under thee, indeed.\n"+
		"LAUNCE\n"+
		"Why, stand-under and under-stand is all one.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"But tell me true, will't be a match?\n"+
		"LAUNCE\n"+
		"Ask my dog: if he say ay, it will! if he say no,\n"+
		"it will; if he shake his tail and say nothing, it will.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"The conclusion is then that it will.\n"+
		"LAUNCE\n"+
		"Thou shalt never get such a secret from me but by a parable.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"'Tis well that I get it so. But, Launce, how sayest\n"+
		"thou, that my master is become a notable lover?\n"+
		"LAUNCE\n"+
		"I never knew him otherwise.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"Than how?\n"+
		"LAUNCE\n"+
		"A notable lubber, as thou reportest him to be.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"Why, thou whoreson ass, thou mistakest me.\n"+
		"LAUNCE\n"+
		"Why, fool, I meant not thee; I meant thy master.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"I tell thee, my master is become a hot lover.\n"+
		"LAUNCE\n"+
		"Why, I tell thee, I care not though he burn himself\n"+
		"in love. If thou wilt, go with me to the alehouse;\n"+
		"if not, thou art an Hebrew, a Jew, and not worth the\n"+
		"name of a Christian.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"Why?\n"+
		"LAUNCE\n"+
		"Because thou hast not so much charity in thee as to\n"+
		"go to the ale with a Christian. Wilt thou go?\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"At thy service.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE VI. The same. The DUKE'S palace.\n"+
		"Enter PROTEUS\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"To leave my Julia, shall I be forsworn;\n"+
		"To love fair Silvia, shall I be forsworn;\n"+
		"To wrong my friend, I shall be much forsworn;\n"+
		"And even that power which gave me first my oath\n"+
		"Provokes me to this threefold perjury;\n"+
		"Love bade me swear and Love bids me forswear.\n"+
		"O sweet-suggesting Love, if thou hast sinned,\n"+
		"Teach me, thy tempted subject, to excuse it!\n"+
		"At first I did adore a twinkling star,\n"+
		"But now I worship a celestial sun.\n"+
		"Unheedful vows may heedfully be broken,\n"+
		"And he wants wit that wants resolved will\n"+
		"To learn his wit to exchange the bad for better.\n"+
		"Fie, fie, unreverend tongue! to call her bad,\n"+
		"Whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferr'd\n"+
		"With twenty thousand soul-confirming oaths.\n"+
		"I cannot leave to love, and yet I do;\n"+
		"But there I leave to love where I should love.\n"+
		"Julia I lose and Valentine I lose:\n"+
		"If I keep them, I needs must lose myself;\n"+
		"If I lose them, thus find I by their loss\n"+
		"For Valentine myself, for Julia Silvia.\n"+
		"I to myself am dearer than a friend,\n"+
		"For love is still most precious in itself;\n"+
		"And Silvia--witness Heaven, that made her fair!--\n"+
		"Shows Julia but a swarthy Ethiope.\n"+
		"I will forget that Julia is alive,\n"+
		"Remembering that my love to her is dead;\n"+
		"And Valentine I'll hold an enemy,\n"+
		"Aiming at Silvia as a sweeter friend.\n"+
		"I cannot now prove constant to myself,\n"+
		"Without some treachery used to Valentine.\n"+
		"This night he meaneth with a corded ladder\n"+
		"To climb celestial Silvia's chamber-window,\n"+
		"Myself in counsel, his competitor.\n"+
		"Now presently I'll give her father notice\n"+
		"Of their disguising and pretended flight;\n"+
		"Who, all enraged, will banish Valentine;\n"+
		"For Thurio, he intends, shall wed his daughter;\n"+
		"But, Valentine being gone, I'll quickly cross\n"+
		"By some sly trick blunt Thurio's dull proceeding.\n"+
		"Love, lend me wings to make my purpose swift,\n"+
		"As thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift!\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE VII. Verona. JULIA'S house.\n"+
		"Enter JULIA and LUCETTA\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"Counsel, Lucetta; gentle girl, assist me;\n"+
		"And even in kind love I do conjure thee,\n"+
		"Who art the table wherein all my thoughts\n"+
		"Are visibly character'd and engraved,\n"+
		"To lesson me and tell me some good mean\n"+
		"How, with my honour, I may undertake\n"+
		"A journey to my loving Proteus.\n"+
		"LUCETTA\n"+
		"Alas, the way is wearisome and long!\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"A true-devoted pilgrim is not weary\n"+
		"To measure kingdoms with his feeble steps;\n"+
		"Much less shall she that hath Love's wings to fly,\n"+
		"And when the flight is made to one so dear,\n"+
		"Of such divine perfection, as Sir Proteus.\n"+
		"LUCETTA\n"+
		"Better forbear till Proteus make return.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"O, know'st thou not his looks are my soul's food?\n"+
		"Pity the dearth that I have pined in,\n"+
		"By longing for that food so long a time.\n"+
		"Didst thou but know the inly touch of love,\n"+
		"Thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow\n"+
		"As seek to quench the fire of love with words.\n"+
		"LUCETTA\n"+
		"I do not seek to quench your love's hot fire,\n"+
		"But qualify the fire's extreme rage,\n"+
		"Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"The more thou damm'st it up, the more it burns.\n"+
		"The current that with gentle murmur glides,\n"+
		"Thou know'st, being stopp'd, impatiently doth rage;\n"+
		"But when his fair course is not hindered,\n"+
		"He makes sweet music with the enamell'ed stones,\n"+
		"Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge\n"+
		"He overtaketh in his pilgrimage,\n"+
		"And so by many winding nooks he strays\n"+
		"With willing sport to the wild ocean.\n"+
		"Then let me go and hinder not my course\n"+
		"I'll be as patient as a gentle stream\n"+
		"And make a pastime of each weary step,\n"+
		"Till the last step have brought me to my love;\n"+
		"And there I'll rest, as after much turmoil\n"+
		"A blessed soul doth in Elysium.\n"+
		"LUCETTA\n"+
		"But in what habit will you go along?\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"Not like a woman; for I would prevent\n"+
		"The loose encounters of lascivious men:\n"+
		"Gentle Lucetta, fit me with such weeds\n"+
		"As may beseem some well-reputed page.\n"+
		"LUCETTA\n"+
		"Why, then, your ladyship must cut your hair.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"No, girl, I'll knit it up in silken strings\n"+
		"With twenty odd-conceited true-love knots.\n"+
		"To be fantastic may become a youth\n"+
		"Of greater time than I shall show to be.\n"+
		"LUCETTA\n"+
		"What fashion, madam shall I make your breeches?\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"That fits as well as 'Tell me, good my lord,\n"+
		"What compass will you wear your farthingale?'\n"+
		"Why even what fashion thou best likest, Lucetta.\n"+
		"LUCETTA\n"+
		"You must needs have them with a codpiece, madam.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"Out, out, Lucetta! that would be ill-favour'd.\n"+
		"LUCETTA\n"+
		"A round hose, madam, now's not worth a pin,\n"+
		"Unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"Lucetta, as thou lovest me, let me have\n"+
		"What thou thinkest meet and is most mannerly.\n"+
		"But tell me, wench, how will the world repute me\n"+
		"For undertaking so unstaid a journey?\n"+
		"I fear me, it will make me scandalized.\n"+
		"LUCETTA\n"+
		"If you think so, then stay at home and go not.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"Nay, that I will not.\n"+
		"LUCETTA\n"+
		"Then never dream on infamy, but go.\n"+
		"If Proteus like your journey when you come,\n"+
		"No matter who's displeased when you are gone:\n"+
		"I fear me, he will scarce be pleased withal.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"That is the least, Lucetta, of my fear:\n"+
		"A thousand oaths, an ocean of his tears\n"+
		"And instances of infinite of love\n"+
		"Warrant me welcome to my Proteus.\n"+
		"LUCETTA\n"+
		"All these are servants to deceitful men.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"Base men, that use them to so base effect!\n"+
		"But truer stars did govern Proteus' birth\n"+
		"His words are bonds, his oaths are oracles,\n"+
		"His love sincere, his thoughts immaculate,\n"+
		"His tears pure messengers sent from his heart,\n"+
		"His heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth.\n"+
		"LUCETTA\n"+
		"Pray heaven he prove so, when you come to him!\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"Now, as thou lovest me, do him not that wrong\n"+
		"To bear a hard opinion of his truth:\n"+
		"Only deserve my love by loving him;\n"+
		"And presently go with me to my chamber,\n"+
		"To take a note of what I stand in need of,\n"+
		"To furnish me upon my longing journey.\n"+
		"All that is mine I leave at thy dispose,\n"+
		"My goods, my lands, my reputation;\n"+
		"Only, in lieu thereof, dispatch me hence.\n"+
		"Come, answer not, but to it presently!\n"+
		"I am impatient of my tarriance.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT III\n"+
		"SCENE I. Milan. The DUKE's palace.\n"+
		"Enter DUKE, THURIO, and PROTEUS\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"Sir Thurio, give us leave, I pray, awhile;\n"+
		"We have some secrets to confer about.\n"+
		"Exit THURIO\n"+
		"Now, tell me, Proteus, what's your will with me?\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"My gracious lord, that which I would discover\n"+
		"The law of friendship bids me to conceal;\n"+
		"But when I call to mind your gracious favours\n"+
		"Done to me, undeserving as I am,\n"+
		"My duty pricks me on to utter that\n"+
		"Which else no worldly good should draw from me.\n"+
		"Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend,\n"+
		"This night intends to steal away your daughter:\n"+
		"Myself am one made privy to the plot.\n"+
		"I know you have determined to bestow her\n"+
		"On Thurio, whom your gentle daughter hates;\n"+
		"And should she thus be stol'n away from you,\n"+
		"It would be much vexation to your age.\n"+
		"Thus, for my duty's sake, I rather chose\n"+
		"To cross my friend in his intended drift\n"+
		"Than, by concealing it, heap on your head\n"+
		"A pack of sorrows which would press you down,\n"+
		"Being unprevented, to your timeless grave.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"Proteus, I thank thee for thine honest care;\n"+
		"Which to requite, command me while I live.\n"+
		"This love of theirs myself have often seen,\n"+
		"Haply when they have judged me fast asleep,\n"+
		"And oftentimes have purposed to forbid\n"+
		"Sir Valentine her company and my court:\n"+
		"But fearing lest my jealous aim might err\n"+
		"And so unworthily disgrace the man,\n"+
		"A rashness that I ever yet have shunn'd,\n"+
		"I gave him gentle looks, thereby to find\n"+
		"That which thyself hast now disclosed to me.\n"+
		"And, that thou mayst perceive my fear of this,\n"+
		"Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested,\n"+
		"I nightly lodge her in an upper tower,\n"+
		"The key whereof myself have ever kept;\n"+
		"And thence she cannot be convey'd away.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Know, noble lord, they have devised a mean\n"+
		"How he her chamber-window will ascend\n"+
		"And with a corded ladder fetch her down;\n"+
		"For which the youthful lover now is gone\n"+
		"And this way comes he with it presently;\n"+
		"Where, if it please you, you may intercept him.\n"+
		"But, good my Lord, do it so cunningly\n"+
		"That my discovery be not aimed at;\n"+
		"For love of you, not hate unto my friend,\n"+
		"Hath made me publisher of this pretence.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"Upon mine honour, he shall never know\n"+
		"That I had any light from thee of this.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Adieu, my Lord; Sir Valentine is coming.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"Enter VALENTINE\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"Sir Valentine, whither away so fast?\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Please it your grace, there is a messenger\n"+
		"That stays to bear my letters to my friends,\n"+
		"And I am going to deliver them.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"Be they of much import?\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"The tenor of them doth but signify\n"+
		"My health and happy being at your court.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"Nay then, no matter; stay with me awhile;\n"+
		"I am to break with thee of some affairs\n"+
		"That touch me near, wherein thou must be secret.\n"+
		"'Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought\n"+
		"To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"I know it well, my Lord; and, sure, the match\n"+
		"Were rich and honourable; besides, the gentleman\n"+
		"Is full of virtue, bounty, worth and qualities\n"+
		"Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter:\n"+
		"Cannot your Grace win her to fancy him?\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"No, trust me; she is peevish, sullen, froward,\n"+
		"Proud, disobedient, stubborn, lacking duty,\n"+
		"Neither regarding that she is my child\n"+
		"Nor fearing me as if I were her father;\n"+
		"And, may I say to thee, this pride of hers,\n"+
		"Upon advice, hath drawn my love from her;\n"+
		"And, where I thought the remnant of mine age\n"+
		"Should have been cherish'd by her child-like duty,\n"+
		"I now am full resolved to take a wife\n"+
		"And turn her out to who will take her in:\n"+
		"Then let her beauty be her wedding-dower;\n"+
		"For me and my possessions she esteems not.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"What would your Grace have me to do in this?\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"There is a lady in Verona here\n"+
		"Whom I affect; but she is nice and coy\n"+
		"And nought esteems my aged eloquence:\n"+
		"Now therefore would I have thee to my tutor--\n"+
		"For long agone I have forgot to court;\n"+
		"Besides, the fashion of the time is changed--\n"+
		"How and which way I may bestow myself\n"+
		"To be regarded in her sun-bright eye.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Win her with gifts, if she respect not words:\n"+
		"Dumb jewels often in their silent kind\n"+
		"More than quick words do move a woman's mind.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"But she did scorn a present that I sent her.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"A woman sometimes scorns what best contents her.\n"+
		"Send her another; never give her o'er;\n"+
		"For scorn at first makes after-love the more.\n"+
		"If she do frown, 'tis not in hate of you,\n"+
		"But rather to beget more love in you:\n"+
		"If she do chide, 'tis not to have you gone;\n"+
		"For why, the fools are mad, if left alone.\n"+
		"Take no repulse, whatever she doth say;\n"+
		"For 'get you gone,' she doth not mean 'away!'\n"+
		"Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces;\n"+
		"Though ne'er so black, say they have angels' faces.\n"+
		"That man that hath a tongue, I say, is no man,\n"+
		"If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"But she I mean is promised by her friends\n"+
		"Unto a youthful gentleman of worth,\n"+
		"And kept severely from resort of men,\n"+
		"That no man hath access by day to her.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Why, then, I would resort to her by night.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"Ay, but the doors be lock'd and keys kept safe,\n"+
		"That no man hath recourse to her by night.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"What lets but one may enter at her window?\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,\n"+
		"And built so shelving that one cannot climb it\n"+
		"Without apparent hazard of his life.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Why then, a ladder quaintly made of cords,\n"+
		"To cast up, with a pair of anchoring hooks,\n"+
		"Would serve to scale another Hero's tower,\n"+
		"So bold Leander would adventure it.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"Now, as thou art a gentleman of blood,\n"+
		"Advise me where I may have such a ladder.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"When would you use it? pray, sir, tell me that.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"This very night; for Love is like a child,\n"+
		"That longs for every thing that he can come by.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"By seven o'clock I'll get you such a ladder.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"But, hark thee; I will go to her alone:\n"+
		"How shall I best convey the ladder thither?\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"It will be light, my lord, that you may bear it\n"+
		"Under a cloak that is of any length.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Ay, my good lord.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"Then let me see thy cloak:\n"+
		"I'll get me one of such another length.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Why, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?\n"+
		"I pray thee, let me feel thy cloak upon me.\n"+
		"What letter is this same? What's here? 'To Silvia'!\n"+
		"And here an engine fit for my proceeding.\n"+
		"I'll be so bold to break the seal for once.\n"+
		"Reads\n"+
		"'My thoughts do harbour with my Silvia nightly,\n"+
		"And slaves they are to me that send them flying:\n"+
		"O, could their master come and go as lightly,\n"+
		"Himself would lodge where senseless they are lying!\n"+
		"My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them:\n"+
		"While I, their king, that hither them importune,\n"+
		"Do curse the grace that with such grace hath bless'd them,\n"+
		"Because myself do want my servants' fortune:\n"+
		"I curse myself, for they are sent by me,\n"+
		"That they should harbour where their lord would be.'\n"+
		"What's here?\n"+
		"'Silvia, this night I will enfranchise thee.'\n"+
		"'Tis so; and here's the ladder for the purpose.\n"+
		"Why, Phaeton,--for thou art Merops' son,--\n"+
		"Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car\n"+
		"And with thy daring folly burn the world?\n"+
		"Wilt thou reach stars, because they shine on thee?\n"+
		"Go, base intruder! overweening slave!\n"+
		"Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates,\n"+
		"And think my patience, more than thy desert,\n"+
		"Is privilege for thy departure hence:\n"+
		"Thank me for this more than for all the favours\n"+
		"Which all too much I have bestow'd on thee.\n"+
		"But if thou linger in my territories\n"+
		"Longer than swiftest expedition\n"+
		"Will give thee time to leave our royal court,\n"+
		"By heaven! my wrath shall far exceed the love\n"+

		"And why not death rather than living torment?\n"+

		"Is self from self: a deadly banishment!\n"+
		"What light is light, if Silvia be not seen?\n"+

		"Valentine?\n"+

		"No.\n"+

		"Who then? his spirit?\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Neither.\n"+

		"Nothing.\n"+

		"Why, sir, I'll strike nothing: I pray you,--\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Sirrah, I say, forbear. Friend Valentine, a word.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"My ears are stopt and cannot hear good news,\n"+
		"So much of bad already hath possess'd them.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Then in dumb silence will I bury mine,\n"+

		"No, Valentine.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"No Valentine, indeed, for sacred Silvia.\n"+

		"No, Valentine.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"No Valentine, if Silvia have forsworn me.\n"+

		"Sir, there is a proclamation that you are vanished.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"That thou art banished--O, that's the news!--\n"+
		"From hence, from Silvia and from me thy friend.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"O, I have fed upon this woe already,\n"+
		"And now excess of it will make me surfeit.\n"+
		"Doth Silvia know that I am banished?\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Ay, ay; and she hath offer'd to the doom--\n"+
		"Which, unreversed, stands in effectual force--\n"+
		"A sea of melting pearl, which some call tears:\n"+
		"Those at her father's churlish feet she tender'd;\n"+
		"With them, upon her knees, her humble self;\n"+
		"Wringing her hands, whose whiteness so became them\n"+
		"As if but now they waxed pale for woe:\n"+
		"But neither bended knees, pure hands held up,\n"+
		"Sad sighs, deep groans, nor silver-shedding tears,\n"+
		"Could penetrate her uncompassionate sire;\n"+
		"But Valentine, if he be ta'en, must die.\n"+
		"Besides, her intercession chafed him so,\n"+
		"When she for thy repeal was suppliant,\n"+
		"That to close prison he commanded her,\n"+
		"With many bitter threats of biding there.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"No more; unless the next word that thou speak'st\n"+
		"Have some malignant power upon my life:\n"+
		"If so, I pray thee, breathe it in mine ear,\n"+
		"As ending anthem of my endless dolour.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Cease to lament for that thou canst not help,\n"+

		"SCENE II. The same. The DUKE's palace.\n"+

		"Sir Thurio, fear not but that she will love you,\n"+
		"Now Valentine is banish'd from her sight.\n"+
		"THURIO\n"+
		"Since his exile she hath despised me most,\n"+
		"Forsworn my company and rail'd at me,\n"+
		"That I am desperate of obtaining her.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"This weak impress of love is as a figure\n"+
		"Trenched in ice, which with an hour's heat\n"+
		"Dissolves to water and doth lose his form.\n"+
		"A little time will melt her frozen thoughts\n"+
		"And worthless Valentine shall be forgot.\n"+
		"Enter PROTEUS\n"+
		"How now, Sir Proteus! Is your countryman\n"+
		"According to our proclamation gone?\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Gone, my good lord.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"My daughter takes his going grievously.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"A little time, my lord, will kill that grief.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"So I believe; but Thurio thinks not so.\n"+
		"Proteus, the good conceit I hold of thee--\n"+
		"For thou hast shown some sign of good desert--\n"+
		"Makes me the better to confer with thee.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Longer than I prove loyal to your grace\n"+
		"Let me not live to look upon your grace.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"Thou know'st how willingly I would effect\n"+
		"The match between Sir Thurio and my daughter.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"I do, my lord.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"And also, I think, thou art not ignorant\n"+
		"How she opposes her against my will\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"She did, my lord, when Valentine was here.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"Ay, and perversely she persevers so.\n"+
		"What might we do to make the girl forget\n"+
		"The love of Valentine and love Sir Thurio?\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"The best way is to slander Valentine\n"+
		"With falsehood, cowardice and poor descent,\n"+
		"Three things that women highly hold in hate.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"Ay, but she'll think that it is spoke in hate.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Ay, if his enemy deliver it:\n"+
		"Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken\n"+
		"By one whom she esteemeth as his friend.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"Then you must undertake to slander him.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"And that, my lord, I shall be loath to do:\n"+
		"'Tis an ill office for a gentleman,\n"+
		"Especially against his very friend.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"Where your good word cannot advantage him,\n"+
		"Your slander never can endamage him;\n"+
		"Therefore the office is indifferent,\n"+
		"Being entreated to it by your friend.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"You have prevail'd, my lord; if I can do it\n"+
		"By ought that I can speak in his dispraise,\n"+
		"She shall not long continue love to him.\n"+
		"But say this weed her love from Valentine,\n"+
		"It follows not that she will love Sir Thurio.\n"+
		"THURIO\n"+
		"Therefore, as you unwind her love from him,\n"+
		"Lest it should ravel and be good to none,\n"+
		"You must provide to bottom it on me;\n"+
		"Which must be done by praising me as much\n"+
		"As you in worth dispraise Sir Valentine.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"And, Proteus, we dare trust you in this kind,\n"+
		"Because we know, on Valentine's report,\n"+
		"You are already Love's firm votary\n"+
		"And cannot soon revolt and change your mind.\n"+
		"Upon this warrant shall you have access\n"+
		"Where you with Silvia may confer at large;\n"+
		"For she is lumpish, heavy, melancholy,\n"+
		"And, for your friend's sake, will be glad of you;\n"+
		"Where you may temper her by your persuasion\n"+
		"To hate young Valentine and love my friend.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"As much as I can do, I will effect:\n"+
		"But you, Sir Thurio, are not sharp enough;\n"+
		"You must lay lime to tangle her desires\n"+
		"By wailful sonnets, whose composed rhymes\n"+
		"Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"Ay,\n"+
		"Much is the force of heaven-bred poesy.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Say that upon the altar of her beauty\n"+
		"You sacrifice your tears, your sighs, your heart:\n"+
		"Write till your ink be dry, and with your tears\n"+
		"Moist it again, and frame some feeling line\n"+
		"That may discover such integrity:\n"+
		"For Orpheus' lute was strung with poets' sinews,\n"+
		"Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones,\n"+
		"Make tigers tame and huge leviathans\n"+
		"Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands.\n"+
		"After your dire-lamenting elegies,\n"+
		"Visit by night your lady's chamber-window\n"+
		"With some sweet concert; to their instruments\n"+
		"Tune a deploring dump: the night's dead silence\n"+
		"Will well become such sweet-complaining grievance.\n"+
		"This, or else nothing, will inherit her.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"This discipline shows thou hast been in love.\n"+
		"THURIO\n"+
		"And thy advice this night I'll put in practise.\n"+
		"Therefore, sweet Proteus, my direction-giver,\n"+
		"Let us into the city presently\n"+
		"To sort some gentlemen well skill'd in music.\n"+
		"I have a sonnet that will serve the turn\n"+
		"To give the onset to thy good advice.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"About it, gentlemen!\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"We'll wait upon your grace till after supper,\n"+
		"And afterward determine our proceedings.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"Even now about it! I will pardon you.\n"+

		"First Outlaw\n"+
		"Fellows, stand fast; I see a passenger.\n"+
		"Second Outlaw\n"+
		"If there be ten, shrink not, but down with 'em.\n"+

		"Third Outlaw\n"+
		"Stand, sir, and throw us that you have about ye:\n"+
		"If not: we'll make you sit and rifle you.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"Sir, we are undone; these are the villains\n"+
		"That all the travellers do fear so much.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"My friends,--\n"+
		"First Outlaw\n"+
		"That's not so, sir: we are your enemies.\n"+
		"Second Outlaw\n"+
		"Peace! we'll hear him.\n"+
		"Third Outlaw\n"+
		"Ay, by my beard, will we, for he's a proper man.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Then know that I have little wealth to lose:\n"+
		"A man I am cross'd with adversity;\n"+
		"My riches are these poor habiliments,\n"+
		"Of which if you should here disfurnish me,\n"+
		"You take the sum and substance that I have.\n"+
		"Second Outlaw\n"+
		"Whither travel you?\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"To Verona.\n"+
		"First Outlaw\n"+
		"Whence came you?\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"From Milan.\n"+
		"Third Outlaw\n"+
		"Have you long sojourned there?\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Some sixteen months, and longer might have stay'd,\n"+
		"If crooked fortune had not thwarted me.\n"+
		"First Outlaw\n"+
		"What, were you banish'd thence?\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"I was.\n"+
		"Second Outlaw\n"+
		"For what offence?\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"For that which now torments me to rehearse:\n"+
		"I kill'd a man, whose death I much repent;\n"+
		"Bu t yet I slew him manfully in fight,\n"+
		"Without false vantage or base treachery.\n"+
		"First Outlaw\n"+
		"Why, ne'er repent it, if it were done so.\n"+
		"But were you banish'd for so small a fault?\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"I was, and held me glad of such a doom.\n"+
		"Second Outlaw\n"+
		"Have you the tongues?\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"My youthful travel therein made me happy,\n"+
		"Or else I often had been miserable.\n"+
		"Third Outlaw\n"+
		"By the bare scalp of Robin Hood's fat friar,\n"+
		"This fellow were a king for our wild faction!\n"+
		"First Outlaw\n"+
		"We'll have him. Sirs, a word.\n"+
		"SPEED\n"+
		"Master, be one of them; it's an honourable kind of thievery.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Peace, villain!\n"+
		"Second Outlaw\n"+
		"Tell us this: have you any thing to take to?\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Nothing but my fortune.\n"+
		"Third Outlaw\n"+
		"Know, then, that some of us are gentlemen,\n"+
		"Such as the fury of ungovern'd youth\n"+
		"Thrust from the company of awful men:\n"+
		"Myself was from Verona banished\n"+
		"For practising to steal away a lady,\n"+
		"An heir, and near allied unto the duke.\n"+
		"Second Outlaw\n"+
		"And I from Mantua, for a gentleman,\n"+
		"Who, in my mood, I stabb'd unto the heart.\n"+
		"First Outlaw\n"+
		"And I for such like petty crimes as these,\n"+
		"But to the purpose--for we cite our faults,\n"+
		"That they may hold excus'd our lawless lives;\n"+
		"And partly, seeing you are beautified\n"+
		"With goodly shape and by your own report\n"+
		"A linguist and a man of such perfection\n"+
		"As we do in our quality much want--\n"+
		"Second Outlaw\n"+
		"Indeed, because you are a banish'd man,\n"+
		"Therefore, above the rest, we parley to you:\n"+
		"Are you content to be our general?\n"+
		"To make a virtue of necessity\n"+
		"And live, as we do, in this wilderness?\n"+
		"Third Outlaw\n"+
		"What say'st thou? wilt thou be of our consort?\n"+
		"Say ay, and be the captain of us all:\n"+
		"We'll do thee homage and be ruled by thee,\n"+
		"Love thee as our commander and our king.\n"+
		"First Outlaw\n"+
		"But if thou scorn our courtesy, thou diest.\n"+
		"Second Outlaw\n"+
		"Thou shalt not live to brag what we have offer'd.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"I take your offer and will live with you,\n"+
		"Provided that you do no outrages\n"+
		"On silly women or poor passengers.\n"+
		"Third Outlaw\n"+
		"No, we detest such vile base practises.\n"+
		"Come, go with us, we'll bring thee to our crews,\n"+
		"And show thee all the treasure we have got,\n"+
		"Which, with ourselves, all rest at thy dispose.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. Milan. Outside the DUKE's palace, under SILVIA's chamber.\n"+
		"Enter PROTEUS\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Already have I been false to Valentine\n"+
		"And now I must be as unjust to Thurio.\n"+
		"Under the colour of commending him,\n"+
		"I have access my own love to prefer:\n"+
		"But Silvia is too fair, too true, too holy,\n"+
		"To be corrupted with my worthless gifts.\n"+
		"When I protest true loyalty to her,\n"+
		"She twits me with my falsehood to my friend;\n"+
		"When to her beauty I commend my vows,\n"+
		"She bids me think how I have been forsworn\n"+
		"In breaking faith with Julia whom I loved:\n"+
		"And notwithstanding all her sudden quips,\n"+
		"The least whereof would quell a lover's hope,\n"+
		"Yet, spaniel-like, the more she spurns my love,\n"+
		"The more it grows and fawneth on her still.\n"+
		"But here comes Thurio: now must we to her window,\n"+
		"And give some evening music to her ear.\n"+
		"Enter THURIO and Musicians\n"+
		"THURIO\n"+
		"How now, Sir Proteus, are you crept before us?\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Ay, gentle Thurio: for you know that love\n"+
		"Will creep in service where it cannot go.\n"+
		"THURIO\n"+
		"Ay, but I hope, sir, that you love not here.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Sir, but I do; or else I would be hence.\n"+
		"THURIO\n"+
		"Who? Silvia?\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Ay, Silvia; for your sake.\n"+
		"THURIO\n"+
		"I thank you for your own. Now, gentlemen,\n"+
		"Let's tune, and to it lustily awhile.\n"+
		"Enter, at a distance, Host, and JULIA in boy's clothes\n"+
		"Host\n"+
		"Now, my young guest, methinks you're allycholly: I\n"+
		"pray you, why is it?\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"Marry, mine host, because I cannot be merry.\n"+
		"Host\n"+
		"Come, we'll have you merry: I'll bring you where\n"+
		"you shall hear music and see the gentleman that you asked for.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"But shall I hear him speak?\n"+
		"Host\n"+
		"Ay, that you shall.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"That will be music.\n"+
		"Music plays\n"+
		"Host\n"+
		"Hark, hark!\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"Is he among these?\n"+
		"Host\n"+
		"Ay: but, peace! let's hear 'em.\n"+
		"SONG.\n"+
		"Who is Silvia? what is she,\n"+
		"That all our swains commend her?\n"+
		"Holy, fair and wise is she;\n"+
		"The heaven such grace did lend her,\n"+
		"That she might admired be.\n"+
		"Is she kind as she is fair?\n"+
		"For beauty lives with kindness.\n"+
		"Love doth to her eyes repair,\n"+
		"To help him of his blindness,\n"+
		"And, being help'd, inhabits there.\n"+
		"Then to Silvia let us sing,\n"+
		"That Silvia is excelling;\n"+
		"She excels each mortal thing\n"+
		"Upon the dull earth dwelling:\n"+
		"To her let us garlands bring.\n"+
		"Host\n"+
		"How now! are you sadder than you were before? How\n"+
		"do you, man? the music likes you not.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"You mistake; the musician likes me not.\n"+
		"Host\n"+
		"Why, my pretty youth?\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"He plays false, father.\n"+
		"Host\n"+
		"How? out of tune on the strings?\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"Not so; but yet so false that he grieves my very\n"+
		"heart-strings.\n"+
		"Host\n"+
		"You have a quick ear.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"Ay, I would I were deaf; it makes me have a slow heart.\n"+
		"Host\n"+
		"I perceive you delight not in music.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"Not a whit, when it jars so.\n"+
		"Host\n"+
		"Hark, what fine change is in the music!\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"Ay, that change is the spite.\n"+
		"Host\n"+
		"You would have them always play but one thing?\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"I would always have one play but one thing.\n"+
		"But, host, doth this Sir Proteus that we talk on\n"+
		"Often resort unto this gentlewoman?\n"+
		"Host\n"+
		"I tell you what Launce, his man, told me: he loved\n"+
		"her out of all nick.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"Where is Launce?\n"+
		"Host\n"+
		"Gone to seek his dog; which tomorrow, by his\n"+
		"master's command, he must carry for a present to his lady.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"Peace! stand aside: the company parts.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Sir Thurio, fear not you: I will so plead\n"+
		"That you shall say my cunning drift excels.\n"+
		"THURIO\n"+
		"Where meet we?\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"At Saint Gregory's well.\n"+
		"THURIO\n"+
		"Farewell.\n"+
		"Exeunt THURIO and Musicians\n"+
		"Enter SILVIA above\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Madam, good even to your ladyship.\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"I thank you for your music, gentlemen.\n"+
		"Who is that that spake?\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"One, lady, if you knew his pure heart's truth,\n"+
		"You would quickly learn to know him by his voice.\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"Sir Proteus, as I take it.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Sir Proteus, gentle lady, and your servant.\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"What's your will?\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"That I may compass yours.\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"You have your wish; my will is even this:\n"+
		"That presently you hie you home to bed.\n"+
		"Thou subtle, perjured, false, disloyal man!\n"+
		"Think'st thou I am so shallow, so conceitless,\n"+
		"To be seduced by thy flattery,\n"+
		"That hast deceived so many with thy vows?\n"+
		"Return, return, and make thy love amends.\n"+
		"For me, by this pale queen of night I swear,\n"+
		"I am so far from granting thy request\n"+
		"That I despise thee for thy wrongful suit,\n"+
		"And by and by intend to chide myself\n"+
		"Even for this time I spend in talking to thee.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"I grant, sweet love, that I did love a lady;\n"+
		"But she is dead.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"[Aside] 'Twere false, if I should speak it;\n"+
		"For I am sure she is not buried.\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"Say that she be; yet Valentine thy friend\n"+
		"Survives; to whom, thyself art witness,\n"+
		"I am betroth'd: and art thou not ashamed\n"+
		"To wrong him with thy importunacy?\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"I likewise hear that Valentine is dead.\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"And so suppose am I; for in his grave\n"+
		"Assure thyself my love is buried.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Sweet lady, let me rake it from the earth.\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"Go to thy lady's grave and call hers thence,\n"+
		"Or, at the least, in hers sepulchre thine.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"[Aside] He heard not that.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Madam, if your heart be so obdurate,\n"+
		"Vouchsafe me yet your picture for my love,\n"+
		"The picture that is hanging in your chamber;\n"+
		"To that I'll speak, to that I'll sigh and weep:\n"+
		"For since the substance of your perfect self\n"+
		"Is else devoted, I am but a shadow;\n"+
		"And to your shadow will I make true love.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"[Aside] If 'twere a substance, you would, sure,\n"+
		"deceive it,\n"+
		"And make it but a shadow, as I am.\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"I am very loath to be your idol, sir;\n"+
		"But since your falsehood shall become you well\n"+
		"To worship shadows and adore false shapes,\n"+
		"Send to me in the morning and I'll send it:\n"+
		"And so, good rest.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"As wretches have o'ernight\n"+
		"That wait for execution in the morn.\n"+
		"Exeunt PROTEUS and SILVIA severally\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"Host, will you go?\n"+
		"Host\n"+
		"By my halidom, I was fast asleep.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"Pray you, where lies Sir Proteus?\n"+
		"Host\n"+
		"Marry, at my house. Trust me, I think 'tis almost\n"+
		"day.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"Not so; but it hath been the longest night\n"+
		"That e'er I watch'd and the most heaviest.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. The same.\n"+
		"Enter EGLAMOUR\n"+
		"EGLAMOUR\n"+
		"This is the hour that Madam Silvia\n"+
		"Entreated me to call and know her mind:\n"+
		"There's some great matter she'ld employ me in.\n"+
		"Madam, madam!\n"+
		"Enter SILVIA above\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"Who calls?\n"+
		"EGLAMOUR\n"+
		"Your servant and your friend;\n"+
		"One that attends your ladyship's command.\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"Sir Eglamour, a thousand times good morrow.\n"+
		"EGLAMOUR\n"+
		"As many, worthy lady, to yourself:\n"+
		"According to your ladyship's impose,\n"+
		"I am thus early come to know what service\n"+
		"It is your pleasure to command me in.\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"O Eglamour, thou art a gentleman--\n"+
		"Think not I flatter, for I swear I do not--\n"+
		"Valiant, wise, remorseful, well accomplish'd:\n"+
		"Thou art not ignorant what dear good will\n"+
		"I bear unto the banish'd Valentine,\n"+
		"Nor how my father would enforce me marry\n"+
		"Vain Thurio, whom my very soul abhors.\n"+
		"Thyself hast loved; and I have heard thee say\n"+
		"No grief did ever come so near thy heart\n"+
		"As when thy lady and thy true love died,\n"+
		"Upon whose grave thou vow'dst pure chastity.\n"+
		"Sir Eglamour, I would to Valentine,\n"+
		"To Mantua, where I hear he makes abode;\n"+
		"And, for the ways are dangerous to pass,\n"+
		"I do desire thy worthy company,\n"+
		"Upon whose faith and honour I repose.\n"+
		"Urge not my father's anger, Eglamour,\n"+
		"But think upon my grief, a lady's grief,\n"+
		"And on the justice of my flying hence,\n"+
		"To keep me from a most unholy match,\n"+
		"Which heaven and fortune still rewards with plagues.\n"+
		"I do desire thee, even from a heart\n"+
		"As full of sorrows as the sea of sands,\n"+
		"To bear me company and go with me:\n"+
		"If not, to hide what I have said to thee,\n"+
		"That I may venture to depart alone.\n"+
		"EGLAMOUR\n"+
		"Madam, I pity much your grievances;\n"+
		"Which since I know they virtuously are placed,\n"+
		"I give consent to go along with you,\n"+
		"Recking as little what betideth me\n"+
		"As much I wish all good befortune you.\n"+
		"When will you go?\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"This evening coming.\n"+
		"EGLAMOUR\n"+
		"Where shall I meet you?\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"At Friar Patrick's cell,\n"+
		"Where I intend holy confession.\n"+
		"EGLAMOUR\n"+
		"I will not fail your ladyship. Good morrow, gentle lady.\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"Good morrow, kind Sir Eglamour.\n"+
		"Exeunt severally\n"+
		"SCENE IV. The same.\n"+
		"Enter LAUNCE, with his his Dog\n"+
		"LAUNCE\n"+
		"When a man's servant shall play the cur with him,\n"+
		"look you, it goes hard: one that I brought up of a\n"+
		"puppy; one that I saved from drowning, when three or\n"+
		"four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it.\n"+
		"I have taught him, even as one would say precisely,\n"+
		"'thus I would teach a dog.' I was sent to deliver\n"+
		"him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master;\n"+
		"and I came no sooner into the dining-chamber but he\n"+
		"steps me to her trencher and steals her capon's leg:\n"+
		"O, 'tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself\n"+
		"in all companies! I would have, as one should say,\n"+
		"one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be,\n"+
		"as it were, a dog at all things. If I had not had\n"+
		"more wit than he, to take a fault upon me that he did,\n"+
		"I think verily he had been hanged for't; sure as I\n"+
		"live, he had suffered for't; you shall judge. He\n"+
		"thrusts me himself into the company of three or four\n"+
		"gentlemanlike dogs under the duke's table: he had\n"+
		"not been there--bless the mark!--a pissing while, but\n"+
		"all the chamber smelt him. 'Out with the dog!' says\n"+
		"one: 'What cur is that?' says another: 'Whip him\n"+
		"out' says the third: 'Hang him up' says the duke.\n"+
		"I, having been acquainted with the smell before,\n"+
		"knew it was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that\n"+
		"whips the dogs: 'Friend,' quoth I, 'you mean to whip\n"+
		"the dog?' 'Ay, marry, do I,' quoth he. 'You do him\n"+
		"the more wrong,' quoth I; ''twas I did the thing you\n"+
		"wot of.' He makes me no more ado, but whips me out\n"+
		"of the chamber. How many masters would do this for\n"+
		"his servant? Nay, I'll be sworn, I have sat in the\n"+
		"stocks for puddings he hath stolen, otherwise he had\n"+
		"been executed; I have stood on the pillory for geese\n"+
		"he hath killed, otherwise he had suffered for't.\n"+
		"Thou thinkest not of this now. Nay, I remember the\n"+
		"trick you served me when I took my leave of Madam\n"+
		"Silvia: did not I bid thee still mark me and do as I\n"+
		"do? when didst thou see me heave up my leg and make\n"+
		"water against a gentlewoman's farthingale? didst\n"+
		"thou ever see me do such a trick?\n"+
		"Enter PROTEUS and JULIA\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Sebastian is thy name? I like thee well\n"+
		"And will employ thee in some service presently.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"In what you please: I'll do what I can.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"I hope thou wilt.\n"+
		"To LAUNCE\n"+
		"How now, you whoreson peasant!\n"+
		"Where have you been these two days loitering?\n"+
		"LAUNCE\n"+
		"Marry, sir, I carried Mistress Silvia the dog you bade me.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"And what says she to my little jewel?\n"+
		"LAUNCE\n"+
		"Marry, she says your dog was a cur, and tells you\n"+
		"currish thanks is good enough for such a present.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"But she received my dog?\n"+
		"LAUNCE\n"+
		"No, indeed, did she not: here have I brought him\n"+
		"back again.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"What, didst thou offer her this from me?\n"+
		"LAUNCE\n"+
		"Ay, sir: the other squirrel was stolen from me by\n"+
		"the hangman boys in the market-place: and then I\n"+
		"offered her mine own, who is a dog as big as ten of\n"+
		"yours, and therefore the gift the greater.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Go get thee hence, and find my dog again,\n"+
		"Or ne'er return again into my sight.\n"+
		"Away, I say! stay'st thou to vex me here?\n"+
		"Exit LAUNCE\n"+
		"A slave, that still an end turns me to shame!\n"+
		"Sebastian, I have entertained thee,\n"+
		"Partly that I have need of such a youth\n"+
		"That can with some discretion do my business,\n"+
		"For 'tis no trusting to yond foolish lout,\n"+
		"But chiefly for thy face and thy behavior,\n"+
		"Which, if my augury deceive me not,\n"+
		"Witness good bringing up, fortune and truth:\n"+
		"Therefore know thou, for this I entertain thee.\n"+
		"Go presently and take this ring with thee,\n"+
		"Deliver it to Madam Silvia:\n"+
		"She loved me well deliver'd it to me.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"It seems you loved not her, to leave her token.\n"+
		"She is dead, belike?\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Not so; I think she lives.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"Alas!\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Why dost thou cry 'alas'?\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"I cannot choose\n"+
		"But pity her.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Wherefore shouldst thou pity her?\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"Because methinks that she loved you as well\n"+
		"As you do love your lady Silvia:\n"+
		"She dreams of him that has forgot her love;\n"+
		"You dote on her that cares not for your love.\n"+
		"'Tis pity love should be so contrary;\n"+
		"And thinking of it makes me cry 'alas!'\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Well, give her that ring and therewithal\n"+
		"This letter. That's her chamber. Tell my lady\n"+
		"I claim the promise for her heavenly picture.\n"+
		"Your message done, hie home unto my chamber,\n"+
		"Where thou shalt find me, sad and solitary.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"How many women would do such a message?\n"+
		"Alas, poor Proteus! thou hast entertain'd\n"+
		"A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.\n"+
		"Alas, poor fool! why do I pity him\n"+
		"That with his very heart despiseth me?\n"+
		"Because he loves her, he despiseth me;\n"+
		"Because I love him I must pity him.\n"+
		"This ring I gave him when he parted from me,\n"+
		"To bind him to remember my good will;\n"+
		"And now am I, unhappy messenger,\n"+
		"To plead for that which I would not obtain,\n"+
		"To carry that which I would have refused,\n"+
		"To praise his faith which I would have dispraised.\n"+
		"I am my master's true-confirmed love;\n"+
		"But cannot be true servant to my master,\n"+
		"Unless I prove false traitor to myself.\n"+
		"Yet will I woo for him, but yet so coldly\n"+
		"As, heaven it knows, I would not have him speed.\n"+
		"Enter SILVIA, attended\n"+
		"Gentlewoman, good day! I pray you, be my mean\n"+
		"To bring me where to speak with Madam Silvia.\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"What would you with her, if that I be she?\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"If you be she, I do entreat your patience\n"+
		"To hear me speak the message I am sent on.\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"From whom?\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"From my master, Sir Proteus, madam.\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"O, he sends you for a picture.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"Ay, madam.\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"Ursula, bring my picture here.\n"+
		"Go give your master this: tell him from me,\n"+
		"One Julia, that his changing thoughts forget,\n"+
		"Would better fit his chamber than this shadow.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"Madam, please you peruse this letter.--\n"+
		"Pardon me, madam; I have unadvised\n"+
		"Deliver'd you a paper that I should not:\n"+
		"This is the letter to your ladyship.\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"I pray thee, let me look on that again.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"It may not be; good madam, pardon me.\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"There, hold!\n"+
		"I will not look upon your master's lines:\n"+
		"I know they are stuff'd with protestations\n"+
		"And full of new-found oaths; which he will break\n"+
		"As easily as I do tear his paper.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"Madam, he sends your ladyship this ring.\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"The more shame for him that he sends it me;\n"+
		"For I have heard him say a thousand times\n"+
		"His Julia gave it him at his departure.\n"+
		"Though his false finger have profaned the ring,\n"+
		"Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"She thanks you.\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"What say'st thou?\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"I thank you, madam, that you tender her.\n"+
		"Poor gentlewoman! my master wrongs her much.\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"Dost thou know her?\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"Almost as well as I do know myself:\n"+
		"To think upon her woes I do protest\n"+
		"That I have wept a hundred several times.\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"I think she doth; and that's her cause of sorrow.\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"Is she not passing fair?\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"She hath been fairer, madam, than she is:\n"+
		"When she did think my master loved her well,\n"+
		"She, in my judgment, was as fair as you:\n"+
		"But since she did neglect her looking-glass\n"+
		"And threw her sun-expelling mask away,\n"+
		"The air hath starved the roses in her cheeks\n"+
		"And pinch'd the lily-tincture of her face,\n"+
		"That now she is become as black as I.\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"How tall was she?\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"About my stature; for at Pentecost,\n"+
		"When all our pageants of delight were play'd,\n"+
		"Our youth got me to play the woman's part,\n"+
		"And I was trimm'd in Madam Julia's gown,\n"+
		"Which served me as fit, by all men's judgments,\n"+
		"As if the garment had been made for me:\n"+
		"Therefore I know she is about my height.\n"+
		"And at that time I made her weep agood,\n"+
		"For I did play a lamentable part:\n"+
		"Madam, 'twas Ariadne passioning\n"+
		"For Theseus' perjury and unjust flight;\n"+
		"Which I so lively acted with my tears\n"+
		"That my poor mistress, moved therewithal,\n"+
		"Wept bitterly; and would I might be dead\n"+
		"If I in thought felt not her very sorrow!\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"She is beholding to thee, gentle youth.\n"+
		"Alas, poor lady, desolate and left!\n"+
		"I weep myself to think upon thy words.\n"+
		"Here, youth, there is my purse; I give thee this\n"+
		"For thy sweet mistress' sake, because thou lovest her.\n"+
		"Farewell.\n"+
		"Exit SILVIA, with attendants\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"And she shall thank you for't, if e'er you know her.\n"+
		"A virtuous gentlewoman, mild and beautiful\n"+
		"I hope my master's suit will be but cold,\n"+
		"Since she respects my mistress' love so much.\n"+
		"Alas, how love can trifle with itself!\n"+
		"Here is her picture: let me see; I think,\n"+
		"If I had such a tire, this face of mine\n"+
		"Were full as lovely as is this of hers:\n"+
		"And yet the painter flatter'd her a little,\n"+
		"Unless I flatter with myself too much.\n"+
		"Her hair is auburn, mine is perfect yellow:\n"+
		"If that be all the difference in his love,\n"+
		"I'll get me such a colour'd periwig.\n"+
		"Her eyes are grey as glass, and so are mine:\n"+
		"Ay, but her forehead's low, and mine's as high.\n"+
		"What should it be that he respects in her\n"+
		"But I can make respective in myself,\n"+
		"If this fond Love were not a blinded god?\n"+
		"Come, shadow, come and take this shadow up,\n"+
		"For 'tis thy rival. O thou senseless form,\n"+
		"Thou shalt be worshipp'd, kiss'd, loved and adored!\n"+
		"And, were there sense in his idolatry,\n"+
		"My substance should be statue in thy stead.\n"+
		"I'll use thee kindly for thy mistress' sake,\n"+
		"That used me so; or else, by Jove I vow,\n"+
		"I should have scratch'd out your unseeing eyes\n"+
		"To make my master out of love with thee!\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"ACT V\n"+
		"SCENE I. Milan. An abbey.\n"+
		"Enter EGLAMOUR\n"+
		"EGLAMOUR\n"+
		"The sun begins to gild the western sky;\n"+
		"And now it is about the very hour\n"+
		"That Silvia, at Friar Patrick's cell, should meet me.\n"+
		"She will not fail, for lovers break not hours,\n"+
		"Unless it be to come before their time;\n"+
		"So much they spur their expedition.\n"+
		"See where she comes.\n"+
		"Enter SILVIA\n"+
		"Lady, a happy evening!\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"Amen, amen! Go on, good Eglamour,\n"+
		"Out at the postern by the abbey-wall:\n"+
		"I fear I am attended by some spies.\n"+
		"EGLAMOUR\n"+
		"Fear not: the forest is not three leagues off;\n"+
		"If we recover that, we are sure enough.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. The same. The DUKE's palace.\n"+
		"Enter THURIO, PROTEUS, and JULIA\n"+
		"THURIO\n"+
		"Sir Proteus, what says Silvia to my suit?\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"O, sir, I find her milder than she was;\n"+
		"And yet she takes exceptions at your person.\n"+
		"THURIO\n"+
		"What, that my leg is too long?\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"No; that it is too little.\n"+
		"THURIO\n"+
		"I'll wear a boot, to make it somewhat rounder.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"[Aside] But love will not be spurr'd to what\n"+
		"it loathes.\n"+
		"THURIO\n"+
		"What says she to my face?\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"She says it is a fair one.\n"+
		"THURIO\n"+
		"Nay then, the wanton lies; my face is black.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"But pearls are fair; and the old saying is,\n"+
		"Black men are pearls in beauteous ladies' eyes.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"[Aside] 'Tis true; such pearls as put out\n"+
		"ladies' eyes;\n"+
		"For I had rather wink than look on them.\n"+
		"THURIO\n"+
		"How likes she my discourse?\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Ill, when you talk of war.\n"+
		"THURIO\n"+
		"But well, when I discourse of love and peace?\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"[Aside] But better, indeed, when you hold your peace.\n"+
		"THURIO\n"+
		"What says she to my valour?\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"O, sir, she makes no doubt of that.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"[Aside] She needs not, when she knows it cowardice.\n"+
		"THURIO\n"+
		"What says she to my birth?\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"That you are well derived.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"[Aside] True; from a gentleman to a fool.\n"+
		"THURIO\n"+
		"Considers she my possessions?\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"O, ay; and pities them.\n"+
		"THURIO\n"+
		"Wherefore?\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"[Aside] That such an ass should owe them.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"That they are out by lease.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"Here comes the duke.\n"+
		"Enter DUKE\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"How now, Sir Proteus! how now, Thurio!\n"+
		"Which of you saw Sir Eglamour of late?\n"+
		"THURIO\n"+
		"Not I.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Nor I.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"Saw you my daughter?\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Neither.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"Why then,\n"+
		"She's fled unto that peasant Valentine;\n"+
		"And Eglamour is in her company.\n"+
		"'Tis true; for Friar Laurence met them both,\n"+
		"As he in penance wander'd through the forest;\n"+
		"Him he knew well, and guess'd that it was she,\n"+
		"But, being mask'd, he was not sure of it;\n"+
		"Besides, she did intend confession\n"+
		"At Patrick's cell this even; and there she was not;\n"+
		"These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence.\n"+
		"Therefore, I pray you, stand not to discourse,\n"+
		"But mount you presently and meet with me\n"+
		"Upon the rising of the mountain-foot\n"+
		"That leads towards Mantua, whither they are fled:\n"+
		"Dispatch, sweet gentlemen, and follow me.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"THURIO\n"+
		"Why, this it is to be a peevish girl,\n"+
		"That flies her fortune when it follows her.\n"+
		"I'll after, more to be revenged on Eglamour\n"+
		"Than for the love of reckless Silvia.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"And I will follow, more for Silvia's love\n"+
		"Than hate of Eglamour that goes with her.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"And I will follow, more to cross that love\n"+
		"Than hate for Silvia that is gone for love.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE III. The frontiers of Mantua. The forest.\n"+
		"Enter Outlaws with SILVIA\n"+
		"First Outlaw\n"+
		"Come, come,\n"+
		"Be patient; we must bring you to our captain.\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"A thousand more mischances than this one\n"+
		"Have learn'd me how to brook this patiently.\n"+
		"Second Outlaw\n"+
		"Come, bring her away.\n"+
		"First Outlaw\n"+
		"Where is the gentleman that was with her?\n"+
		"Third Outlaw\n"+
		"Being nimble-footed, he hath outrun us,\n"+
		"But Moyses and Valerius follow him.\n"+
		"Go thou with her to the west end of the wood;\n"+
		"There is our captain: we'll follow him that's fled;\n"+
		"The thicket is beset; he cannot 'scape.\n"+
		"First Outlaw\n"+
		"Come, I must bring you to our captain's cave:\n"+
		"Fear not; he bears an honourable mind,\n"+
		"And will not use a woman lawlessly.\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"O Valentine, this I endure for thee!\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV. Another part of the forest.\n"+
		"Enter VALENTINE\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"How use doth breed a habit in a man!\n"+
		"This shadowy desert, unfrequented woods,\n"+
		"I better brook than flourishing peopled towns:\n"+
		"Here can I sit alone, unseen of any,\n"+
		"And to the nightingale's complaining notes\n"+
		"Tune my distresses and record my woes.\n"+
		"O thou that dost inhabit in my breast,\n"+
		"Leave not the mansion so long tenantless,\n"+
		"Lest, growing ruinous, the building fall\n"+
		"And leave no memory of what it was!\n"+
		"Repair me with thy presence, Silvia;\n"+
		"Thou gentle nymph, cherish thy forlorn swain!\n"+
		"What halloing and what stir is this to-day?\n"+
		"These are my mates, that make their wills their law,\n"+
		"Have some unhappy passenger in chase.\n"+
		"They love me well; yet I have much to do\n"+
		"To keep them from uncivil outrages.\n"+
		"Withdraw thee, Valentine: who's this comes here?\n"+
		"Enter PROTEUS, SILVIA, and JULIA\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Madam, this service I have done for you,\n"+
		"Though you respect not aught your servant doth,\n"+
		"To hazard life and rescue you from him\n"+
		"That would have forced your honour and your love;\n"+
		"Vouchsafe me, for my meed, but one fair look;\n"+
		"A smaller boon than this I cannot beg\n"+
		"And less than this, I am sure, you cannot give.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"[Aside] How like a dream is this I see and hear!\n"+
		"Love, lend me patience to forbear awhile.\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"O miserable, unhappy that I am!\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Unhappy were you, madam, ere I came;\n"+
		"But by my coming I have made you happy.\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"By thy approach thou makest me most unhappy.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"[Aside] And me, when he approacheth to your presence.\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"Had I been seized by a hungry lion,\n"+
		"I would have been a breakfast to the beast,\n"+
		"Rather than have false Proteus rescue me.\n"+
		"O, Heaven be judge how I love Valentine,\n"+
		"Whose life's as tender to me as my soul!\n"+
		"And full as much, for more there cannot be,\n"+
		"I do detest false perjured Proteus.\n"+
		"Therefore be gone; solicit me no more.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"What dangerous action, stood it next to death,\n"+
		"Would I not undergo for one calm look!\n"+
		"O, 'tis the curse in love, and still approved,\n"+
		"When women cannot love where they're beloved!\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"When Proteus cannot love where he's beloved.\n"+
		"Read over Julia's heart, thy first best love,\n"+
		"For whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith\n"+
		"Into a thousand oaths; and all those oaths\n"+
		"Descended into perjury, to love me.\n"+
		"Thou hast no faith left now, unless thou'dst two;\n"+
		"And that's far worse than none; better have none\n"+
		"Than plural faith which is too much by one:\n"+
		"Thou counterfeit to thy true friend!\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"In love\n"+
		"Who respects friend?\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"All men but Proteus.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Nay, if the gentle spirit of moving words\n"+
		"Can no way change you to a milder form,\n"+
		"I'll woo you like a soldier, at arms' end,\n"+
		"And love you 'gainst the nature of love,--force ye.\n"+
		"SILVIA\n"+
		"O heaven!\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"I'll force thee yield to my desire.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Ruffian, let go that rude uncivil touch,\n"+
		"Thou friend of an ill fashion!\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Valentine!\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Thou common friend, that's without faith or love,\n"+
		"For such is a friend now; treacherous man!\n"+
		"Thou hast beguiled my hopes; nought but mine eye\n"+
		"Could have persuaded me: now I dare not say\n"+
		"I have one friend alive; thou wouldst disprove me.\n"+
		"Who should be trusted, when one's own right hand\n"+
		"Is perjured to the bosom? Proteus,\n"+
		"I am sorry I must never trust thee more,\n"+
		"But count the world a stranger for thy sake.\n"+
		"The private wound is deepest: O time most accurst,\n"+
		"'Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst!\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"My shame and guilt confounds me.\n"+
		"Forgive me, Valentine: if hearty sorrow\n"+
		"Be a sufficient ransom for offence,\n"+
		"I tender 't here; I do as truly suffer\n"+
		"As e'er I did commit.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Then I am paid;\n"+
		"And once again I do receive thee honest.\n"+
		"Who by repentance is not satisfied\n"+
		"Is nor of heaven nor earth, for these are pleased.\n"+
		"By penitence the Eternal's wrath's appeased:\n"+
		"And, that my love may appear plain and free,\n"+
		"All that was mine in Silvia I give thee.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"O me unhappy!\n"+
		"Swoons\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Look to the boy.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Why, boy! why, wag! how now! what's the matter?\n"+
		"Look up; speak.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"O good sir, my master charged me to deliver a ring\n"+
		"to Madam Silvia, which, out of my neglect, was never done.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Where is that ring, boy?\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"Here 'tis; this is it.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"How! let me see:\n"+
		"Why, this is the ring I gave to Julia.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook:\n"+
		"This is the ring you sent to Silvia.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"But how camest thou by this ring? At my depart\n"+
		"I gave this unto Julia.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"And Julia herself did give it me;\n"+
		"And Julia herself hath brought it hither.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"How! Julia!\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths,\n"+
		"And entertain'd 'em deeply in her heart.\n"+
		"How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root!\n"+
		"O Proteus, let this habit make thee blush!\n"+
		"Be thou ashamed that I have took upon me\n"+
		"Such an immodest raiment, if shame live\n"+
		"In a disguise of love:\n"+
		"It is the lesser blot, modesty finds,\n"+
		"Women to change their shapes than men their minds.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Than men their minds! 'tis true.\n"+
		"O heaven! were man\n"+
		"But constant, he were perfect. That one error\n"+
		"Fills him with faults; makes him run through all the sins:\n"+
		"Inconstancy falls off ere it begins.\n"+
		"What is in Silvia's face, but I may spy\n"+
		"More fresh in Julia's with a constant eye?\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Come, come, a hand from either:\n"+
		"Let me be blest to make this happy close;\n"+
		"'Twere pity two such friends should be long foes.\n"+
		"PROTEUS\n"+
		"Bear witness, Heaven, I have my wish for ever.\n"+
		"JULIA\n"+
		"And I mine.\n"+
		"Enter Outlaws, with DUKE and THURIO\n"+
		"Outlaws\n"+
		"A prize, a prize, a prize!\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Forbear, forbear, I say! it is my lord the duke.\n"+
		"Your grace is welcome to a man disgraced,\n"+
		"Banished Valentine.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"Sir Valentine!\n"+
		"THURIO\n"+
		"Yonder is Silvia; and Silvia's mine.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Thurio, give back, or else embrace thy death;\n"+
		"Come not within the measure of my wrath;\n"+
		"Do not name Silvia thine; if once again,\n"+
		"Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands;\n"+
		"Take but possession of her with a touch:\n"+
		"I dare thee but to breathe upon my love.\n"+
		"THURIO\n"+
		"Sir Valentine, I care not for her, I;\n"+
		"I hold him but a fool that will endanger\n"+
		"His body for a girl that loves him not:\n"+
		"I claim her not, and therefore she is thine.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"The more degenerate and base art thou,\n"+
		"To make such means for her as thou hast done\n"+
		"And leave her on such slight conditions.\n"+
		"Now, by the honour of my ancestry,\n"+
		"I do applaud thy spirit, Valentine,\n"+
		"And think thee worthy of an empress' love:\n"+
		"Know then, I here forget all former griefs,\n"+
		"Cancel all grudge, repeal thee home again,\n"+
		"Plead a new state in thy unrivall'd merit,\n"+
		"To which I thus subscribe: Sir Valentine,\n"+
		"Thou art a gentleman and well derived;\n"+
		"Take thou thy Silvia, for thou hast deserved her.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"I thank your grace; the gift hath made me happy.\n"+
		"I now beseech you, for your daughter's sake,\n"+
		"To grant one boom that I shall ask of you.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"I grant it, for thine own, whate'er it be.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"These banish'd men that I have kept withal\n"+
		"Are men endued with worthy qualities:\n"+
		"Forgive them what they have committed here\n"+
		"And let them be recall'd from their exile:\n"+
		"They are reformed, civil, full of good\n"+
		"And fit for great employment, worthy lord.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"Thou hast prevail'd; I pardon them and thee:\n"+
		"Dispose of them as thou know'st their deserts.\n"+
		"Come, let us go: we will include all jars\n"+
		"With triumphs, mirth and rare solemnity.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"And, as we walk along, I dare be bold\n"+
		"With our discourse to make your grace to smile.\n"+
		"What think you of this page, my lord?\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"I think the boy hath grace in him; he blushes.\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"I warrant you, my lord, more grace than boy.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"What mean you by that saying?\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"Please you, I'll tell you as we pass along,\n"+
		"That you will wonder what hath fortuned.\n"+
		"Come, Proteus; 'tis your penance but to hear\n"+
		"The story of your loves discovered:\n"+
		"That done, our day of marriage shall be yours;\n"+
		"One feast, one house, one mutual happiness.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"
