		"The Tragedy of Coriolanus\n"+
		"ACT I\n"+
		"SCENE I. Rome. A street.\n"+
		"Enter a company of mutinous Citizens, with staves, clubs, and other weapons\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.\n"+
		"All\n"+
		"Speak, speak.\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?\n"+
		"All\n"+
		"Resolved. resolved.\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people.\n"+
		"All\n"+
		"We know't, we know't.\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own price.\n"+
		"Is't a verdict?\n"+
		"All\n"+
		"No more talking on't; let it be done: away, away!\n"+
		"Second Citizen\n"+
		"One word, good citizens.\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.\n"+
		"What authority surfeits on would relieve us: if they\n"+
		"would yield us but the superfluity, while it were\n"+
		"wholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely;\n"+
		"but they think we are too dear: the leanness that\n"+
		"afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an\n"+
		"inventory to particularise their abundance; our\n"+
		"sufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge this with\n"+
		"our pikes, ere we become rakes: for the gods know I\n"+
		"speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.\n"+
		"Second Citizen\n"+
		"Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius?\n"+
		"All\n"+
		"Against him first: he's a very dog to the commonalty.\n"+
		"Second Citizen\n"+
		"Consider you what services he has done for his country?\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"Very well; and could be content to give him good\n"+
		"report fort, but that he pays himself with being proud.\n"+
		"Second Citizen\n"+
		"Nay, but speak not maliciously.\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"I say unto you, what he hath done famously, he did\n"+
		"it to that end: though soft-conscienced men can be\n"+
		"content to say it was for his country he did it to\n"+
		"please his mother and to be partly proud; which he\n"+
		"is, even till the altitude of his virtue.\n"+
		"Second Citizen\n"+
		"What he cannot help in his nature, you account a\n"+
		"vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations;\n"+
		"he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition.\n"+
		"Shouts within\n"+
		"What shouts are these? The other side o' the city\n"+
		"is risen: why stay we prating here? to the Capitol!\n"+
		"All\n"+
		"Come, come.\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"Soft! who comes here?\n"+
		"Enter MENENIUS AGRIPPA\n"+
		"Second Citizen\n"+
		"Worthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always loved\n"+
		"the people.\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"He's one honest enough: would all the rest were so!\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"What work's, my countrymen, in hand? where go you\n"+
		"With bats and clubs? The matter? speak, I pray you.\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"Our business is not unknown to the senate; they have\n"+
		"had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do,\n"+
		"which now we'll show 'em in deeds. They say poor\n"+
		"suitors have strong breaths: they shall know we\n"+
		"have strong arms too.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours,\n"+
		"Will you undo yourselves?\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"We cannot, sir, we are undone already.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"I tell you, friends, most charitable care\n"+
		"Have the patricians of you. For your wants,\n"+
		"Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well\n"+
		"Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them\n"+
		"Against the Roman state, whose course will on\n"+
		"The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs\n"+
		"Of more strong link asunder than can ever\n"+
		"Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,\n"+
		"The gods, not the patricians, make it, and\n"+
		"Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,\n"+
		"You are transported by calamity\n"+
		"Thither where more attends you, and you slander\n"+
		"The helms o' the state, who care for you like fathers,\n"+
		"When you curse them as enemies.\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"Care for us! True, indeed! They ne'er cared for us\n"+
		"yet: suffer us to famish, and their store-houses\n"+
		"crammed with grain; make edicts for usury, to\n"+
		"support usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act\n"+
		"established against the rich, and provide more\n"+
		"piercing statutes daily, to chain up and restrain\n"+
		"the poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will; and\n"+
		"there's all the love they bear us.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Either you must\n"+
		"Confess yourselves wondrous malicious,\n"+
		"Or be accused of folly. I shall tell you\n"+
		"A pretty tale: it may be you have heard it;\n"+
		"But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture\n"+
		"To stale 't a little more.\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"Well, I'll hear it, sir: yet you must not think to\n"+
		"fob off our disgrace with a tale: but, an 't please\n"+
		"you, deliver.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"There was a time when all the body's members\n"+
		"Rebell'd against the belly, thus accused it:\n"+
		"That only like a gulf it did remain\n"+
		"I' the midst o' the body, idle and unactive,\n"+
		"Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing\n"+
		"Like labour with the rest, where the other instruments\n"+
		"Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,\n"+
		"And, mutually participate, did minister\n"+
		"Unto the appetite and affection common\n"+
		"Of the whole body. The belly answer'd--\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"Well, sir, what answer made the belly?\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,\n"+
		"Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus--\n"+
		"For, look you, I may make the belly smile\n"+
		"As well as speak--it tauntingly replied\n"+
		"To the discontented members, the mutinous parts\n"+
		"That envied his receipt; even so most fitly\n"+
		"As you malign our senators for that\n"+
		"They are not such as you.\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"Your belly's answer? What!\n"+
		"The kingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye,\n"+
		"The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,\n"+
		"Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter.\n"+
		"With other muniments and petty helps\n"+
		"In this our fabric, if that they--\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"What then?\n"+
		"'Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? what then?\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd,\n"+
		"Who is the sink o' the body,--\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Well, what then?\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"The former agents, if they did complain,\n"+
		"What could the belly answer?\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"I will tell you\n"+
		"If you'll bestow a small--of what you have little--\n"+
		"Patience awhile, you'll hear the belly's answer.\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"Ye're long about it.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Note me this, good friend;\n"+
		"Your most grave belly was deliberate,\n"+
		"Not rash like his accusers, and thus answer'd:\n"+
		"'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he,\n"+
		"'That I receive the general food at first,\n"+
		"Which you do live upon; and fit it is,\n"+
		"Because I am the store-house and the shop\n"+
		"Of the whole body: but, if you do remember,\n"+
		"I send it through the rivers of your blood,\n"+
		"Even to the court, the heart, to the seat o' the brain;\n"+
		"And, through the cranks and offices of man,\n"+
		"The strongest nerves and small inferior veins\n"+
		"From me receive that natural competency\n"+
		"Whereby they live: and though that all at once,\n"+
		"You, my good friends,'--this says the belly, mark me,--\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"Ay, sir; well, well.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"'Though all at once cannot\n"+
		"See what I do deliver out to each,\n"+
		"Yet I can make my audit up, that all\n"+
		"From me do back receive the flour of all,\n"+
		"And leave me but the bran.' What say you to't?\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"It was an answer: how apply you this?\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"The senators of Rome are this good belly,\n"+
		"And you the mutinous members; for examine\n"+
		"Their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly\n"+
		"Touching the weal o' the common, you shall find\n"+
		"No public benefit which you receive\n"+
		"But it proceeds or comes from them to you\n"+
		"And no way from yourselves. What do you think,\n"+
		"You, the great toe of this assembly?\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"I the great toe! why the great toe?\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"For that, being one o' the lowest, basest, poorest,\n"+
		"Of this most wise rebellion, thou go'st foremost:\n"+
		"Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,\n"+
		"Lead'st first to win some vantage.\n"+
		"But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs:\n"+
		"Rome and her rats are at the point of battle;\n"+
		"The one side must have bale.\n"+
		"Enter CAIUS MARCIUS\n"+
		"Hail, noble Marcius!\n"+
		"MARCIUS\n"+
		"Thanks. What's the matter, you dissentious rogues,\n"+
		"That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,\n"+
		"Make yourselves scabs?\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"We have ever your good word.\n"+
		"MARCIUS\n"+
		"He that will give good words to thee will flatter\n"+
		"Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,\n"+
		"That like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you,\n"+
		"The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,\n"+
		"Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;\n"+
		"Where foxes, geese: you are no surer, no,\n"+
		"Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,\n"+
		"Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is\n"+
		"To make him worthy whose offence subdues him\n"+
		"And curse that justice did it.\n"+
		"Who deserves greatness\n"+
		"Deserves your hate; and your affections are\n"+
		"A sick man's appetite, who desires most that\n"+
		"Which would increase his evil. He that depends\n"+
		"Upon your favours swims with fins of lead\n"+
		"And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust Ye?\n"+
		"With every minute you do change a mind,\n"+
		"And call him noble that was now your hate,\n"+
		"Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter,\n"+
		"That in these several places of the city\n"+
		"You cry against the noble senate, who,\n"+
		"Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else\n"+
		"Would feed on one another? What's their seeking?\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"For corn at their own rates; whereof, they say,\n"+
		"The city is well stored.\n"+
		"MARCIUS\n"+
		"Hang 'em! They say!\n"+
		"They'll sit by the fire, and presume to know\n"+
		"What's done i' the Capitol; who's like to rise,\n"+
		"Who thrives and who declines; side factions\n"+
		"and give out\n"+
		"Conjectural marriages; making parties strong\n"+
		"And feebling such as stand not in their liking\n"+
		"Below their cobbled shoes. They say there's\n"+
		"grain enough!\n"+
		"Would the nobility lay aside their ruth,\n"+
		"And let me use my sword, I'll make a quarry\n"+
		"With thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high\n"+
		"As I could pick my lance.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;\n"+
		"For though abundantly they lack discretion,\n"+
		"Yet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you,\n"+
		"What says the other troop?\n"+
		"MARCIUS\n"+
		"They are dissolved: hang 'em!\n"+
		"They said they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs,\n"+
		"That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,\n"+
		"That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not\n"+
		"Corn for the rich men only: with these shreds\n"+
		"They vented their complainings; which being answer'd,\n"+
		"And a petition granted them, a strange one--\n"+
		"To break the heart of generosity,\n"+
		"And make bold power look pale--they threw their caps\n"+
		"As they would hang them on the horns o' the moon,\n"+
		"Shouting their emulation.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"What is granted them?\n"+
		"MARCIUS\n"+
		"Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,\n"+
		"Of their own choice: one's Junius Brutus,\n"+
		"Sicinius Velutus, and I know not--'Sdeath!\n"+
		"The rabble should have first unroof'd the city,\n"+
		"Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in time\n"+
		"Win upon power and throw forth greater themes\n"+
		"For insurrection's arguing.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"This is strange.\n"+
		"MARCIUS\n"+
		"Go, get you home, you fragments!\n"+
		"Enter a Messenger, hastily\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Where's Caius Marcius?\n"+
		"MARCIUS\n"+
		"Here: what's the matter?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.\n"+
		"MARCIUS\n"+
		"I am glad on 't: then we shall ha' means to vent\n"+
		"Our musty superfluity. See, our best elders.\n"+
		"Enter COMINIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, and other Senators; JUNIUS BRUTUS and SICINIUS VELUTUS\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"Marcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us;\n"+
		"The Volsces are in arms.\n"+
		"MARCIUS\n"+
		"They have a leader,\n"+
		"Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to 't.\n"+
		"I sin in envying his nobility,\n"+
		"And were I any thing but what I am,\n"+
		"I would wish me only he.\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"You have fought together.\n"+
		"MARCIUS\n"+
		"Were half to half the world by the ears and he.\n"+
		"Upon my party, I'ld revolt to make\n"+
		"Only my wars with him: he is a lion\n"+
		"That I am proud to hunt.\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"Then, worthy Marcius,\n"+
		"Attend upon Cominius to these wars.\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"It is your former promise.\n"+
		"MARCIUS\n"+
		"Sir, it is;\n"+
		"And I am constant. Titus Lartius, thou\n"+
		"Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.\n"+
		"What, art thou stiff? stand'st out?\n"+
		"TITUS\n"+
		"No, Caius Marcius;\n"+
		"I'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other,\n"+
		"Ere stay behind this business.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"O, true-bred!\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"Your company to the Capitol; where, I know,\n"+
		"Our greatest friends attend us.\n"+
		"TITUS\n"+
		"[To COMINIUS] Lead you on.\n"+
		"To MARCIUS\n"+
		"Right worthy you priority.\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"Noble Marcius!\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"[To the Citizens] Hence to your homes; be gone!\n"+
		"MARCIUS\n"+
		"Nay, let them follow:\n"+
		"The Volsces have much corn; take these rats thither\n"+
		"To gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutiners,\n"+
		"Your valour puts well forth: pray, follow.\n"+
		"Citizens steal away. Exeunt all but SICINIUS and BRUTUS\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"He has no equal.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"When we were chosen tribunes for the people,--\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"Mark'd you his lip and eyes?\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Nay. but his taunts.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"Being moved, he will not spare to gird the gods.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Be-mock the modest moon.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"The present wars devour him: he is grown\n"+
		"Too proud to be so valiant.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Such a nature,\n"+
		"Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow\n"+
		"Which he treads on at noon: but I do wonder\n"+
		"His insolence can brook to be commanded\n"+
		"Under Cominius.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"Fame, at the which he aims,\n"+
		"In whom already he's well graced, can not\n"+
		"Better be held nor more attain'd than by\n"+
		"A place below the first: for what miscarries\n"+
		"Shall be the general's fault, though he perform\n"+
		"To the utmost of a man, and giddy censure\n"+
		"Will then cry out of Marcius 'O if he\n"+
		"Had borne the business!'\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Besides, if things go well,\n"+
		"Opinion that so sticks on Marcius shall\n"+
		"Of his demerits rob Cominius.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"Come:\n"+
		"Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius.\n"+
		"Though Marcius earned them not, and all his faults\n"+
		"To Marcius shall be honours, though indeed\n"+
		"In aught he merit not.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Let's hence, and hear\n"+
		"How the dispatch is made, and in what fashion,\n"+
		"More than his singularity, he goes\n"+
		"Upon this present action.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"Lets along.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. Corioli. The Senate-house.\n"+
		"Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS and certain Senators\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"So, your opinion is, Aufidius,\n"+
		"That they of Rome are entered in our counsels\n"+
		"And know how we proceed.\n"+
		"AUFIDIUS\n"+
		"Is it not yours?\n"+
		"What ever have been thought on in this state,\n"+
		"That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome\n"+
		"Had circumvention? 'Tis not four days gone\n"+
		"Since I heard thence; these are the words: I think\n"+
		"I have the letter here; yes, here it is.\n"+
		"Reads\n"+
		"'They have press'd a power, but it is not known\n"+
		"Whether for east or west: the dearth is great;\n"+
		"The people mutinous; and it is rumour'd,\n"+
		"Cominius, Marcius your old enemy,\n"+
		"Who is of Rome worse hated than of you,\n"+
		"And Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman,\n"+
		"These three lead on this preparation\n"+
		"Whither 'tis bent: most likely 'tis for you:\n"+
		"Consider of it.'\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"Our army's in the field\n"+
		"We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready\n"+
		"To answer us.\n"+
		"AUFIDIUS\n"+
		"Nor did you think it folly\n"+
		"To keep your great pretences veil'd till when\n"+
		"They needs must show themselves; which\n"+
		"in the hatching,\n"+
		"It seem'd, appear'd to Rome. By the discovery.\n"+
		"We shall be shorten'd in our aim, which was\n"+
		"To take in many towns ere almost Rome\n"+
		"Should know we were afoot.\n"+
		"Second Senator\n"+
		"Noble Aufidius,\n"+
		"Take your commission; hie you to your bands:\n"+
		"Let us alone to guard Corioli:\n"+
		"If they set down before 's, for the remove\n"+
		"Bring your army; but, I think, you'll find\n"+
		"They've not prepared for us.\n"+
		"AUFIDIUS\n"+
		"O, doubt not that;\n"+
		"I speak from certainties. Nay, more,\n"+
		"Some parcels of their power are forth already,\n"+
		"And only hitherward. I leave your honours.\n"+
		"If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet,\n"+
		"'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike\n"+
		"Till one can do no more.\n"+
		"All\n"+
		"The gods assist you!\n"+
		"AUFIDIUS\n"+
		"And keep your honours safe!\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"Farewell.\n"+
		"Second Senator\n"+
		"Farewell.\n"+
		"All\n"+
		"Farewell.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. Rome. A room in Marcius' house.\n"+
		"Enter VOLUMNIA and VIRGILIA they set them down on two low stools, and sew\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"I pray you, daughter, sing; or express yourself in a\n"+
		"more comfortable sort: if my son were my husband, I\n"+
		"should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he\n"+
		"won honour than in the embracements of his bed where\n"+
		"he would show most love. When yet he was but\n"+
		"tender-bodied and the only son of my womb, when\n"+
		"youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way, when\n"+
		"for a day of kings' entreaties a mother should not\n"+
		"sell him an hour from her beholding, I, considering\n"+
		"how honour would become such a person. that it was\n"+
		"no better than picture-like to hang by the wall, if\n"+
		"renown made it not stir, was pleased to let him seek\n"+
		"danger where he was like to find fame. To a cruel\n"+
		"war I sent him; from whence he returned, his brows\n"+
		"bound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not\n"+
		"more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child\n"+
		"than now in first seeing he had proved himself a\n"+
		"man.\n"+
		"VIRGILIA\n"+
		"But had he died in the business, madam; how then?\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"Then his good report should have been my son; I\n"+
		"therein would have found issue. Hear me profess\n"+
		"sincerely: had I a dozen sons, each in my love\n"+
		"alike and none less dear than thine and my good\n"+
		"Marcius, I had rather had eleven die nobly for their\n"+
		"country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.\n"+
		"Enter a Gentlewoman\n"+
		"Gentlewoman\n"+
		"Madam, the Lady Valeria is come to visit you.\n"+
		"VIRGILIA\n"+
		"Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself.\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"Indeed, you shall not.\n"+
		"Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum,\n"+
		"See him pluck Aufidius down by the hair,\n"+
		"As children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him:\n"+
		"Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus:\n"+
		"'Come on, you cowards! you were got in fear,\n"+
		"Though you were born in Rome:' his bloody brow\n"+
		"With his mail'd hand then wiping, forth he goes,\n"+
		"Like to a harvest-man that's task'd to mow\n"+
		"Or all or lose his hire.\n"+
		"VIRGILIA\n"+
		"His bloody brow! O Jupiter, no blood!\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"Away, you fool! it more becomes a man\n"+
		"Than gilt his trophy: the breasts of Hecuba,\n"+
		"When she did suckle Hector, look'd not lovelier\n"+
		"Than Hector's forehead when it spit forth blood\n"+
		"At Grecian sword, contemning. Tell Valeria,\n"+
		"We are fit to bid her welcome.\n"+
		"Exit Gentlewoman\n"+
		"VIRGILIA\n"+
		"Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"He'll beat Aufidius 'head below his knee\n"+
		"And tread upon his neck.\n"+
		"Enter VALERIA, with an Usher and Gentlewoman\n"+
		"VALERIA\n"+
		"My ladies both, good day to you.\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"Sweet madam.\n"+
		"VIRGILIA\n"+
		"I am glad to see your ladyship.\n"+
		"VALERIA\n"+
		"How do you both? you are manifest house-keepers.\n"+
		"What are you sewing here? A fine spot, in good\n"+
		"faith. How does your little son?\n"+
		"VIRGILIA\n"+
		"I thank your ladyship; well, good madam.\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"He had rather see the swords, and hear a drum, than\n"+
		"look upon his school-master.\n"+
		"VALERIA\n"+
		"O' my word, the father's son: I'll swear,'tis a\n"+
		"very pretty boy. O' my troth, I looked upon him o'\n"+
		"Wednesday half an hour together: has such a\n"+
		"confirmed countenance. I saw him run after a gilded\n"+
		"butterfly: and when he caught it, he let it go\n"+
		"again; and after it again; and over and over he\n"+
		"comes, and again; catched it again; or whether his\n"+
		"fall enraged him, or how 'twas, he did so set his\n"+
		"teeth and tear it; O, I warrant it, how he mammocked\n"+
		"it!\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"One on 's father's moods.\n"+
		"VALERIA\n"+
		"Indeed, la, 'tis a noble child.\n"+
		"VIRGILIA\n"+
		"A crack, madam.\n"+
		"VALERIA\n"+
		"Come, lay aside your stitchery; I must have you play\n"+
		"the idle husewife with me this afternoon.\n"+
		"VIRGILIA\n"+
		"No, good madam; I will not out of doors.\n"+
		"VALERIA\n"+
		"Not out of doors!\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"She shall, she shall.\n"+
		"VIRGILIA\n"+
		"Indeed, no, by your patience; I'll not over the\n"+
		"threshold till my lord return from the wars.\n"+
		"VALERIA\n"+
		"Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably: come,\n"+
		"you must go visit the good lady that lies in.\n"+
		"VIRGILIA\n"+
		"I will wish her speedy strength, and visit her with\n"+
		"my prayers; but I cannot go thither.\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"Why, I pray you?\n"+
		"VIRGILIA\n"+
		"'Tis not to save labour, nor that I want love.\n"+
		"VALERIA\n"+
		"You would be another Penelope: yet, they say, all\n"+
		"the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill\n"+
		"Ithaca full of moths. Come; I would your cambric\n"+
		"were sensible as your finger, that you might leave\n"+
		"pricking it for pity. Come, you shall go with us.\n"+
		"VIRGILIA\n"+
		"No, good madam, pardon me; indeed, I will not forth.\n"+
		"VALERIA\n"+
		"In truth, la, go with me; and I'll tell you\n"+
		"excellent news of your husband.\n"+
		"VIRGILIA\n"+
		"O, good madam, there can be none yet.\n"+
		"VALERIA\n"+
		"Verily, I do not jest with you; there came news from\n"+
		"him last night.\n"+
		"VIRGILIA\n"+
		"Indeed, madam?\n"+
		"VALERIA\n"+
		"In earnest, it's true; I heard a senator speak it.\n"+
		"Thus it is: the Volsces have an army forth; against\n"+
		"whom Cominius the general is gone, with one part of\n"+
		"our Roman power: your lord and Titus Lartius are set\n"+
		"down before their city Corioli; they nothing doubt\n"+
		"prevailing and to make it brief wars. This is true,\n"+
		"on mine honour; and so, I pray, go with us.\n"+
		"VIRGILIA\n"+
		"Give me excuse, good madam; I will obey you in every\n"+
		"thing hereafter.\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"Let her alone, lady: as she is now, she will but\n"+
		"disease our better mirth.\n"+
		"VALERIA\n"+
		"In troth, I think she would. Fare you well, then.\n"+
		"Come, good sweet lady. Prithee, Virgilia, turn thy\n"+
		"solemness out o' door. and go along with us.\n"+
		"VIRGILIA\n"+
		"No, at a word, madam; indeed, I must not. I wish\n"+
		"you much mirth.\n"+
		"VALERIA\n"+
		"Well, then, farewell.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV. Before Corioli.\n"+
		"Enter, with drum and colours, MARCIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, Captains and Soldiers. To them a Messenger\n"+
		"MARCIUS\n"+
		"Yonder comes news. A wager they have met.\n"+
		"LARTIUS\n"+
		"My horse to yours, no.\n"+
		"MARCIUS\n"+
		"'Tis done.\n"+
		"LARTIUS\n"+
		"Agreed.\n"+
		"MARCIUS\n"+
		"Say, has our general met the enemy?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"They lie in view; but have not spoke as yet.\n"+
		"LARTIUS\n"+
		"So, the good horse is mine.\n"+
		"MARCIUS\n"+
		"I'll buy him of you.\n"+
		"LARTIUS\n"+
		"No, I'll nor sell nor give him: lend you him I will\n"+
		"For half a hundred years. Summon the town.\n"+
		"MARCIUS\n"+
		"How far off lie these armies?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Within this mile and half.\n"+
		"MARCIUS\n"+
		"Then shall we hear their 'larum, and they ours.\n"+
		"Now, Mars, I prithee, make us quick in work,\n"+
		"That we with smoking swords may march from hence,\n"+
		"To help our fielded friends! Come, blow thy blast.\n"+
		"They sound a parley. Enter two Senators with others on the walls\n"+
		"Tutus Aufidius, is he within your walls?\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"No, nor a man that fears you less than he,\n"+
		"That's lesser than a little.\n"+
		"Drums afar off\n"+
		"Hark! our drums\n"+
		"Are bringing forth our youth. We'll break our walls,\n"+
		"Rather than they shall pound us up: our gates,\n"+
		"Which yet seem shut, we, have but pinn'd with rushes;\n"+
		"They'll open of themselves.\n"+
		"Alarum afar off\n"+
		"Hark you. far off!\n"+
		"There is Aufidius; list, what work he makes\n"+
		"Amongst your cloven army.\n"+
		"MARCIUS\n"+
		"O, they are at it!\n"+
		"LARTIUS\n"+
		"Their noise be our instruction. Ladders, ho!\n"+
		"Enter the army of the Volsces\n"+
		"MARCIUS\n"+
		"They fear us not, but issue forth their city.\n"+
		"Now put your shields before your hearts, and fight\n"+
		"With hearts more proof than shields. Advance,\n"+
		"brave Titus:\n"+
		"They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts,\n"+
		"Which makes me sweat with wrath. Come on, my fellows:\n"+
		"He that retires I'll take him for a Volsce,\n"+
		"And he shall feel mine edge.\n"+
		"Alarum. The Romans are beat back to their trenches. Re-enter MARCIUS cursing\n"+
		"MARCIUS\n"+
		"All the contagion of the south light on you,\n"+
		"You shames of Rome! you herd of--Boils and plagues\n"+
		"Plaster you o'er, that you may be abhorr'd\n"+
		"Further than seen and one infect another\n"+
		"Against the wind a mile! You souls of geese,\n"+
		"That bear the shapes of men, how have you run\n"+
		"From slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!\n"+
		"All hurt behind; backs red, and faces pale\n"+
		"With flight and agued fear! Mend and charge home,\n"+
		"Or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe\n"+
		"And make my wars on you: look to't: come on;\n"+
		"If you'll stand fast, we'll beat them to their wives,\n"+
		"As they us to our trenches followed.\n"+
		"Another alarum. The Volsces fly, and MARCIUS follows them to the gates\n"+
		"So, now the gates are ope: now prove good seconds:\n"+
		"'Tis for the followers fortune widens them,\n"+
		"Not for the fliers: mark me, and do the like.\n"+
		"Enters the gates\n"+
		"First Soldier\n"+
		"Fool-hardiness; not I.\n"+
		"Second Soldier\n"+
		"Nor I.\n"+
		"MARCIUS is shut in\n"+
		"First Soldier\n"+
		"See, they have shut him in.\n"+
		"All\n"+
		"To the pot, I warrant him.\n"+
		"Alarum continues\n"+
		"Re-enter TITUS LARTIUS\n"+
		"LARTIUS\n"+
		"What is become of Marcius?\n"+
		"All\n"+
		"Slain, sir, doubtless.\n"+
		"First Soldier\n"+
		"Following the fliers at the very heels,\n"+
		"With them he enters; who, upon the sudden,\n"+
		"Clapp'd to their gates: he is himself alone,\n"+
		"To answer all the city.\n"+
		"LARTIUS\n"+
		"O noble fellow!\n"+
		"Who sensibly outdares his senseless sword,\n"+
		"And, when it bows, stands up. Thou art left, Marcius:\n"+
		"A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,\n"+
		"Were not so rich a jewel. Thou wast a soldier\n"+
		"Even to Cato's wish, not fierce and terrible\n"+
		"Only in strokes; but, with thy grim looks and\n"+
		"The thunder-like percussion of thy sounds,\n"+
		"Thou madst thine enemies shake, as if the world\n"+
		"Were feverous and did tremble.\n"+
		"Re-enter MARCIUS, bleeding, assaulted by the enemy\n"+
		"First Soldier\n"+
		"Look, sir.\n"+
		"LARTIUS\n"+
		"O,'tis Marcius!\n"+
		"Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike.\n"+
		"They fight, and all enter the city\n"+
		"SCENE V. Corioli. A street.\n"+
		"Enter certain Romans, with spoils\n"+
		"First Roman\n"+
		"This will I carry to Rome.\n"+
		"Second Roman\n"+
		"And I this.\n"+
		"Third Roman\n"+
		"A murrain on't! I took this for silver.\n"+
		"Alarum continues still afar off\n"+
		"Enter MARCIUS and TITUS LARTIUS with a trumpet\n"+
		"MARCIUS\n"+
		"See here these movers that do prize their hours\n"+
		"At a crack'd drachm! Cushions, leaden spoons,\n"+
		"Irons of a doit, doublets that hangmen would\n"+
		"Bury with those that wore them, these base slaves,\n"+
		"Ere yet the fight be done, pack up: down with them!\n"+
		"And hark, what noise the general makes! To him!\n"+
		"There is the man of my soul's hate, Aufidius,\n"+
		"Piercing our Romans: then, valiant Titus, take\n"+
		"Convenient numbers to make good the city;\n"+
		"Whilst I, with those that have the spirit, will haste\n"+
		"To help Cominius.\n"+
		"LARTIUS\n"+
		"Worthy sir, thou bleed'st;\n"+
		"Thy exercise hath been too violent for\n"+
		"A second course of fight.\n"+
		"MARCIUS\n"+
		"Sir, praise me not;\n"+
		"My work hath yet not warm'd me: fare you well:\n"+
		"The blood I drop is rather physical\n"+
		"Than dangerous to me: to Aufidius thus\n"+
		"I will appear, and fight.\n"+
		"LARTIUS\n"+
		"Now the fair goddess, Fortune,\n"+
		"Fall deep in love with thee; and her great charms\n"+
		"Misguide thy opposers' swords! Bold gentleman,\n"+
		"Prosperity be thy page!\n"+
		"MARCIUS\n"+
		"Thy friend no less\n"+
		"Than those she placeth highest! So, farewell.\n"+
		"LARTIUS\n"+
		"Thou worthiest Marcius!\n"+
		"Exit MARCIUS\n"+
		"Go, sound thy trumpet in the market-place;\n"+
		"Call thither all the officers o' the town,\n"+
		"Where they shall know our mind: away!\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE VI. Near the camp of Cominius.\n"+
		"Enter COMINIUS, as it were in retire, with soldiers\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"Breathe you, my friends: well fought;\n"+
		"we are come off\n"+
		"Like Romans, neither foolish in our stands,\n"+
		"Nor cowardly in retire: believe me, sirs,\n"+
		"We shall be charged again. Whiles we have struck,\n"+
		"By interims and conveying gusts we have heard\n"+
		"The charges of our friends. Ye Roman gods!\n"+
		"Lead their successes as we wish our own,\n"+
		"That both our powers, with smiling\n"+
		"fronts encountering,\n"+
		"May give you thankful sacrifice.\n"+
		"Enter a Messenger\n"+
		"Thy news?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"The citizens of Corioli have issued,\n"+
		"And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle:\n"+
		"I saw our party to their trenches driven,\n"+
		"And then I came away.\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"Though thou speak'st truth,\n"+
		"Methinks thou speak'st not well.\n"+
		"How long is't since?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Above an hour, my lord.\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"'Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums:\n"+
		"How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour,\n"+
		"And bring thy news so late?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Spies of the Volsces\n"+
		"Held me in chase, that I was forced to wheel\n"+
		"Three or four miles about, else had I, sir,\n"+
		"Half an hour since brought my report.\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"Who's yonder,\n"+
		"That does appear as he were flay'd? O gods\n"+
		"He has the stamp of Marcius; and I have\n"+
		"Before-time seen him thus.\n"+
		"MARCIUS\n"+
		"[Within] Come I too late?\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabour\n"+
		"More than I know the sound of Marcius' tongue\n"+
		"From every meaner man.\n"+
		"Enter MARCIUS\n"+
		"MARCIUS\n"+
		"Come I too late?\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"Ay, if you come not in the blood of others,\n"+
		"But mantled in your own.\n"+
		"MARCIUS\n"+
		"O, let me clip ye\n"+
		"In arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heart\n"+
		"As merry as when our nuptial day was done,\n"+
		"And tapers burn'd to bedward!\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"Flower of warriors,\n"+
		"How is it with Titus Lartius?\n"+
		"MARCIUS\n"+
		"As with a man busied about decrees:\n"+
		"Condemning some to death, and some to exile;\n"+
		"Ransoming him, or pitying, threatening the other;\n"+
		"Holding Corioli in the name of Rome,\n"+
		"Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash,\n"+
		"To let him slip at will.\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"Where is that slave\n"+
		"Which told me they had beat you to your trenches?\n"+
		"Where is he? call him hither.\n"+
		"MARCIUS\n"+
		"Let him alone;\n"+
		"He did inform the truth: but for our gentlemen,\n"+
		"The common file--a plague! tribunes for them!--\n"+
		"The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge\n"+
		"From rascals worse than they.\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"But how prevail'd you?\n"+
		"MARCIUS\n"+
		"Will the time serve to tell? I do not think.\n"+
		"Where is the enemy? are you lords o' the field?\n"+
		"If not, why cease you till you are so?\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"Marcius,\n"+
		"We have at disadvantage fought and did\n"+
		"Retire to win our purpose.\n"+
		"MARCIUS\n"+
		"How lies their battle? know you on which side\n"+
		"They have placed their men of trust?\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"As I guess, Marcius,\n"+
		"Their bands i' the vaward are the Antiates,\n"+
		"Of their best trust; o'er them Aufidius,\n"+
		"Their very heart of hope.\n"+
		"MARCIUS\n"+
		"I do beseech you,\n"+
		"By all the battles wherein we have fought,\n"+
		"By the blood we have shed together, by the vows\n"+
		"We have made to endure friends, that you directly\n"+
		"Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates;\n"+
		"And that you not delay the present, but,\n"+
		"Filling the air with swords advanced and darts,\n"+
		"We prove this very hour.\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"Though I could wish\n"+
		"You were conducted to a gentle bath\n"+
		"And balms applied to, you, yet dare I never\n"+
		"Deny your asking: take your choice of those\n"+
		"That best can aid your action.\n"+
		"MARCIUS\n"+
		"Those are they\n"+
		"That most are willing. If any such be here--\n"+
		"As it were sin to doubt--that love this painting\n"+
		"Wherein you see me smear'd; if any fear\n"+
		"Lesser his person than an ill report;\n"+
		"If any think brave death outweighs bad life\n"+
		"And that his country's dearer than himself;\n"+
		"Let him alone, or so many so minded,\n"+
		"Wave thus, to express his disposition,\n"+
		"And follow Marcius.\n"+
		"They all shout and wave their swords, take him up in their arms, and cast up their caps\n"+
		"O, me alone! make you a sword of me?\n"+
		"If these shows be not outward, which of you\n"+
		"But is four Volsces? none of you but is\n"+
		"Able to bear against the great Aufidius\n"+
		"A shield as hard as his. A certain number,\n"+
		"Though thanks to all, must I select\n"+
		"from all: the rest\n"+
		"Shall bear the business in some other fight,\n"+
		"As cause will be obey'd. Please you to march;\n"+
		"And four shall quickly draw out my command,\n"+
		"Which men are best inclined.\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"March on, my fellows:\n"+
		"Make good this ostentation, and you shall\n"+
		"Divide in all with us.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE VII. The gates of Corioli.\n"+
		"TITUS LARTIUS, having set a guard upon Corioli, going with drum and trumpet toward COMINIUS and CAIUS MARCIUS, enters with Lieutenant, other Soldiers, and a Scout\n"+
		"LARTIUS\n"+
		"So, let the ports be guarded: keep your duties,\n"+
		"As I have set them down. If I do send, dispatch\n"+
		"Those centuries to our aid: the rest will serve\n"+
		"For a short holding: if we lose the field,\n"+
		"We cannot keep the town.\n"+
		"Lieutenant\n"+
		"Fear not our care, sir.\n"+
		"LARTIUS\n"+
		"Hence, and shut your gates upon's.\n"+
		"Our guider, come; to the Roman camp conduct us.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE VIII. A field of battle.\n"+
		"Alarum as in battle. Enter, from opposite sides, MARCIUS and AUFIDIUS\n"+
		"MARCIUS\n"+
		"I'll fight with none but thee; for I do hate thee\n"+
		"Worse than a promise-breaker.\n"+
		"AUFIDIUS\n"+
		"We hate alike:\n"+
		"Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor\n"+
		"More than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot.\n"+
		"MARCIUS\n"+
		"Let the first budger die the other's slave,\n"+
		"And the gods doom him after!\n"+
		"AUFIDIUS\n"+
		"If I fly, Marcius,\n"+
		"Holloa me like a hare.\n"+
		"MARCIUS\n"+
		"Within these three hours, Tullus,\n"+
		"Alone I fought in your Corioli walls,\n"+
		"And made what work I pleased: 'tis not my blood\n"+
		"Wherein thou seest me mask'd; for thy revenge\n"+
		"Wrench up thy power to the highest.\n"+
		"AUFIDIUS\n"+
		"Wert thou the Hector\n"+
		"That was the whip of your bragg'd progeny,\n"+
		"Thou shouldst not scape me here.\n"+
		"They fight, and certain Volsces come to the aid of AUFIDIUS. MARCIUS fights till they be driven in breathless\n"+
		"Officious, and not valiant, you have shamed me\n"+
		"In your condemned seconds.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IX. The Roman camp.\n"+
		"Flourish. Alarum. A retreat is sounded. Flourish. Enter, from one side, COMINIUS with the Romans; from the other side, MARCIUS, with his arm in a scarf\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"If I should tell thee o'er this thy day's work,\n"+
		"Thou'ldst not believe thy deeds: but I'll report it\n"+
		"Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles,\n"+
		"Where great patricians shall attend and shrug,\n"+
		"I' the end admire, where ladies shall be frighted,\n"+
		"And, gladly quaked, hear more; where the\n"+
		"dull tribunes,\n"+
		"That, with the fusty plebeians, hate thine honours,\n"+
		"Shall say against their hearts 'We thank the gods\n"+
		"Our Rome hath such a soldier.'\n"+
		"Yet camest thou to a morsel of this feast,\n"+
		"Having fully dined before.\n"+
		"Enter TITUS LARTIUS, with his power, from the pursuit\n"+
		"LARTIUS\n"+
		"O general,\n"+
		"Here is the steed, we the caparison:\n"+
		"Hadst thou beheld--\n"+
		"MARCIUS\n"+
		"Pray now, no more: my mother,\n"+
		"Who has a charter to extol her blood,\n"+
		"When she does praise me grieves me. I have done\n"+
		"As you have done; that's what I can; induced\n"+
		"As you have been; that's for my country:\n"+
		"He that has but effected his good will\n"+
		"Hath overta'en mine act.\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"You shall not be\n"+
		"The grave of your deserving; Rome must know\n"+
		"The value of her own: 'twere a concealment\n"+
		"Worse than a theft, no less than a traducement,\n"+
		"To hide your doings; and to silence that,\n"+
		"Which, to the spire and top of praises vouch'd,\n"+
		"Would seem but modest: therefore, I beseech you\n"+
		"In sign of what you are, not to reward\n"+
		"What you have done--before our army hear me.\n"+
		"MARCIUS\n"+
		"I have some wounds upon me, and they smart\n"+
		"To hear themselves remember'd.\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"Should they not,\n"+
		"Well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude,\n"+
		"And tent themselves with death. Of all the horses,\n"+
		"Whereof we have ta'en good and good store, of all\n"+
		"The treasure in this field achieved and city,\n"+
		"We render you the tenth, to be ta'en forth,\n"+
		"Before the common distribution, at\n"+
		"Your only choice.\n"+
		"MARCIUS\n"+
		"I thank you, general;\n"+
		"But cannot make my heart consent to take\n"+
		"A bribe to pay my sword: I do refuse it;\n"+
		"And stand upon my common part with those\n"+
		"That have beheld the doing.\n"+
		"A long flourish. They all cry 'Marcius! Marcius!' cast up their caps and lances: COMINIUS and LARTIUS stand bare\n"+
		"MARCIUS\n"+
		"May these same instruments, which you profane,\n"+
		"Never sound more! when drums and trumpets shall\n"+
		"I' the field prove flatterers, let courts and cities be\n"+
		"Made all of false-faced soothing!\n"+
		"When steel grows soft as the parasite's silk,\n"+
		"Let him be made a coverture for the wars!\n"+
		"No more, I say! For that I have not wash'd\n"+
		"My nose that bled, or foil'd some debile wretch.--\n"+
		"Which, without note, here's many else have done,--\n"+
		"You shout me forth\n"+
		"In acclamations hyperbolical;\n"+
		"As if I loved my little should be dieted\n"+
		"In praises sauced with lies.\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"Too modest are you;\n"+
		"More cruel to your good report than grateful\n"+
		"To us that give you truly: by your patience,\n"+
		"If 'gainst yourself you be incensed, we'll put you,\n"+
		"Like one that means his proper harm, in manacles,\n"+
		"Then reason safely with you. Therefore, be it known,\n"+
		"As to us, to all the world, that Caius Marcius\n"+
		"Wears this war's garland: in token of the which,\n"+
		"My noble steed, known to the camp, I give him,\n"+
		"With all his trim belonging; and from this time,\n"+
		"For what he did before Corioli, call him,\n"+
		"With all the applause and clamour of the host,\n"+
		"CAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS! Bear\n"+
		"The addition nobly ever!\n"+
		"Flourish. Trumpets sound, and drums\n"+
		"All\n"+
		"Caius Marcius Coriolanus!\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"I will go wash;\n"+
		"And when my face is fair, you shall perceive\n"+
		"Whether I blush or no: howbeit, I thank you.\n"+
		"I mean to stride your steed, and at all times\n"+
		"To undercrest your good addition\n"+
		"To the fairness of my power.\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"So, to our tent;\n"+
		"Where, ere we do repose us, we will write\n"+
		"To Rome of our success. You, Titus Lartius,\n"+
		"Must to Corioli back: send us to Rome\n"+
		"The best, with whom we may articulate,\n"+
		"For their own good and ours.\n"+
		"LARTIUS\n"+
		"I shall, my lord.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"The gods begin to mock me. I, that now\n"+
		"Refused most princely gifts, am bound to beg\n"+
		"Of my lord general.\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"Take't; 'tis yours. What is't?\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"I sometime lay here in Corioli\n"+
		"At a poor man's house; he used me kindly:\n"+
		"He cried to me; I saw him prisoner;\n"+
		"But then Aufidius was with in my view,\n"+
		"And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity: I request you\n"+
		"To give my poor host freedom.\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"O, well begg'd!\n"+
		"Were he the butcher of my son, he should\n"+
		"Be free as is the wind. Deliver him, Titus.\n"+
		"LARTIUS\n"+
		"Marcius, his name?\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"By Jupiter! forgot.\n"+
		"I am weary; yea, my memory is tired.\n"+
		"Have we no wine here?\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"Go we to our tent:\n"+
		"The blood upon your visage dries; 'tis time\n"+
		"It should be look'd to: come.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE X. The camp of the Volsces.\n"+
		"A flourish. Cornets. Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS, bloody, with two or three Soldiers\n"+
		"AUFIDIUS\n"+
		"The town is ta'en!\n"+
		"First Soldier\n"+
		"'Twill be deliver'd back on good condition.\n"+
		"AUFIDIUS\n"+
		"Condition!\n"+
		"I would I were a Roman; for I cannot,\n"+
		"Being a Volsce, be that I am. Condition!\n"+
		"What good condition can a treaty find\n"+
		"I' the part that is at mercy? Five times, Marcius,\n"+
		"I have fought with thee: so often hast thou beat me,\n"+
		"And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter\n"+
		"As often as we eat. By the elements,\n"+
		"If e'er again I meet him beard to beard,\n"+
		"He's mine, or I am his: mine emulation\n"+
		"Hath not that honour in't it had; for where\n"+
		"I thought to crush him in an equal force,\n"+
		"True sword to sword, I'll potch at him some way\n"+
		"Or wrath or craft may get him.\n"+
		"First Soldier\n"+
		"He's the devil.\n"+
		"AUFIDIUS\n"+
		"Bolder, though not so subtle. My valour's poison'd\n"+
		"With only suffering stain by him; for him\n"+
		"Shall fly out of itself: nor sleep nor sanctuary,\n"+
		"Being naked, sick, nor fane nor Capitol,\n"+
		"The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice,\n"+
		"Embarquements all of fury, shall lift up\n"+
		"Their rotten privilege and custom 'gainst\n"+
		"My hate to Marcius: where I find him, were it\n"+
		"At home, upon my brother's guard, even there,\n"+
		"Against the hospitable canon, would I\n"+
		"Wash my fierce hand in's heart. Go you to the city;\n"+
		"Learn how 'tis held; and what they are that must\n"+
		"Be hostages for Rome.\n"+
		"First Soldier\n"+
		"Will not you go?\n"+
		"AUFIDIUS\n"+
		"I am attended at the cypress grove: I pray you--\n"+
		"'Tis south the city mills--bring me word thither\n"+
		"How the world goes, that to the pace of it\n"+
		"I may spur on my journey.\n"+
		"First Soldier\n"+
		"I shall, sir.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT II\n"+
		"SCENE I. Rome. A public place.\n"+
		"Enter MENENIUS with the two Tribunes of the people, SICINIUS and BRUTUS.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"The augurer tells me we shall have news to-night.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"Good or bad?\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Not according to the prayer of the people, for they\n"+
		"love not Marcius.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Pray you, who does the wolf love?\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"The lamb.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Ay, to devour him; as the hungry plebeians would the\n"+
		"noble Marcius.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"He's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"He's a bear indeed, that lives like a lamb. You two\n"+
		"are old men: tell me one thing that I shall ask you.\n"+
		"Both\n"+
		"Well, sir.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"In what enormity is Marcius poor in, that you two\n"+
		"have not in abundance?\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"He's poor in no one fault, but stored with all.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Especially in pride.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"And topping all others in boasting.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"This is strange now: do you two know how you are\n"+
		"censured here in the city, I mean of us o' the\n"+
		"right-hand file? do you?\n"+
		"Both\n"+
		"Why, how are we censured?\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Because you talk of pride now,--will you not be angry?\n"+
		"Both\n"+
		"Well, well, sir, well.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Why, 'tis no great matter; for a very little thief of\n"+
		"occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience:\n"+
		"give your dispositions the reins, and be angry at\n"+
		"your pleasures; at the least if you take it as a\n"+
		"pleasure to you in being so. You blame Marcius for\n"+
		"being proud?\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"We do it not alone, sir.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"I know you can do very little alone; for your helps\n"+
		"are many, or else your actions would grow wondrous\n"+
		"single: your abilities are too infant-like for\n"+
		"doing much alone. You talk of pride: O that you\n"+
		"could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks,\n"+
		"and make but an interior survey of your good selves!\n"+
		"O that you could!\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"What then, sir?\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting,\n"+
		"proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, as\n"+
		"any in Rome.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Menenius, you are known well enough too.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that\n"+
		"loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying\n"+
		"Tiber in't; said to be something imperfect in\n"+
		"favouring the first complaint; hasty and tinder-like\n"+
		"upon too trivial motion; one that converses more\n"+
		"with the buttock of the night than with the forehead\n"+
		"of the morning: what I think I utter, and spend my\n"+
		"malice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen as\n"+
		"you are--I cannot call you Lycurguses--if the drink\n"+
		"you give me touch my palate adversely, I make a\n"+
		"crooked face at it. I can't say your worships have\n"+
		"delivered the matter well, when I find the ass in\n"+
		"compound with the major part of your syllables: and\n"+
		"though I must be content to bear with those that say\n"+
		"you are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that\n"+
		"tell you you have good faces. If you see this in\n"+
		"the map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known\n"+
		"well enough too? what barm can your bisson\n"+
		"conspectuities glean out of this character, if I be\n"+
		"known well enough too?\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"You know neither me, yourselves nor any thing. You\n"+
		"are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs: you\n"+
		"wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a\n"+
		"cause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller;\n"+
		"and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a\n"+
		"second day of audience. When you are hearing a\n"+
		"matter between party and party, if you chance to be\n"+
		"pinched with the colic, you make faces like\n"+
		"mummers; set up the bloody flag against all\n"+
		"patience; and, in roaring for a chamber-pot,\n"+
		"dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled\n"+
		"by your hearing: all the peace you make in their\n"+
		"cause is, calling both the parties knaves. You are\n"+
		"a pair of strange ones.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"Come, come, you are well understood to be a\n"+
		"perfecter giber for the table than a necessary\n"+
		"bencher in the Capitol.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Our very priests must become mockers, if they shall\n"+
		"encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When\n"+
		"you speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the\n"+
		"wagging of your beards; and your beards deserve not\n"+
		"so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's\n"+
		"cushion, or to be entombed in an ass's pack-\n"+
		"saddle. Yet you must be saying, Marcius is proud;\n"+
		"who in a cheap estimation, is worth predecessors\n"+
		"since Deucalion, though peradventure some of the\n"+
		"best of 'em were hereditary hangmen. God-den to\n"+
		"your worships: more of your conversation would\n"+
		"infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly\n"+
		"plebeians: I will be bold to take my leave of you.\n"+
		"BRUTUS and SICINIUS go aside\n"+
		"Enter VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, and VALERIA\n"+
		"How now, my as fair as noble ladies,--and the moon,\n"+
		"were she earthly, no nobler,--whither do you follow\n"+
		"your eyes so fast?\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"Honourable Menenius, my boy Marcius approaches; for\n"+
		"the love of Juno, let's go.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Ha! Marcius coming home!\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"Ay, worthy Menenius; and with most prosperous\n"+
		"approbation.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee. Hoo!\n"+
		"Marcius coming home!\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"VIRGILIA\n"+
		"Nay,'tis true.\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"Look, here's a letter from him: the state hath\n"+
		"another, his wife another; and, I think, there's one\n"+
		"at home for you.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"I will make my very house reel tonight: a letter for\n"+
		"me!\n"+
		"VIRGILIA\n"+
		"Yes, certain, there's a letter for you; I saw't.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"A letter for me! it gives me an estate of seven\n"+
		"years' health; in which time I will make a lip at\n"+
		"the physician: the most sovereign prescription in\n"+
		"Galen is but empiricutic, and, to this preservative,\n"+
		"of no better report than a horse-drench. Is he\n"+
		"not wounded? he was wont to come home wounded.\n"+
		"VIRGILIA\n"+
		"O, no, no, no.\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"O, he is wounded; I thank the gods for't.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"So do I too, if it be not too much: brings a'\n"+
		"victory in his pocket? the wounds become him.\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"On's brows: Menenius, he comes the third time home\n"+
		"with the oaken garland.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"Titus Lartius writes, they fought together, but\n"+
		"Aufidius got off.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"And 'twas time for him too, I'll warrant him that:\n"+
		"an he had stayed by him, I would not have been so\n"+
		"fidiused for all the chests in Corioli, and the gold\n"+
		"that's in them. Is the senate possessed of this?\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"Good ladies, let's go. Yes, yes, yes; the senate\n"+
		"has letters from the general, wherein he gives my\n"+
		"son the whole name of the war: he hath in this\n"+
		"action outdone his former deeds doubly\n"+
		"VALERIA\n"+
		"In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Wondrous! ay, I warrant you, and not without his\n"+
		"true purchasing.\n"+
		"VIRGILIA\n"+
		"The gods grant them true!\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"True! pow, wow.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"True! I'll be sworn they are true.\n"+
		"Where is he wounded?\n"+
		"To the Tribunes\n"+
		"God save your good worships! Marcius is coming\n"+
		"home: he has more cause to be proud. Where is he wounded?\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"I' the shoulder and i' the left arm there will be\n"+
		"large cicatrices to show the people, when he shall\n"+
		"stand for his place. He received in the repulse of\n"+
		"Tarquin seven hurts i' the body.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"One i' the neck, and two i' the thigh,--there's\n"+
		"nine that I know.\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"He had, before this last expedition, twenty-five\n"+
		"wounds upon him.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Now it's twenty-seven: every gash was an enemy's grave.\n"+
		"A shout and flourish\n"+
		"Hark! the trumpets.\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"These are the ushers of Marcius: before him he\n"+
		"carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears:\n"+
		"Death, that dark spirit, in 's nervy arm doth lie;\n"+
		"Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.\n"+
		"A sennet. Trumpets sound. Enter COMINIUS the general, and TITUS LARTIUS; between them, CORIOLANUS, crowned with an oaken garland; with Captains and Soldiers, and a Herald\n"+
		"Herald\n"+
		"Know, Rome, that all alone Marcius did fight\n"+
		"Within Corioli gates: where he hath won,\n"+
		"With fame, a name to Caius Marcius; these\n"+
		"In honour follows Coriolanus.\n"+
		"Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!\n"+
		"Flourish\n"+
		"All\n"+
		"Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"No more of this; it does offend my heart:\n"+
		"Pray now, no more.\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"Look, sir, your mother!\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"O,\n"+
		"You have, I know, petition'd all the gods\n"+
		"For my prosperity!\n"+
		"Kneels\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"Nay, my good soldier, up;\n"+
		"My gentle Marcius, worthy Caius, and\n"+
		"By deed-achieving honour newly named,--\n"+
		"What is it?--Coriolanus must I call thee?--\n"+
		"But O, thy wife!\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"My gracious silence, hail!\n"+
		"Wouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home,\n"+
		"That weep'st to see me triumph? Ay, my dear,\n"+
		"Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear,\n"+
		"And mothers that lack sons.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Now, the gods crown thee!\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"And live you yet?\n"+
		"To VALERIA\n"+
		"O my sweet lady, pardon.\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"I know not where to turn: O, welcome home:\n"+
		"And welcome, general: and ye're welcome all.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"A hundred thousand welcomes. I could weep\n"+
		"And I could laugh, I am light and heavy. Welcome.\n"+
		"A curse begin at very root on's heart,\n"+
		"That is not glad to see thee! You are three\n"+
		"That Rome should dote on: yet, by the faith of men,\n"+
		"We have some old crab-trees here\n"+
		"at home that will not\n"+
		"Be grafted to your relish. Yet welcome, warriors:\n"+
		"We call a nettle but a nettle and\n"+
		"The faults of fools but folly.\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"Ever right.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Menenius ever, ever.\n"+
		"Herald\n"+
		"Give way there, and go on!\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"[To VOLUMNIA and VIRGILIA] Your hand, and yours:\n"+
		"Ere in our own house I do shade my head,\n"+
		"The good patricians must be visited;\n"+
		"From whom I have received not only greetings,\n"+
		"But with them change of honours.\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"I have lived\n"+
		"To see inherited my very wishes\n"+
		"And the buildings of my fancy: only\n"+
		"There's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but\n"+
		"Our Rome will cast upon thee.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Know, good mother,\n"+
		"I had rather be their servant in my way,\n"+
		"Than sway with them in theirs.\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"On, to the Capitol!\n"+
		"Flourish. Cornets. Exeunt in state, as before. BRUTUS and SICINIUS come forward\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"All tongues speak of him, and the bleared sights\n"+
		"Are spectacled to see him: your prattling nurse\n"+
		"Into a rapture lets her baby cry\n"+
		"While she chats him: the kitchen malkin pins\n"+
		"Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,\n"+
		"Clambering the walls to eye him: stalls, bulks, windows,\n"+
		"Are smother'd up, leads fill'd, and ridges horsed\n"+
		"With variable complexions, all agreeing\n"+
		"In earnestness to see him: seld-shown flamens\n"+
		"Do press among the popular throngs and puff\n"+
		"To win a vulgar station: or veil'd dames\n"+
		"Commit the war of white and damask in\n"+
		"Their nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spoil\n"+
		"Of Phoebus' burning kisses: such a pother\n"+
		"As if that whatsoever god who leads him\n"+
		"Were slily crept into his human powers\n"+
		"And gave him graceful posture.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"On the sudden,\n"+
		"I warrant him consul.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"Then our office may,\n"+
		"During his power, go sleep.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"He cannot temperately transport his honours\n"+
		"From where he should begin and end, but will\n"+
		"Lose those he hath won.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"In that there's comfort.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Doubt not\n"+
		"The commoners, for whom we stand, but they\n"+
		"Upon their ancient malice will forget\n"+
		"With the least cause these his new honours, which\n"+
		"That he will give them make I as little question\n"+
		"As he is proud to do't.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"I heard him swear,\n"+
		"Were he to stand for consul, never would he\n"+
		"Appear i' the market-place nor on him put\n"+
		"The napless vesture of humility;\n"+
		"Nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds\n"+
		"To the people, beg their stinking breaths.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"'Tis right.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"It was his word: O, he would miss it rather\n"+
		"Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him,\n"+
		"And the desire of the nobles.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"I wish no better\n"+
		"Than have him hold that purpose and to put it\n"+
		"In execution.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"'Tis most like he will.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"It shall be to him then as our good wills,\n"+
		"A sure destruction.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"So it must fall out\n"+
		"To him or our authorities. For an end,\n"+
		"We must suggest the people in what hatred\n"+
		"He still hath held them; that to's power he would\n"+
		"Have made them mules, silenced their pleaders and\n"+
		"Dispropertied their freedoms, holding them,\n"+
		"In human action and capacity,\n"+
		"Of no more soul nor fitness for the world\n"+
		"Than camels in the war, who have their provand\n"+
		"Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows\n"+
		"For sinking under them.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"This, as you say, suggested\n"+
		"At some time when his soaring insolence\n"+
		"Shall touch the people--which time shall not want,\n"+
		"If he be put upon 't; and that's as easy\n"+
		"As to set dogs on sheep--will be his fire\n"+
		"To kindle their dry stubble; and their blaze\n"+
		"Shall darken him for ever.\n"+
		"Enter a Messenger\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"What's the matter?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"You are sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis thought\n"+
		"That Marcius shall be consul:\n"+
		"I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and\n"+
		"The blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,\n"+
		"Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,\n"+
		"Upon him as he pass'd: the nobles bended,\n"+
		"As to Jove's statue, and the commons made\n"+
		"A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts:\n"+
		"I never saw the like.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"Let's to the Capitol;\n"+
		"And carry with us ears and eyes for the time,\n"+
		"But hearts for the event.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Have with you.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. The same. The Capitol.\n"+
		"Enter two Officers, to lay cushions\n"+
		"First Officer\n"+
		"Come, come, they are almost here. How many stand\n"+
		"for consulships?\n"+
		"Second Officer\n"+
		"Three, they say: but 'tis thought of every one\n"+
		"Coriolanus will carry it.\n"+
		"First Officer\n"+
		"That's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance proud, and\n"+
		"loves not the common people.\n"+
		"Second Officer\n"+
		"Faith, there had been many great men that have\n"+
		"flattered the people, who ne'er loved them; and there\n"+
		"be many that they have loved, they know not\n"+
		"wherefore: so that, if they love they know not why,\n"+
		"they hate upon no better a ground: therefore, for\n"+
		"Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate\n"+
		"him manifests the true knowledge he has in their\n"+
		"disposition; and out of his noble carelessness lets\n"+
		"them plainly see't.\n"+
		"First Officer\n"+
		"If he did not care whether he had their love or no,\n"+
		"he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither\n"+
		"good nor harm: but he seeks their hate with greater\n"+
		"devotion than can render it him; and leaves\n"+
		"nothing undone that may fully discover him their\n"+
		"opposite. Now, to seem to affect the malice and\n"+
		"displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he\n"+
		"dislikes, to flatter them for their love.\n"+
		"Second Officer\n"+
		"He hath deserved worthily of his country: and his\n"+
		"ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who,\n"+
		"having been supple and courteous to the people,\n"+
		"bonneted, without any further deed to have them at\n"+
		"an into their estimation and report: but he hath so\n"+
		"planted his honours in their eyes, and his actions\n"+
		"in their hearts, that for their tongues to be\n"+
		"silent, and not confess so much, were a kind of\n"+
		"ingrateful injury; to report otherwise, were a\n"+
		"malice, that, giving itself the lie, would pluck\n"+
		"reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it.\n"+
		"First Officer\n"+
		"No more of him; he is a worthy man: make way, they\n"+
		"are coming.\n"+
		"A sennet. Enter, with actors before them, COMINIUS the consul, MENENIUS, CORIOLANUS, Senators, SICINIUS and BRUTUS. The Senators take their places; the Tribunes take their Places by themselves. CORIOLANUS stands\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Having determined of the Volsces and\n"+
		"To send for Titus Lartius, it remains,\n"+
		"As the main point of this our after-meeting,\n"+
		"To gratify his noble service that\n"+
		"Hath thus stood for his country: therefore,\n"+
		"please you,\n"+
		"Most reverend and grave elders, to desire\n"+
		"The present consul, and last general\n"+
		"In our well-found successes, to report\n"+
		"A little of that worthy work perform'd\n"+
		"By Caius Marcius Coriolanus, whom\n"+
		"We met here both to thank and to remember\n"+
		"With honours like himself.\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"Speak, good Cominius:\n"+
		"Leave nothing out for length, and make us think\n"+
		"Rather our state's defective for requital\n"+
		"Than we to stretch it out.\n"+
		"To the Tribunes\n"+
		"Masters o' the people,\n"+
		"We do request your kindest ears, and after,\n"+
		"Your loving motion toward the common body,\n"+
		"To yield what passes here.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"We are convented\n"+
		"Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts\n"+
		"Inclinable to honour and advance\n"+
		"The theme of our assembly.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"Which the rather\n"+
		"We shall be blest to do, if he remember\n"+
		"A kinder value of the people than\n"+
		"He hath hereto prized them at.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"That's off, that's off;\n"+
		"I would you rather had been silent. Please you\n"+
		"To hear Cominius speak?\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"Most willingly;\n"+
		"But yet my caution was more pertinent\n"+
		"Than the rebuke you give it.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"He loves your people\n"+
		"But tie him not to be their bedfellow.\n"+
		"Worthy Cominius, speak.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS offers to go away\n"+
		"Nay, keep your place.\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"Sit, Coriolanus; never shame to hear\n"+
		"What you have nobly done.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Your horror's pardon:\n"+
		"I had rather have my wounds to heal again\n"+
		"Than hear say how I got them.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"Sir, I hope\n"+
		"My words disbench'd you not.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"No, sir: yet oft,\n"+
		"When blows have made me stay, I fled from words.\n"+
		"You soothed not, therefore hurt not: but\n"+
		"your people,\n"+
		"I love them as they weigh.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Pray now, sit down.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"I had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun\n"+
		"When the alarum were struck than idly sit\n"+
		"To hear my nothings monster'd.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Masters of the people,\n"+
		"Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter--\n"+
		"That's thousand to one good one--when you now see\n"+
		"He had rather venture all his limbs for honour\n"+
		"Than one on's ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius.\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"I shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus\n"+
		"Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held\n"+
		"That valour is the chiefest virtue, and\n"+
		"Most dignifies the haver: if it be,\n"+
		"The man I speak of cannot in the world\n"+
		"Be singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,\n"+
		"When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought\n"+
		"Beyond the mark of others: our then dictator,\n"+
		"Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight,\n"+
		"When with his Amazonian chin he drove\n"+
		"The bristled lips before him: be bestrid\n"+
		"An o'er-press'd Roman and i' the consul's view\n"+
		"Slew three opposers: Tarquin's self he met,\n"+
		"And struck him on his knee: in that day's feats,\n"+
		"When he might act the woman in the scene,\n"+
		"He proved best man i' the field, and for his meed\n"+
		"Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age\n"+
		"Man-enter'd thus, he waxed like a sea,\n"+
		"And in the brunt of seventeen battles since\n"+
		"He lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last,\n"+
		"Before and in Corioli, let me say,\n"+
		"I cannot speak him home: he stopp'd the fliers;\n"+
		"And by his rare example made the coward\n"+
		"Turn terror into sport: as weeds before\n"+
		"A vessel under sail, so men obey'd\n"+
		"And fell below his stem: his sword, death's stamp,\n"+
		"Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot\n"+
		"He was a thing of blood, whose every motion\n"+
		"Was timed with dying cries: alone he enter'd\n"+
		"The mortal gate of the city, which he painted\n"+
		"With shunless destiny; aidless came off,\n"+
		"And with a sudden reinforcement struck\n"+
		"Corioli like a planet: now all's his:\n"+
		"When, by and by, the din of war gan pierce\n"+
		"His ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit\n"+
		"Re-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate,\n"+
		"And to the battle came he; where he did\n"+
		"Run reeking o'er the lives of men, as if\n"+
		"'Twere a perpetual spoil: and till we call'd\n"+
		"Both field and city ours, he never stood\n"+
		"To ease his breast with panting.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Worthy man!\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"He cannot but with measure fit the honours\n"+
		"Which we devise him.\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"Our spoils he kick'd at,\n"+
		"And look'd upon things precious as they were\n"+
		"The common muck of the world: he covets less\n"+
		"Than misery itself would give; rewards\n"+
		"His deeds with doing them, and is content\n"+
		"To spend the time to end it.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"He's right noble:\n"+
		"Let him be call'd for.\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"Call Coriolanus.\n"+
		"Officer\n"+
		"He doth appear.\n"+
		"Re-enter CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased\n"+
		"To make thee consul.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"I do owe them still\n"+
		"My life and services.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"It then remains\n"+
		"That you do speak to the people.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"I do beseech you,\n"+
		"Let me o'erleap that custom, for I cannot\n"+
		"Put on the gown, stand naked and entreat them,\n"+
		"For my wounds' sake, to give their suffrage: please you\n"+
		"That I may pass this doing.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Sir, the people\n"+
		"Must have their voices; neither will they bate\n"+
		"One jot of ceremony.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Put them not to't:\n"+
		"Pray you, go fit you to the custom and\n"+
		"Take to you, as your predecessors have,\n"+
		"Your honour with your form.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"It is apart\n"+
		"That I shall blush in acting, and might well\n"+
		"Be taken from the people.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"Mark you that?\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"To brag unto them, thus I did, and thus;\n"+
		"Show them the unaching scars which I should hide,\n"+
		"As if I had received them for the hire\n"+
		"Of their breath only!\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Do not stand upon't.\n"+
		"We recommend to you, tribunes of the people,\n"+
		"Our purpose to them: and to our noble consul\n"+
		"Wish we all joy and honour.\n"+
		"Senators\n"+
		"To Coriolanus come all joy and honour!\n"+
		"Flourish of cornets. Exeunt all but SICINIUS and BRUTUS\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"You see how he intends to use the people.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"May they perceive's intent! He will require them,\n"+
		"As if he did contemn what he requested\n"+
		"Should be in them to give.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"Come, we'll inform them\n"+
		"Of our proceedings here: on the marketplace,\n"+
		"I know, they do attend us.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. The same. The Forum.\n"+
		"Enter seven or eight Citizens\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"Once, if he do require our voices, we ought not to deny him.\n"+
		"Second Citizen\n"+
		"We may, sir, if we will.\n"+
		"Third Citizen\n"+
		"We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a\n"+
		"power that we have no power to do; for if he show us\n"+
		"his wounds and tell us his deeds, we are to put our\n"+
		"tongues into those wounds and speak for them; so, if\n"+
		"he tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell him\n"+
		"our noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is\n"+
		"monstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful,\n"+
		"were to make a monster of the multitude: of the\n"+
		"which we being members, should bring ourselves to be\n"+
		"monstrous members.\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"And to make us no better thought of, a little help\n"+
		"will serve; for once we stood up about the corn, he\n"+
		"himself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude.\n"+
		"Third Citizen\n"+
		"We have been called so of many; not that our heads\n"+
		"are some brown, some black, some auburn, some bald,\n"+
		"but that our wits are so diversely coloured: and\n"+
		"truly I think if all our wits were to issue out of\n"+
		"one skull, they would fly east, west, north, south,\n"+
		"and their consent of one direct way should be at\n"+
		"once to all the points o' the compass.\n"+
		"Second Citizen\n"+
		"Think you so? Which way do you judge my wit would\n"+
		"fly?\n"+
		"Third Citizen\n"+
		"Nay, your wit will not so soon out as another man's\n"+
		"will;'tis strongly wedged up in a block-head, but\n"+
		"if it were at liberty, 'twould, sure, southward.\n"+
		"Second Citizen\n"+
		"Why that way?\n"+
		"Third Citizen\n"+
		"To lose itself in a fog, where being three parts\n"+
		"melted away with rotten dews, the fourth would return\n"+
		"for conscience sake, to help to get thee a wife.\n"+
		"Second Citizen\n"+
		"You are never without your tricks: you may, you may.\n"+
		"Third Citizen\n"+
		"Are you all resolved to give your voices? But\n"+
		"that's no matter, the greater part carries it. I\n"+
		"say, if he would incline to the people, there was\n"+
		"never a worthier man.\n"+
		"Enter CORIOLANUS in a gown of humility, with MENENIUS\n"+
		"Here he comes, and in the gown of humility: mark his\n"+
		"behavior. We are not to stay all together, but to\n"+
		"come by him where he stands, by ones, by twos, and\n"+
		"by threes. He's to make his requests by\n"+
		"particulars; wherein every one of us has a single\n"+
		"honour, in giving him our own voices with our own\n"+
		"tongues: therefore follow me, and I direct you how\n"+
		"you shall go by him.\n"+
		"All\n"+
		"Content, content.\n"+
		"Exeunt Citizens\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"O sir, you are not right: have you not known\n"+
		"The worthiest men have done't?\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"What must I say?\n"+
		"'I Pray, sir'--Plague upon't! I cannot bring\n"+
		"My tongue to such a pace:--'Look, sir, my wounds!\n"+
		"I got them in my country's service, when\n"+
		"Some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran\n"+
		"From the noise of our own drums.'\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"O me, the gods!\n"+
		"You must not speak of that: you must desire them\n"+
		"To think upon you.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Think upon me! hang 'em!\n"+
		"I would they would forget me, like the virtues\n"+
		"Which our divines lose by 'em.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"You'll mar all:\n"+
		"I'll leave you: pray you, speak to 'em, I pray you,\n"+
		"In wholesome manner.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Bid them wash their faces\n"+
		"And keep their teeth clean.\n"+
		"Re-enter two of the Citizens\n"+
		"So, here comes a brace.\n"+
		"Re-enter a third Citizen\n"+
		"You know the cause, air, of my standing here.\n"+
		"Third Citizen\n"+
		"We do, sir; tell us what hath brought you to't.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Mine own desert.\n"+
		"Second Citizen\n"+
		"Your own desert!\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Ay, but not mine own desire.\n"+
		"Third Citizen\n"+
		"How not your own desire?\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"No, sir,'twas never my desire yet to trouble the\n"+
		"poor with begging.\n"+
		"Third Citizen\n"+
		"You must think, if we give you any thing, we hope to\n"+
		"gain by you.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Well then, I pray, your price o' the consulship?\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"The price is to ask it kindly.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Kindly! Sir, I pray, let me ha't: I have wounds to\n"+
		"show you, which shall be yours in private. Your\n"+
		"good voice, sir; what say you?\n"+
		"Second Citizen\n"+
		"You shall ha' it, worthy sir.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"A match, sir. There's in all two worthy voices\n"+
		"begged. I have your alms: adieu.\n"+
		"Third Citizen\n"+
		"But this is something odd.\n"+
		"Second Citizen\n"+
		"An 'twere to give again,--but 'tis no matter.\n"+
		"Exeunt the three Citizens\n"+
		"Re-enter two other Citizens\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your\n"+
		"voices that I may be consul, I have here the\n"+
		"customary gown.\n"+
		"Fourth Citizen\n"+
		"You have deserved nobly of your country, and you\n"+
		"have not deserved nobly.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Your enigma?\n"+
		"Fourth Citizen\n"+
		"You have been a scourge to her enemies, you have\n"+
		"been a rod to her friends; you have not indeed loved\n"+
		"the common people.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"You should account me the more virtuous that I have\n"+
		"not been common in my love. I will, sir, flatter my\n"+
		"sworn brother, the people, to earn a dearer\n"+
		"estimation of them; 'tis a condition they account\n"+
		"gentle: and since the wisdom of their choice is\n"+
		"rather to have my hat than my heart, I will practise\n"+
		"the insinuating nod and be off to them most\n"+
		"counterfeitly; that is, sir, I will counterfeit the\n"+
		"bewitchment of some popular man and give it\n"+
		"bountiful to the desirers. Therefore, beseech you,\n"+
		"I may be consul.\n"+
		"Fifth Citizen\n"+
		"We hope to find you our friend; and therefore give\n"+
		"you our voices heartily.\n"+
		"Fourth Citizen\n"+
		"You have received many wounds for your country.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"I will not seal your knowledge with showing them. I\n"+
		"will make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further.\n"+
		"Both Citizens\n"+
		"The gods give you joy, sir, heartily!\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Most sweet voices!\n"+
		"Better it is to die, better to starve,\n"+
		"Than crave the hire which first we do deserve.\n"+
		"Why in this woolvish toge should I stand here,\n"+
		"To beg of Hob and Dick, that do appear,\n"+
		"Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to't:\n"+
		"What custom wills, in all things should we do't,\n"+
		"The dust on antique time would lie unswept,\n"+
		"And mountainous error be too highly heapt\n"+
		"For truth to o'er-peer. Rather than fool it so,\n"+
		"Let the high office and the honour go\n"+
		"To one that would do thus. I am half through;\n"+
		"The one part suffer'd, the other will I do.\n"+
		"Re-enter three Citizens more\n"+
		"Here come more voices.\n"+
		"Your voices: for your voices I have fought;\n"+
		"Watch'd for your voices; for Your voices bear\n"+
		"Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six\n"+
		"I have seen and heard of; for your voices have\n"+
		"Done many things, some less, some more your voices:\n"+
		"Indeed I would be consul.\n"+
		"Sixth Citizen\n"+
		"He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest\n"+
		"man's voice.\n"+
		"Seventh Citizen\n"+
		"Therefore let him be consul: the gods give him joy,\n"+
		"and make him good friend to the people!\n"+
		"All Citizens\n"+
		"Amen, amen. God save thee, noble consul!\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Worthy voices!\n"+
		"Re-enter MENENIUS, with BRUTUS and SICINIUS\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"You have stood your limitation; and the tribunes\n"+
		"Endue you with the people's voice: remains\n"+
		"That, in the official marks invested, you\n"+
		"Anon do meet the senate.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Is this done?\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"The custom of request you have discharged:\n"+
		"The people do admit you, and are summon'd\n"+
		"To meet anon, upon your approbation.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Where? at the senate-house?\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"There, Coriolanus.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"May I change these garments?\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"You may, sir.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"That I'll straight do; and, knowing myself again,\n"+
		"Repair to the senate-house.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"I'll keep you company. Will you along?\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"We stay here for the people.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Fare you well.\n"+
		"Exeunt CORIOLANUS and MENENIUS\n"+
		"He has it now, and by his looks methink\n"+
		"'Tis warm at 's heart.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"With a proud heart he wore his humble weeds.\n"+
		"will you dismiss the people?\n"+
		"Re-enter Citizens\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"How now, my masters! have you chose this man?\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"He has our voices, sir.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.\n"+
		"Second Citizen\n"+
		"Amen, sir: to my poor unworthy notice,\n"+
		"He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.\n"+
		"Third Citizen\n"+
		"Certainly\n"+
		"He flouted us downright.\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"No,'tis his kind of speech: he did not mock us.\n"+
		"Second Citizen\n"+
		"Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says\n"+
		"He used us scornfully: he should have show'd us\n"+
		"His marks of merit, wounds received for's country.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Why, so he did, I am sure.\n"+
		"Citizens\n"+
		"No, no; no man saw 'em.\n"+
		"Third Citizen\n"+
		"He said he had wounds, which he could show\n"+
		"in private;\n"+
		"And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,\n"+
		"'I would be consul,' says he: 'aged custom,\n"+
		"But by your voices, will not so permit me;\n"+
		"Your voices therefore.' When we granted that,\n"+
		"Here was 'I thank you for your voices: thank you:\n"+
		"Your most sweet voices: now you have left\n"+
		"your voices,\n"+
		"I have no further with you.' Was not this mockery?\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Why either were you ignorant to see't,\n"+
		"Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness\n"+
		"To yield your voices?\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"Could you not have told him\n"+
		"As you were lesson'd, when he had no power,\n"+
		"But was a petty servant to the state,\n"+
		"He was your enemy, ever spake against\n"+
		"Your liberties and the charters that you bear\n"+
		"I' the body of the weal; and now, arriving\n"+
		"A place of potency and sway o' the state,\n"+
		"If he should still malignantly remain\n"+
		"Fast foe to the plebeii, your voices might\n"+
		"Be curses to yourselves? You should have said\n"+
		"That as his worthy deeds did claim no less\n"+
		"Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature\n"+
		"Would think upon you for your voices and\n"+
		"Translate his malice towards you into love,\n"+
		"Standing your friendly lord.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Thus to have said,\n"+
		"As you were fore-advised, had touch'd his spirit\n"+
		"And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd\n"+
		"Either his gracious promise, which you might,\n"+
		"As cause had call'd you up, have held him to\n"+
		"Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature,\n"+
		"Which easily endures not article\n"+
		"Tying him to aught; so putting him to rage,\n"+
		"You should have ta'en the advantage of his choler\n"+
		"And pass'd him unelected.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"Did you perceive\n"+
		"He did solicit you in free contempt\n"+
		"When he did need your loves, and do you think\n"+
		"That his contempt shall not be bruising to you,\n"+
		"When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies\n"+
		"No heart among you? or had you tongues to cry\n"+
		"Against the rectorship of judgment?\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Have you\n"+
		"Ere now denied the asker? and now again\n"+
		"Of him that did not ask, but mock, bestow\n"+
		"Your sued-for tongues?\n"+
		"Third Citizen\n"+
		"He's not confirm'd; we may deny him yet.\n"+
		"Second Citizen\n"+
		"And will deny him:\n"+
		"I'll have five hundred voices of that sound.\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"I twice five hundred and their friends to piece 'em.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends,\n"+
		"They have chose a consul that will from them take\n"+
		"Their liberties; make them of no more voice\n"+
		"Than dogs that are as often beat for barking\n"+
		"As therefore kept to do so.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Let them assemble,\n"+
		"And on a safer judgment all revoke\n"+
		"Your ignorant election; enforce his pride,\n"+
		"And his old hate unto you; besides, forget not\n"+
		"With what contempt he wore the humble weed,\n"+
		"How in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves,\n"+
		"Thinking upon his services, took from you\n"+
		"The apprehension of his present portance,\n"+
		"Which most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion\n"+
		"After the inveterate hate he bears you.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"Lay\n"+
		"A fault on us, your tribunes; that we laboured,\n"+
		"No impediment between, but that you must\n"+
		"Cast your election on him.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Say, you chose him\n"+
		"More after our commandment than as guided\n"+
		"By your own true affections, and that your minds,\n"+
		"Preoccupied with what you rather must do\n"+
		"Than what you should, made you against the grain\n"+
		"To voice him consul: lay the fault on us.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you.\n"+
		"How youngly he began to serve his country,\n"+
		"How long continued, and what stock he springs of,\n"+
		"The noble house o' the Marcians, from whence came\n"+
		"That Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter's son,\n"+
		"Who, after great Hostilius, here was king;\n"+
		"Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,\n"+
		"That our beat water brought by conduits hither;\n"+
		"And [Censorinus,] nobly named so,\n"+
		"Twice being [by the people chosen] censor,\n"+
		"Was his great ancestor.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"One thus descended,\n"+
		"That hath beside well in his person wrought\n"+
		"To be set high in place, we did commend\n"+
		"To your remembrances: but you have found,\n"+
		"Scaling his present bearing with his past,\n"+
		"That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke\n"+
		"Your sudden approbation.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"Say, you ne'er had done't--\n"+
		"Harp on that still--but by our putting on;\n"+
		"And presently, when you have drawn your number,\n"+
		"Repair to the Capitol.\n"+
		"All\n"+
		"We will so: almost all\n"+
		"Repent in their election.\n"+
		"Exeunt Citizens\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"Let them go on;\n"+
		"This mutiny were better put in hazard,\n"+
		"Than stay, past doubt, for greater:\n"+
		"If, as his nature is, he fall in rage\n"+
		"With their refusal, both observe and answer\n"+
		"The vantage of his anger.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"To the Capitol, come:\n"+
		"We will be there before the stream o' the people;\n"+
		"And this shall seem, as partly 'tis, their own,\n"+
		"Which we have goaded onward.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT III\n"+
		"SCENE I. Rome. A street.\n"+
		"Cornets. Enter CORIOLANUS, MENENIUS, all the Gentry, COMINIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, and other Senators\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Tullus Aufidius then had made new head?\n"+
		"LARTIUS\n"+
		"He had, my lord; and that it was which caused\n"+
		"Our swifter composition.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"So then the Volsces stand but as at first,\n"+
		"Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road.\n"+
		"Upon's again.\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"They are worn, lord consul, so,\n"+
		"That we shall hardly in our ages see\n"+
		"Their banners wave again.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Saw you Aufidius?\n"+
		"LARTIUS\n"+
		"On safe-guard he came to me; and did curse\n"+
		"Against the Volsces, for they had so vilely\n"+
		"Yielded the town: he is retired to Antium.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Spoke he of me?\n"+
		"LARTIUS\n"+
		"He did, my lord.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"How? what?\n"+
		"LARTIUS\n"+
		"How often he had met you, sword to sword;\n"+
		"That of all things upon the earth he hated\n"+
		"Your person most, that he would pawn his fortunes\n"+
		"To hopeless restitution, so he might\n"+
		"Be call'd your vanquisher.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"At Antium lives he?\n"+
		"LARTIUS\n"+
		"At Antium.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"I wish I had a cause to seek him there,\n"+
		"To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.\n"+
		"Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS\n"+
		"Behold, these are the tribunes of the people,\n"+
		"The tongues o' the common mouth: I do despise them;\n"+
		"For they do prank them in authority,\n"+
		"Against all noble sufferance.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Pass no further.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Ha! what is that?\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"It will be dangerous to go on: no further.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"What makes this change?\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"The matter?\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common?\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"Cominius, no.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+

		"Stop,\n"+
		"Or all will fall in broil.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Are these your herd?\n"+
		"Must these have voices, that can yield them now\n"+
		"And straight disclaim their tongues? What are\n"+
		"your offices?\n"+
		"You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?\n"+
		"Have you not set them on?\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Be calm, be calm.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"It is a purposed thing, and grows by plot,\n"+
		"To curb the will of the nobility:\n"+
		"Suffer't, and live with such as cannot rule\n"+
		"Nor ever will be ruled.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"Call't not a plot:\n"+
		"The people cry you mock'd them, and of late,\n"+
		"When corn was given them gratis, you repined;\n"+
		"Scandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd them\n"+
		"Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Why, this was known before.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"Not to them all.\n"+

		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"You are like to do such business.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"Not unlike,\n"+
		"Each way, to better yours.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds,\n"+
		"Let me deserve so ill as you, and make me\n"+
		"Your fellow tribune.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"You show too much of that\n"+
		"For which the people stir: if you will pass\n"+
		"To where you are bound, you must inquire your way,\n"+

		"Not now, not now.\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"Not in this heat, sir, now.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Now, as I live, I will. My nobler friends,\n"+
		"I crave their pardons:\n"+
		"For the mutable, rank-scented many, let them\n"+
		"Regard me as I do not flatter, and\n"+
		"Therein behold themselves: I say again,\n"+
		"In soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senate\n"+
		"The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,\n"+
		"Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd,\n"+

		"By mingling them with us, the honour'd number,\n"+
		"Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that\n"+

		"First Senator\n"+
		"No more words, we beseech you.\n"+

		"How! no more!\n"+
		"As for my country I have shed my blood,\n"+
		"Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs\n"+
		"Coin words till their decay against those measles,\n"+
		"Which we disdain should tatter us, yet sought\n"+
		"The very way to catch them.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"You speak o' the people,\n"+
		"As if you were a god to punish, not\n"+

		"'Twere well\n"+
		"We let the people know't.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+

		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Choler!\n"+
		"Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,\n"+

		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"It is a mind\n"+
		"That shall remain a poison where it is,\n"+
		"Not poison any further.\n"+

		"His absolute 'shall'?\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"'Twas from the canon.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"'Shall'!\n"+
		"O good but most unwise patricians! why,\n"+
		"You grave but reckless senators, have you thus\n"+
		"Given Hydra here to choose an officer,\n"+
		"That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but\n"+
		"The horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not spirit\n"+
		"To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,\n"+
		"And make your channel his? If he have power\n"+
		"Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake\n"+
		"Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,\n"+
		"Be not as common fools; if you are not,\n"+
		"Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,\n"+
		"If they be senators: and they are no less,\n"+
		"When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste\n"+
		"Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,\n"+
		"And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'\n"+
		"His popular 'shall' against a graver bench\n"+
		"Than ever frown in Greece. By Jove himself!\n"+
		"It makes the consuls base: and my soul aches\n"+
		"To know, when two authorities are up,\n"+
		"Neither supreme, how soon confusion\n"+
		"May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take\n"+
		"The one by the other.\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"Well, on to the market-place.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Whoever gave that counsel, to give forth\n"+
		"The corn o' the storehouse gratis, as 'twas used\n"+
		"Sometime in Greece,--\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Well, well, no more of that.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Though there the people had more absolute power,\n"+
		"I say, they nourish'd disobedience, fed\n"+
		"The ruin of the state.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"Why, shall the people give\n"+
		"One that speaks thus their voice?\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"I'll give my reasons,\n"+
		"More worthier than their voices. They know the corn\n"+
		"Was not our recompense, resting well assured\n"+
		"That ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war,\n"+
		"Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,\n"+
		"They would not thread the gates. This kind of service\n"+
		"Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' the war\n"+
		"Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd\n"+
		"Most valour, spoke not for them: the accusation\n"+
		"Which they have often made against the senate,\n"+
		"All cause unborn, could never be the motive\n"+
		"Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?\n"+
		"How shall this bisson multitude digest\n"+
		"The senate's courtesy? Let deeds express\n"+
		"What's like to be their words: 'we did request it;\n"+
		"We are the greater poll, and in true fear\n"+
		"They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase\n"+
		"The nature of our seats and make the rabble\n"+
		"Call our cares fears; which will in time\n"+
		"Break ope the locks o' the senate and bring in\n"+
		"The crows to peck the eagles.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Come, enough.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"Enough, with over-measure.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"No, take more:\n"+
		"What may be sworn by, both divine and human,\n"+
		"Seal what I end withal! This double worship,\n"+
		"Where one part does disdain with cause, the other\n"+
		"Insult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom,\n"+
		"Cannot conclude but by the yea and no\n"+
		"Of general ignorance,--it must omit\n"+
		"Real necessities, and give way the while\n"+
		"To unstable slightness: purpose so barr'd,\n"+
		"it follows,\n"+
		"Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you,--\n"+
		"You that will be less fearful than discreet,\n"+
		"That love the fundamental part of state\n"+
		"More than you doubt the change on't, that prefer\n"+
		"A noble life before a long, and wish\n"+
		"To jump a body with a dangerous physic\n"+
		"That's sure of death without it, at once pluck out\n"+
		"The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick\n"+
		"The sweet which is their poison: your dishonour\n"+
		"Mangles true judgment and bereaves the state\n"+
		"Of that integrity which should become't,\n"+
		"Not having the power to do the good it would,\n"+
		"For the in which doth control't.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"Has said enough.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer\n"+
		"As traitors do.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!\n"+
		"What should the people do with these bald tribunes?\n"+
		"On whom depending, their obedience fails\n"+
		"To the greater bench: in a rebellion,\n"+
		"When what's not meet, but what must be, was law,\n"+
		"Then were they chosen: in a better hour,\n"+
		"Let what is meet be said it must be meet,\n"+
		"And throw their power i' the dust.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"Manifest treason!\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"This a consul? no.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"The aediles, ho!\n"+
		"Enter an AEdile\n"+
		"Let him be apprehended.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Go, call the people:\n"+
		"Exit AEdile\n"+
		"in whose name myself\n"+
		"Attach thee as a traitorous innovator,\n"+
		"A foe to the public weal: obey, I charge thee,\n"+
		"And follow to thine answer.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Hence, old goat!\n"+
		"Senators, & C We'll surety him.\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"Aged sir, hands off.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Hence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones\n"+
		"Out of thy garments.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Help, ye citizens!\n"+
		"Enter a rabble of Citizens (Plebeians), with the AEdiles\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"On both sides more respect.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Here's he that would take from you all your power.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"Seize him, AEdiles!\n"+
		"Citizens\n"+
		"Down with him! down with him!\n"+
		"Senators, & C Weapons, weapons, weapons!\n"+
		"They all bustle about CORIOLANUS, crying\n"+
		"'Tribunes!' 'Patricians!' 'Citizens!' 'What, ho!'\n"+
		"'Sicinius!' 'Brutus!' 'Coriolanus!' 'Citizens!'\n"+
		"'Peace, peace, peace!' 'Stay, hold, peace!'\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"What is about to be? I am out of breath;\n"+
		"Confusion's near; I cannot speak. You, tribunes\n"+
		"To the people! Coriolanus, patience!\n"+
		"Speak, good Sicinius.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Hear me, people; peace!\n"+
		"Citizens\n"+
		"Let's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, speak.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"You are at point to lose your liberties:\n"+
		"Marcius would have all from you; Marcius,\n"+
		"Whom late you have named for consul.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Fie, fie, fie!\n"+
		"This is the way to kindle, not to quench.\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"To unbuild the city and to lay all flat.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"What is the city but the people?\n"+
		"Citizens\n"+
		"True,\n"+
		"The people are the city.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"By the consent of all, we were establish'd\n"+
		"The people's magistrates.\n"+
		"Citizens\n"+
		"You so remain.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"And so are like to do.\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"That is the way to lay the city flat;\n"+
		"To bring the roof to the foundation,\n"+
		"And bury all, which yet distinctly ranges,\n"+
		"In heaps and piles of ruin.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"This deserves death.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"Or let us stand to our authority,\n"+
		"Or let us lose it. We do here pronounce,\n"+
		"Upon the part o' the people, in whose power\n"+
		"We were elected theirs, Marcius is worthy\n"+
		"Of present death.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Therefore lay hold of him;\n"+
		"Bear him to the rock Tarpeian, and from thence\n"+
		"Into destruction cast him.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"AEdiles, seize him!\n"+
		"Citizens\n"+
		"Yield, Marcius, yield!\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Hear me one word;\n"+
		"Beseech you, tribunes, hear me but a word.\n"+
		"AEdile\n"+
		"Peace, peace!\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"[To BRUTUS] Be that you seem, truly your\n"+
		"country's friend,\n"+
		"And temperately proceed to what you would\n"+
		"Thus violently redress.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"Sir, those cold ways,\n"+
		"That seem like prudent helps, are very poisonous\n"+
		"Where the disease is violent. Lay hands upon him,\n"+
		"And bear him to the rock.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"No, I'll die here.\n"+
		"Drawing his sword\n"+
		"There's some among you have beheld me fighting:\n"+
		"Come, try upon yourselves what you have seen me.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Down with that sword! Tribunes, withdraw awhile.\n"+

		"Lay hands upon him.\n"+

		"First Senator\n"+
		"The gods forbid!\n"+
		"I prithee, noble friend, home to thy house;\n"+
		"Leave us to cure this cause.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"For 'tis a sore upon us,\n"+
		"You cannot tent yourself: be gone, beseech you.\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"Come, sir, along with us.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"I would they were barbarians--as they are,\n"+
		"Though in Rome litter'd--not Romans--as they are not,\n"+
		"Though calved i' the porch o' the Capitol--\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Be gone;\n"+
		"Put not your worthy rage into your tongue;\n"+
		"One time will owe another.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"On fair ground\n"+
		"I could beat forty of them.\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"I could myself\n"+
		"Take up a brace o' the best of them; yea, the\n"+
		"two tribunes:\n"+
		"But now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic;\n"+
		"And manhood is call'd foolery, when it stands\n"+
		"Against a falling fabric. Will you hence,\n"+
		"Before the tag return? whose rage doth rend\n"+
		"Like interrupted waters and o'erbear\n"+
		"What they are used to bear.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Pray you, be gone:\n"+
		"I'll try whether my old wit be in request\n"+
		"With those that have but little: this must be patch'd\n"+
		"With cloth of any colour.\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"Nay, come away.\n"+
		"Exeunt CORIOLANUS, COMINIUS, and others\n"+
		"A Patrician\n"+
		"This man has marr'd his fortune.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"His nature is too noble for the world:\n"+
		"He would not flatter Neptune for his trident,\n"+
		"Or Jove for's power to thunder. His heart's his mouth:\n"+
		"What his breast forges, that his tongue must vent;\n"+
		"And, being angry, does forget that ever\n"+
		"He heard the name of death.\n"+
		"A noise within\n"+
		"Here's goodly work!\n"+
		"Second Patrician\n"+
		"I would they were abed!\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"I would they were in Tiber! What the vengeance!\n"+
		"Could he not speak 'em fair?\n"+
		"Re-enter BRUTUS and SICINIUS, with the rabble\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Where is this viper\n"+
		"That would depopulate the city and\n"+
		"Be every man himself?\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"You worthy tribunes,--\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock\n"+
		"With rigorous hands: he hath resisted law,\n"+
		"And therefore law shall scorn him further trial\n"+
		"Than the severity of the public power\n"+
		"Which he so sets at nought.\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"He shall well know\n"+
		"The noble tribunes are the people's mouths,\n"+
		"And we their hands.\n"+
		"Citizens\n"+
		"He shall, sure on't.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Sir, sir,--\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Peace!\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Do not cry havoc, where you should but hunt\n"+
		"With modest warrant.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Sir, how comes't that you\n"+
		"Have holp to make this rescue?\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Hear me speak:\n"+
		"As I do know the consul's worthiness,\n"+
		"So can I name his faults,--\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Consul! what consul?\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"The consul Coriolanus.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"He consul!\n"+
		"Citizens\n"+
		"No, no, no, no, no.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"If, by the tribunes' leave, and yours, good people,\n"+
		"I may be heard, I would crave a word or two;\n"+
		"The which shall turn you to no further harm\n"+
		"Than so much loss of time.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Speak briefly then;\n"+
		"For we are peremptory to dispatch\n"+
		"This viperous traitor: to eject him hence\n"+
		"Were but one danger, and to keep him here\n"+
		"Our certain death: therefore it is decreed\n"+
		"He dies to-night.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Now the good gods forbid\n"+
		"That our renowned Rome, whose gratitude\n"+
		"Towards her deserved children is enroll'd\n"+
		"In Jove's own book, like an unnatural dam\n"+
		"Should now eat up her own!\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"He's a disease that must be cut away.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"O, he's a limb that has but a disease;\n"+
		"Mortal, to cut it off; to cure it, easy.\n"+
		"What has he done to Rome that's worthy death?\n"+
		"Killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost--\n"+
		"Which, I dare vouch, is more than that he hath,\n"+
		"By many an ounce--he dropp'd it for his country;\n"+
		"And what is left, to lose it by his country,\n"+
		"Were to us all, that do't and suffer it,\n"+
		"A brand to the end o' the world.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"This is clean kam.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"Merely awry: when he did love his country,\n"+
		"It honour'd him.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"The service of the foot\n"+
		"Being once gangrened, is not then respected\n"+
		"For what before it was.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"We'll hear no more.\n"+
		"Pursue him to his house, and pluck him thence:\n"+
		"Lest his infection, being of catching nature,\n"+
		"Spread further.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"One word more, one word.\n"+
		"This tiger-footed rage, when it shall find\n"+
		"The harm of unscann'd swiftness, will too late\n"+
		"Tie leaden pounds to's heels. Proceed by process;\n"+
		"Lest parties, as he is beloved, break out,\n"+
		"And sack great Rome with Romans.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"If it were so,--\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"What do ye talk?\n"+
		"Have we not had a taste of his obedience?\n"+
		"Our aediles smote? ourselves resisted? Come.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Consider this: he has been bred i' the wars\n"+
		"Since he could draw a sword, and is ill school'd\n"+
		"In bolted language; meal and bran together\n"+
		"He throws without distinction. Give me leave,\n"+
		"I'll go to him, and undertake to bring him\n"+
		"Where he shall answer, by a lawful form,\n"+
		"In peace, to his utmost peril.\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"Noble tribunes,\n"+
		"It is the humane way: the other course\n"+
		"Will prove too bloody, and the end of it\n"+
		"Unknown to the beginning.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Noble Menenius,\n"+
		"Be you then as the people's officer.\n"+
		"Masters, lay down your weapons.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"Go not home.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Meet on the market-place. We'll attend you there:\n"+
		"Where, if you bring not Marcius, we'll proceed\n"+
		"In our first way.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"I'll bring him to you.\n"+
		"To the Senators\n"+
		"Let me desire your company: he must come,\n"+
		"Or what is worst will follow.\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"Pray you, let's to him.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. A room in CORIOLANUS'S house.\n"+
		"Enter CORIOLANUS with Patricians\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Let them puff all about mine ears, present me\n"+

		"That the precipitation might down stretch\n"+
		"Below the beam of sight, yet will I still\n"+
		"Be thus to them.\n"+
		"A Patrician\n"+
		"You do the nobler.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"I muse my mother\n"+
		"Does not approve me further, who was wont\n"+
		"To call them woollen vassals, things created\n"+
		"To buy and sell with groats, to show bare heads\n"+
		"In congregations, to yawn, be still and wonder,\n"+
		"When one but of my ordinance stood up\n"+

		"O, sir, sir, sir,\n"+
		"I would have had you put your power well on,\n"+

		"Let go.\n"+

		"You might have been enough the man you are,\n"+

		"You had not show'd them how ye were disposed\n"+
		"Ere they lack'd power to cross you.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Let them hang.\n"+
		"A Patrician\n"+
		"Ay, and burn too.\n"+
		"Enter MENENIUS and Senators\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Come, come, you have been too rough, something\n"+
		"too rough;\n"+
		"You must return and mend it.\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"There's no remedy;\n"+

		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"Pray, be counsell'd:\n"+

		"Well said, noble woman?\n"+
		"Before he should thus stoop to the herd, but that\n"+
		"The violent fit o' the time craves it as physic\n"+
		"For the whole state, I would put mine armour on,\n"+

		"Must I then do't to them?\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"You are too absolute;\n"+
		"Though therein you can never be too noble,\n"+
		"But when extremities speak. I have heard you say,\n"+
		"Honour and policy, like unsever'd friends,\n"+
		"I' the war do grow together: grant that, and tell me,\n"+
		"In peace what each of them by the other lose,\n"+
		"That they combine not there.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Tush, tush!\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"A good demand.\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"If it be honour in your wars to seem\n"+
		"The same you are not, which, for your best ends,\n"+
		"You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse,\n"+
		"That it shall hold companionship in peace\n"+
		"With honour, as in war, since that to both\n"+
		"It stands in like request?\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Why force you this?\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"Because that now it lies you on to speak\n"+
		"To the people; not by your own instruction,\n"+
		"Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you,\n"+
		"But with such words that are but rooted in\n"+
		"Your tongue, though but bastards and syllables\n"+
		"Of no allowance to your bosom's truth.\n"+
		"Now, this no more dishonours you at all\n"+
		"Than to take in a town with gentle words,\n"+
		"Which else would put you to your fortune and\n"+
		"The hazard of much blood.\n"+
		"I would dissemble with my nature where\n"+
		"My fortunes and my friends at stake required\n"+
		"I should do so in honour: I am in this,\n"+
		"Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;\n"+
		"And you will rather show our general louts\n"+
		"How you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em,\n"+
		"For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard\n"+
		"Of what that want might ruin.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Noble lady!\n"+
		"Come, go with us; speak fair: you may salve so,\n"+
		"Not what is dangerous present, but the loss\n"+
		"Of what is past.\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"I prithee now, my son,\n"+
		"Go to them, with this bonnet in thy hand;\n"+
		"And thus far having stretch'd it--here be with them--\n"+
		"Thy knee bussing the stones--for in such business\n"+
		"Action is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant\n"+
		"More learned than the ears--waving thy head,\n"+
		"Which often, thus, correcting thy stout heart,\n"+
		"Now humble as the ripest mulberry\n"+
		"That will not hold the handling: or say to them,\n"+
		"Thou art their soldier, and being bred in broils\n"+
		"Hast not the soft way which, thou dost confess,\n"+
		"Were fit for thee to use as they to claim,\n"+
		"In asking their good loves, but thou wilt frame\n"+
		"Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far\n"+
		"As thou hast power and person.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"This but done,\n"+
		"Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;\n"+
		"For they have pardons, being ask'd, as free\n"+
		"As words to little purpose.\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"Prithee now,\n"+
		"Go, and be ruled: although I know thou hadst rather\n"+
		"Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf\n"+
		"Than flatter him in a bower. Here is Cominius.\n"+
		"Enter COMINIUS\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"I have been i' the market-place; and, sir,'tis fit\n"+
		"You make strong party, or defend yourself\n"+
		"By calmness or by absence: all's in anger.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Only fair speech.\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"I think 'twill serve, if he\n"+
		"Can thereto frame his spirit.\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"He must, and will\n"+
		"Prithee now, say you will, and go about it.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Must I go show them my unbarbed sconce?\n"+
		"Must I with base tongue give my noble heart\n"+
		"A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't:\n"+
		"Yet, were there but this single plot to lose,\n"+
		"This mould of Marcius, they to dust should grind it\n"+
		"And throw't against the wind. To the market-place!\n"+
		"You have put me now to such a part which never\n"+
		"I shall discharge to the life.\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"Come, come, we'll prompt you.\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"I prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast said\n"+
		"My praises made thee first a soldier, so,\n"+
		"To have my praise for this, perform a part\n"+
		"Thou hast not done before.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Well, I must do't:\n"+
		"Away, my disposition, and possess me\n"+
		"Some harlot's spirit! my throat of war be turn'd,\n"+
		"Which quired with my drum, into a pipe\n"+
		"Small as an eunuch, or the virgin voice\n"+
		"That babies lulls asleep! the smiles of knaves\n"+
		"Tent in my cheeks, and schoolboys' tears take up\n"+
		"The glasses of my sight! a beggar's tongue\n"+
		"Make motion through my lips, and my arm'd knees,\n"+
		"Who bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like his\n"+
		"That hath received an alms! I will not do't,\n"+
		"Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth\n"+
		"And by my body's action teach my mind\n"+
		"A most inherent baseness.\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"At thy choice, then:\n"+
		"To beg of thee, it is my more dishonour\n"+
		"Than thou of them. Come all to ruin; let\n"+
		"Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear\n"+
		"Thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death\n"+
		"With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list\n"+
		"Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me,\n"+
		"But owe thy pride thyself.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Pray, be content:\n"+
		"Mother, I am going to the market-place;\n"+
		"Chide me no more. I'll mountebank their loves,\n"+
		"Cog their hearts from them, and come home beloved\n"+
		"Of all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going:\n"+
		"Commend me to my wife. I'll return consul;\n"+
		"Or never trust to what my tongue can do\n"+
		"I' the way of flattery further.\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"Do your will.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"Away! the tribunes do attend you: arm yourself\n"+
		"To answer mildly; for they are prepared\n"+
		"With accusations, as I hear, more strong\n"+
		"Than are upon you yet.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"The word is 'mildly.' Pray you, let us go:\n"+
		"Let them accuse me by invention, I\n"+
		"Will answer in mine honour.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Ay, but mildly.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Well, mildly be it then. Mildly!\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. The same. The Forum.\n"+
		"Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"In this point charge him home, that he affects\n"+
		"Tyrannical power: if he evade us there,\n"+
		"Enforce him with his envy to the people,\n"+
		"And that the spoil got on the Antiates\n"+
		"Was ne'er distributed.\n"+
		"Enter an AEdile\n"+
		"What, will he come?\n"+
		"AEdile\n"+
		"He's coming.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"How accompanied?\n"+
		"AEdile\n"+
		"With old Menenius, and those senators\n"+
		"That always favour'd him.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Have you a catalogue\n"+
		"Of all the voices that we have procured\n"+
		"Set down by the poll?\n"+
		"AEdile\n"+
		"I have; 'tis ready.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Have you collected them by tribes?\n"+
		"AEdile\n"+
		"I have.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Assemble presently the people hither;\n"+
		"And when they bear me say 'It shall be so\n"+
		"I' the right and strength o' the commons,' be it either\n"+
		"For death, for fine, or banishment, then let them\n"+
		"If I say fine, cry 'Fine;' if death, cry 'Death.'\n"+
		"Insisting on the old prerogative\n"+
		"And power i' the truth o' the cause.\n"+
		"AEdile\n"+
		"I shall inform them.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"And when such time they have begun to cry,\n"+
		"Let them not cease, but with a din confused\n"+
		"Enforce the present execution\n"+
		"Of what we chance to sentence.\n"+
		"AEdile\n"+
		"Very well.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Make them be strong and ready for this hint,\n"+
		"When we shall hap to give 't them.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"Go about it.\n"+
		"Exit AEdile\n"+
		"Put him to choler straight: he hath been used\n"+
		"Ever to conquer, and to have his worth\n"+
		"Of contradiction: being once chafed, he cannot\n"+
		"Be rein'd again to temperance; then he speaks\n"+
		"What's in his heart; and that is there which looks\n"+
		"With us to break his neck.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Well, here he comes.\n"+
		"Enter CORIOLANUS, MENENIUS, and COMINIUS, with Senators and Patricians\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Calmly, I do beseech you.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Ay, as an ostler, that for the poorest piece\n"+
		"Will bear the knave by the volume. The honour'd gods\n"+
		"Keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice\n"+
		"Supplied with worthy men! plant love among 's!\n"+
		"Throng our large temples with the shows of peace,\n"+
		"And not our streets with war!\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"Amen, amen.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"A noble wish.\n"+
		"Re-enter AEdile, with Citizens\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Draw near, ye people.\n"+
		"AEdile\n"+
		"List to your tribunes. Audience: peace, I say!\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"First, hear me speak.\n"+
		"Both Tribunes\n"+
		"Well, say. Peace, ho!\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Shall I be charged no further than this present?\n"+
		"Must all determine here?\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"I do demand,\n"+
		"If you submit you to the people's voices,\n"+
		"Allow their officers and are content\n"+
		"To suffer lawful censure for such faults\n"+
		"As shall be proved upon you?\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"I am content.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Lo, citizens, he says he is content:\n"+
		"The warlike service he has done, consider; think\n"+
		"Upon the wounds his body bears, which show\n"+
		"Like graves i' the holy churchyard.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Scratches with briers,\n"+
		"Scars to move laughter only.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Consider further,\n"+
		"That when he speaks not like a citizen,\n"+
		"You find him like a soldier: do not take\n"+
		"His rougher accents for malicious sounds,\n"+
		"But, as I say, such as become a soldier,\n"+
		"Rather than envy you.\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"Well, well, no more.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"What is the matter\n"+
		"That being pass'd for consul with full voice,\n"+
		"I am so dishonour'd that the very hour\n"+
		"You take it off again?\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Answer to us.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Say, then: 'tis true, I ought so.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"We charge you, that you have contrived to take\n"+
		"From Rome all season'd office and to wind\n"+
		"Yourself into a power tyrannical;\n"+
		"For which you are a traitor to the people.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"How! traitor!\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Nay, temperately; your promise.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"The fires i' the lowest hell fold-in the people!\n"+
		"Call me their traitor! Thou injurious tribune!\n"+
		"Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths,\n"+
		"In thy hand clutch'd as many millions, in\n"+
		"Thy lying tongue both numbers, I would say\n"+
		"'Thou liest' unto thee with a voice as free\n"+
		"As I do pray the gods.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Mark you this, people?\n"+
		"Citizens\n"+
		"To the rock, to the rock with him!\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Peace!\n"+
		"We need not put new matter to his charge:\n"+
		"What you have seen him do and heard him speak,\n"+
		"Beating your officers, cursing yourselves,\n"+
		"Opposing laws with strokes and here defying\n"+
		"Those whose great power must try him; even this,\n"+
		"So criminal and in such capital kind,\n"+
		"Deserves the extremest death.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"But since he hath\n"+
		"Served well for Rome,--\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"What do you prate of service?\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"I talk of that, that know it.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"You?\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Is this the promise that you made your mother?\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"Know, I pray you,--\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"I know no further:\n"+
		"Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death,\n"+
		"Vagabond exile, raying, pent to linger\n"+
		"But with a grain a day, I would not buy\n"+
		"Their mercy at the price of one fair word;\n"+
		"Nor cheque my courage for what they can give,\n"+
		"To have't with saying 'Good morrow.'\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"For that he has,\n"+
		"As much as in him lies, from time to time\n"+
		"Envied against the people, seeking means\n"+
		"To pluck away their power, as now at last\n"+
		"Given hostile strokes, and that not in the presence\n"+
		"Of dreaded justice, but on the ministers\n"+
		"That do distribute it; in the name o' the people\n"+
		"And in the power of us the tribunes, we,\n"+
		"Even from this instant, banish him our city,\n"+
		"In peril of precipitation\n"+
		"From off the rock Tarpeian never more\n"+
		"To enter our Rome gates: i' the people's name,\n"+
		"I say it shall be so.\n"+
		"Citizens\n"+
		"It shall be so, it shall be so; let him away:\n"+
		"He's banish'd, and it shall be so.\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"Hear me, my masters, and my common friends,--\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"He's sentenced; no more hearing.\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"Let me speak:\n"+
		"I have been consul, and can show for Rome\n"+
		"Her enemies' marks upon me. I do love\n"+
		"My country's good with a respect more tender,\n"+
		"More holy and profound, than mine own life,\n"+
		"My dear wife's estimate, her womb's increase,\n"+
		"And treasure of my loins; then if I would\n"+
		"Speak that,--\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"We know your drift: speak what?\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"There's no more to be said, but he is banish'd,\n"+
		"As enemy to the people and his country:\n"+
		"It shall be so.\n"+
		"Citizens\n"+
		"It shall be so, it shall be so.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"You common cry of curs! whose breath I hate\n"+
		"As reek o' the rotten fens, whose loves I prize\n"+
		"As the dead carcasses of unburied men\n"+
		"That do corrupt my air, I banish you;\n"+
		"And here remain with your uncertainty!\n"+
		"Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts!\n"+
		"Your enemies, with nodding of their plumes,\n"+
		"Fan you into despair! Have the power still\n"+
		"To banish your defenders; till at length\n"+
		"Your ignorance, which finds not till it feels,\n"+
		"Making not reservation of yourselves,\n"+
		"Still your own foes, deliver you as most\n"+
		"Abated captives to some nation\n"+
		"That won you without blows! Despising,\n"+
		"For you, the city, thus I turn my back:\n"+
		"There is a world elsewhere.\n"+
		"Exeunt CORIOLANUS, COMINIUS, MENENIUS, Senators, and Patricians\n"+
		"AEdile\n"+
		"The people's enemy is gone, is gone!\n"+
		"Citizens\n"+
		"Our enemy is banish'd! he is gone! Hoo! hoo!\n"+
		"Shouting, and throwing up their caps\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Go, see him out at gates, and follow him,\n"+
		"As he hath followed you, with all despite;\n"+
		"Give him deserved vexation. Let a guard\n"+
		"Attend us through the city.\n"+
		"Citizens\n"+
		"Come, come; let's see him out at gates; come.\n"+
		"The gods preserve our noble tribunes! Come.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT IV\n"+
		"SCENE I. Rome. Before a gate of the city.\n"+
		"Enter CORIOLANUS, VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, MENENIUS, COMINIUS, with the young Nobility of Rome\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Come, leave your tears: a brief farewell: the beast\n"+
		"With many heads butts me away. Nay, mother,\n"+
		"Where is your ancient courage? you were used\n"+
		"To say extremity was the trier of spirits;\n"+
		"That common chances common men could bear;\n"+
		"That when the sea was calm all boats alike\n"+
		"Show'd mastership in floating; fortune's blows,\n"+
		"When most struck home, being gentle wounded, craves\n"+
		"A noble cunning: you were used to load me\n"+
		"With precepts that would make invincible\n"+
		"The heart that conn'd them.\n"+
		"VIRGILIA\n"+
		"O heavens! O heavens!\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Nay! prithee, woman,--\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome,\n"+
		"And occupations perish!\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"What, what, what!\n"+
		"I shall be loved when I am lack'd. Nay, mother.\n"+
		"Resume that spirit, when you were wont to say,\n"+
		"If you had been the wife of Hercules,\n"+
		"Six of his labours you'ld have done, and saved\n"+
		"Your husband so much sweat. Cominius,\n"+
		"Droop not; adieu. Farewell, my wife, my mother:\n"+
		"I'll do well yet. Thou old and true Menenius,\n"+
		"Thy tears are salter than a younger man's,\n"+
		"And venomous to thine eyes. My sometime general,\n"+
		"I have seen thee stem, and thou hast oft beheld\n"+
		"Heart-hardening spectacles; tell these sad women\n"+
		"'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes,\n"+
		"As 'tis to laugh at 'em. My mother, you wot well\n"+
		"My hazards still have been your solace: and\n"+
		"Believe't not lightly--though I go alone,\n"+
		"Like to a lonely dragon, that his fen\n"+
		"Makes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen--your son\n"+
		"Will or exceed the common or be caught\n"+
		"With cautelous baits and practise.\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"My first son.\n"+
		"Whither wilt thou go? Take good Cominius\n"+
		"With thee awhile: determine on some course,\n"+
		"More than a wild exposture to each chance\n"+
		"That starts i' the way before thee.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"O the gods!\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"I'll follow thee a month, devise with thee\n"+
		"Where thou shalt rest, that thou mayst hear of us\n"+
		"And we of thee: so if the time thrust forth\n"+
		"A cause for thy repeal, we shall not send\n"+
		"O'er the vast world to seek a single man,\n"+
		"And lose advantage, which doth ever cool\n"+
		"I' the absence of the needer.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Fare ye well:\n"+
		"Thou hast years upon thee; and thou art too full\n"+
		"Of the wars' surfeits, to go rove with one\n"+
		"That's yet unbruised: bring me but out at gate.\n"+
		"Come, my sweet wife, my dearest mother, and\n"+
		"My friends of noble touch, when I am forth,\n"+
		"Bid me farewell, and smile. I pray you, come.\n"+
		"While I remain above the ground, you shall\n"+
		"Hear from me still, and never of me aught\n"+
		"But what is like me formerly.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"That's worthily\n"+
		"As any ear can hear. Come, let's not weep.\n"+
		"If I could shake off but one seven years\n"+
		"From these old arms and legs, by the good gods,\n"+
		"I'ld with thee every foot.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Give me thy hand: Come.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. The same. A street near the gate.\n"+
		"Enter SICINIUS, BRUTUS, and an AEdile\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Bid them all home; he's gone, and we'll no further.\n"+
		"The nobility are vex'd, whom we see have sided\n"+
		"In his behalf.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"Now we have shown our power,\n"+
		"Let us seem humbler after it is done\n"+
		"Than when it was a-doing.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Bid them home:\n"+
		"Say their great enemy is gone, and they\n"+
		"Stand in their ancient strength.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"Dismiss them home.\n"+
		"Exit AEdile\n"+
		"Here comes his mother.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Let's not meet her.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"Why?\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"They say she's mad.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"They have ta'en note of us: keep on your way.\n"+
		"Enter VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, and MENENIUS\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"O, ye're well met: the hoarded plague o' the gods\n"+
		"Requite your love!\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Peace, peace; be not so loud.\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"If that I could for weeping, you should hear,--\n"+
		"Nay, and you shall hear some.\n"+
		"To BRUTUS\n"+
		"Will you be gone?\n"+
		"VIRGILIA\n"+
		"[To SICINIUS] You shall stay too: I would I had the power\n"+
		"To say so to my husband.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Are you mankind?\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"Ay, fool; is that a shame? Note but this fool.\n"+
		"Was not a man my father? Hadst thou foxship\n"+
		"To banish him that struck more blows for Rome\n"+
		"Than thou hast spoken words?\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"O blessed heavens!\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"More noble blows than ever thou wise words;\n"+
		"And for Rome's good. I'll tell thee what; yet go:\n"+
		"Nay, but thou shalt stay too: I would my son\n"+
		"Were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,\n"+
		"His good sword in his hand.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"What then?\n"+
		"VIRGILIA\n"+
		"What then!\n"+
		"He'ld make an end of thy posterity.\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"Bastards and all.\n"+
		"Good man, the wounds that he does bear for Rome!\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Come, come, peace.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"I would he had continued to his country\n"+
		"As he began, and not unknit himself\n"+
		"The noble knot he made.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"I would he had.\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"'I would he had'! 'Twas you incensed the rabble:\n"+
		"Cats, that can judge as fitly of his worth\n"+
		"As I can of those mysteries which heaven\n"+
		"Will not have earth to know.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"Pray, let us go.\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"Now, pray, sir, get you gone:\n"+
		"You have done a brave deed. Ere you go, hear this:--\n"+
		"As far as doth the Capitol exceed\n"+
		"The meanest house in Rome, so far my son--\n"+
		"This lady's husband here, this, do you see--\n"+
		"Whom you have banish'd, does exceed you all.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"Well, well, we'll leave you.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Why stay we to be baited\n"+
		"With one that wants her wits?\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"Take my prayers with you.\n"+
		"Exeunt Tribunes\n"+
		"I would the gods had nothing else to do\n"+
		"But to confirm my curses! Could I meet 'em\n"+
		"But once a-day, it would unclog my heart\n"+
		"Of what lies heavy to't.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"You have told them home;\n"+
		"And, by my troth, you have cause. You'll sup with me?\n"+

		"SCENE III. A highway between Rome and Antium.\n"+
		"Enter a Roman and a Volsce, meeting\n"+
		"Roman\n"+
		"I know you well, sir, and you know\n"+
		"me: your name, I think, is Adrian.\n"+
		"Volsce\n"+
		"It is so, sir: truly, I have forgot you.\n"+
		"Roman\n"+
		"I am a Roman; and my services are,\n"+
		"as you are, against 'em: know you me yet?\n"+
		"Volsce\n"+
		"Nicanor? no.\n"+
		"Roman\n"+
		"The same, sir.\n"+
		"Volsce\n"+
		"You had more beard when I last saw you; but your\n"+
		"favour is well approved by your tongue. What's the\n"+
		"news in Rome? I have a note from the Volscian state,\n"+
		"to find you out there: you have well saved me a\n"+
		"day's journey.\n"+
		"Roman\n"+
		"There hath been in Rome strange insurrections; the\n"+
		"people against the senators, patricians, and nobles.\n"+
		"Volsce\n"+
		"Hath been! is it ended, then? Our state thinks not\n"+
		"so: they are in a most warlike preparation, and\n"+
		"hope to come upon them in the heat of their division.\n"+
		"Roman\n"+
		"The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing\n"+
		"would make it flame again: for the nobles receive\n"+
		"so to heart the banishment of that worthy\n"+
		"Coriolanus, that they are in a ripe aptness to take\n"+
		"all power from the people and to pluck from them\n"+
		"their tribunes for ever. This lies glowing, I can\n"+
		"tell you, and is almost mature for the violent\n"+
		"breaking out.\n"+
		"Volsce\n"+
		"Coriolanus banished!\n"+
		"Roman\n"+
		"Banished, sir.\n"+
		"Volsce\n"+
		"You will be welcome with this intelligence, Nicanor.\n"+
		"Roman\n"+
		"The day serves well for them now. I have heard it\n"+
		"said, the fittest time to corrupt a man's wife is\n"+
		"when she's fallen out with her husband. Your noble\n"+
		"Tullus Aufidius will appear well in these wars, his\n"+
		"great opposer, Coriolanus, being now in no request\n"+
		"of his country.\n"+
		"Volsce\n"+
		"He cannot choose. I am most fortunate, thus\n"+
		"accidentally to encounter you: you have ended my\n"+
		"business, and I will merrily accompany you home.\n"+
		"Roman\n"+
		"I shall, between this and supper, tell you most\n"+
		"strange things from Rome; all tending to the good of\n"+
		"their adversaries. Have you an army ready, say you?\n"+
		"Volsce\n"+
		"A most royal one; the centurions and their charges,\n"+
		"distinctly billeted, already in the entertainment,\n"+
		"and to be on foot at an hour's warning.\n"+
		"Roman\n"+
		"I am joyful to hear of their readiness, and am the\n"+
		"man, I think, that shall set them in present action.\n"+
		"So, sir, heartily well met, and most glad of your company.\n"+
		"Volsce\n"+
		"You take my part from me, sir; I have the most cause\n"+
		"to be glad of yours.\n"+
		"Roman\n"+
		"Well, let us go together.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV. Antium. Before Aufidius's house.\n"+
		"Enter CORIOLANUS in mean apparel, disguised and muffled\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"A goodly city is this Antium. City,\n"+
		"'Tis I that made thy widows: many an heir\n"+
		"Of these fair edifices 'fore my wars\n"+
		"Have I heard groan and drop: then know me not,\n"+
		"Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones\n"+
		"In puny battle slay me.\n"+
		"Enter a Citizen\n"+
		"Save you, sir.\n"+
		"Citizen\n"+
		"And you.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Direct me, if it be your will,\n"+
		"Where great Aufidius lies: is he in Antium?\n"+
		"Citizen\n"+
		"He is, and feasts the nobles of the state\n"+
		"At his house this night.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Which is his house, beseech you?\n"+
		"Citizen\n"+
		"This, here before you.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Thank you, sir: farewell.\n"+
		"Exit Citizen\n"+
		"O world, thy slippery turns! Friends now fast sworn,\n"+
		"Whose double bosoms seem to wear one heart,\n"+
		"Whose house, whose bed, whose meal, and exercise,\n"+
		"Are still together, who twin, as 'twere, in love\n"+
		"Unseparable, shall within this hour,\n"+
		"On a dissension of a doit, break out\n"+
		"To bitterest enmity: so, fellest foes,\n"+
		"Whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep,\n"+
		"To take the one the other, by some chance,\n"+
		"Some trick not worth an egg, shall grow dear friends\n"+
		"And interjoin their issues. So with me:\n"+
		"My birth-place hate I, and my love's upon\n"+
		"This enemy town. I'll enter: if he slay me,\n"+
		"He does fair justice; if he give me way,\n"+
		"I'll do his country service.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE V. The same. A hall in Aufidius's house.\n"+
		"Music within. Enter a Servingman\n"+
		"First Servingman\n"+
		"Wine, wine, wine! What service\n"+
		"is here! I think our fellows are asleep.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"Enter a second Servingman\n"+
		"Second Servingman\n"+
		"Where's Cotus? my master calls\n"+
		"for him. Cotus!\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"Enter CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"A goodly house: the feast smells well; but I\n"+
		"Appear not like a guest.\n"+
		"Re-enter the first Servingman\n"+
		"First Servingman\n"+
		"What would you have, friend? whence are you?\n"+
		"Here's no place for you: pray, go to the door.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"I have deserved no better entertainment,\n"+
		"In being Coriolanus.\n"+
		"Re-enter second Servingman\n"+
		"Second Servingman\n"+
		"Whence are you, sir? Has the porter his eyes in his\n"+
		"head; that he gives entrance to such companions?\n"+
		"Pray, get you out.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Away!\n"+
		"Second Servingman\n"+
		"Away! get you away.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Now thou'rt troublesome.\n"+
		"Second Servingman\n"+
		"Are you so brave? I'll have you talked with anon.\n"+
		"Enter a third Servingman. The first meets him\n"+
		"Third Servingman\n"+
		"What fellow's this?\n"+
		"First Servingman\n"+
		"A strange one as ever I looked on: I cannot get him\n"+
		"out of the house: prithee, call my master to him.\n"+
		"Retires\n"+
		"Third Servingman\n"+
		"What have you to do here, fellow? Pray you, avoid\n"+
		"the house.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Let me but stand; I will not hurt your hearth.\n"+
		"Third Servingman\n"+
		"What are you?\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"A gentleman.\n"+
		"Third Servingman\n"+
		"A marvellous poor one.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"True, so I am.\n"+
		"Third Servingman\n"+
		"Pray you, poor gentleman, take up some other\n"+
		"station; here's no place for you; pray you, avoid: come.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Follow your function, go, and batten on cold bits.\n"+
		"Pushes him away\n"+
		"Third Servingman\n"+
		"What, you will not? Prithee, tell my master what a\n"+
		"strange guest he has here.\n"+
		"Second Servingman\n"+
		"And I shall.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"Third Servingman\n"+
		"Where dwellest thou?\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Under the canopy.\n"+
		"Third Servingman\n"+
		"Under the canopy!\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Ay.\n"+
		"Third Servingman\n"+
		"Where's that?\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"I' the city of kites and crows.\n"+
		"Third Servingman\n"+
		"I' the city of kites and crows! What an ass it is!\n"+
		"Then thou dwellest with daws too?\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"No, I serve not thy master.\n"+
		"Third Servingman\n"+
		"How, sir! do you meddle with my master?\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Ay; 'tis an honester service than to meddle with thy\n"+
		"mistress. Thou pratest, and pratest; serve with thy\n"+
		"trencher, hence!\n"+
		"Beats him away. Exit third Servingman\n"+
		"Enter AUFIDIUS with the second Servingman\n"+
		"AUFIDIUS\n"+
		"Where is this fellow?\n"+
		"Second Servingman\n"+
		"Here, sir: I'ld have beaten him like a dog, but for\n"+
		"disturbing the lords within.\n"+
		"Retires\n"+
		"AUFIDIUS\n"+
		"Whence comest thou? what wouldst thou? thy name?\n"+
		"Why speak'st not? speak, man: what's thy name?\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"If, Tullus,\n"+
		"Unmuffling\n"+
		"Not yet thou knowest me, and, seeing me, dost not\n"+
		"Think me for the man I am, necessity\n"+
		"Commands me name myself.\n"+
		"AUFIDIUS\n"+
		"What is thy name?\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears,\n"+
		"And harsh in sound to thine.\n"+
		"AUFIDIUS\n"+
		"Say, what's thy name?\n"+
		"Thou hast a grim appearance, and thy face\n"+
		"Bears a command in't; though thy tackle's torn.\n"+
		"Thou show'st a noble vessel: what's thy name?\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Prepare thy brow to frown: know'st\n"+
		"thou me yet?\n"+
		"AUFIDIUS\n"+
		"I know thee not: thy name?\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"My name is Caius Marcius, who hath done\n"+
		"To thee particularly and to all the Volsces\n"+
		"Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may\n"+
		"My surname, Coriolanus: the painful service,\n"+
		"The extreme dangers and the drops of blood\n"+
		"Shed for my thankless country are requited\n"+
		"But with that surname; a good memory,\n"+
		"And witness of the malice and displeasure\n"+
		"Which thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains;\n"+
		"The cruelty and envy of the people,\n"+
		"Permitted by our dastard nobles, who\n"+
		"Have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest;\n"+
		"And suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be\n"+
		"Whoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremity\n"+
		"Hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope--\n"+
		"Mistake me not--to save my life, for if\n"+
		"I had fear'd death, of all the men i' the world\n"+
		"I would have 'voided thee, but in mere spite,\n"+
		"To be full quit of those my banishers,\n"+
		"Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast\n"+
		"A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge\n"+
		"Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims\n"+
		"Of shame seen through thy country, speed\n"+
		"thee straight,\n"+
		"And make my misery serve thy turn: so use it\n"+
		"That my revengeful services may prove\n"+
		"As benefits to thee, for I will fight\n"+
		"Against my canker'd country with the spleen\n"+
		"Of all the under fiends. But if so be\n"+
		"Thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes\n"+
		"Thou'rt tired, then, in a word, I also am\n"+
		"Longer to live most weary, and present\n"+
		"My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;\n"+
		"Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,\n"+
		"Since I have ever follow'd thee with hate,\n"+
		"Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,\n"+
		"And cannot live but to thy shame, unless\n"+
		"It be to do thee service.\n"+
		"AUFIDIUS\n"+
		"O Marcius, Marcius!\n"+
		"Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart\n"+
		"A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter\n"+
		"Should from yond cloud speak divine things,\n"+
		"And say 'Tis true,' I'ld not believe them more\n"+
		"Than thee, all noble Marcius. Let me twine\n"+
		"Mine arms about that body, where against\n"+
		"My grained ash an hundred times hath broke\n"+
		"And scarr'd the moon with splinters: here I clip\n"+
		"The anvil of my sword, and do contest\n"+
		"As hotly and as nobly with thy love\n"+
		"As ever in ambitious strength I did\n"+
		"Contend against thy valour. Know thou first,\n"+
		"I loved the maid I married; never man\n"+
		"Sigh'd truer breath; but that I see thee here,\n"+
		"Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart\n"+
		"Than when I first my wedded mistress saw\n"+
		"Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee,\n"+
		"We have a power on foot; and I had purpose\n"+
		"Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,\n"+
		"Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out\n"+
		"Twelve several times, and I have nightly since\n"+
		"Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me;\n"+
		"We have been down together in my sleep,\n"+
		"Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat,\n"+
		"And waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,\n"+
		"Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that\n"+
		"Thou art thence banish'd, we would muster all\n"+
		"From twelve to seventy, and pouring war\n"+
		"Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,\n"+
		"Like a bold flood o'er-bear. O, come, go in,\n"+
		"And take our friendly senators by the hands;\n"+
		"Who now are here, taking their leaves of me,\n"+
		"Who am prepared against your territories,\n"+
		"Though not for Rome itself.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"You bless me, gods!\n"+
		"AUFIDIUS\n"+
		"Therefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt have\n"+
		"The leading of thine own revenges, take\n"+
		"The one half of my commission; and set down--\n"+
		"As best thou art experienced, since thou know'st\n"+
		"Thy country's strength and weakness,--thine own ways;\n"+
		"Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,\n"+
		"Or rudely visit them in parts remote,\n"+
		"To fright them, ere destroy. But come in:\n"+
		"Let me commend thee first to those that shall\n"+
		"Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!\n"+
		"And more a friend than e'er an enemy;\n"+
		"Yet, Marcius, that was much. Your hand: most welcome!\n"+
		"Exeunt CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS. The two Servingmen come forward\n"+
		"First Servingman\n"+
		"Here's a strange alteration!\n"+
		"Second Servingman\n"+
		"By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him with\n"+
		"a cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a\n"+
		"false report of him.\n"+
		"First Servingman\n"+
		"What an arm he has! he turned me about with his\n"+
		"finger and his thumb, as one would set up a top.\n"+
		"Second Servingman\n"+
		"Nay, I knew by his face that there was something in\n"+
		"him: he had, sir, a kind of face, methought,--I\n"+
		"cannot tell how to term it.\n"+
		"First Servingman\n"+
		"He had so; looking as it were--would I were hanged,\n"+
		"but I thought there was more in him than I could think.\n"+
		"Second Servingman\n"+
		"So did I, I'll be sworn: he is simply the rarest\n"+
		"man i' the world.\n"+
		"First Servingman\n"+
		"I think he is: but a greater soldier than he you wot on.\n"+
		"Second Servingman\n"+
		"Who, my master?\n"+
		"First Servingman\n"+
		"Nay, it's no matter for that.\n"+
		"Second Servingman\n"+
		"Worth six on him.\n"+
		"First Servingman\n"+
		"Nay, not so neither: but I take him to be the\n"+
		"greater soldier.\n"+
		"Second Servingman\n"+
		"Faith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that:\n"+
		"for the defence of a town, our general is excellent.\n"+
		"First Servingman\n"+
		"Ay, and for an assault too.\n"+
		"Re-enter third Servingman\n"+
		"Third Servingman\n"+
		"O slaves, I can tell you news,-- news, you rascals!\n"+
		"First Servingman\n"+
		"Second Servingman\n"+
		"What, what, what? let's partake.\n"+
		"Third Servingman\n"+
		"I would not be a Roman, of all nations; I had as\n"+
		"lieve be a condemned man.\n"+
		"First Servingman\n"+
		"Second Servingman\n"+
		"Wherefore? wherefore?\n"+
		"Third Servingman\n"+
		"Why, here's he that was wont to thwack our general,\n"+
		"Caius Marcius.\n"+
		"First Servingman\n"+
		"Why do you say 'thwack our general '?\n"+
		"Third Servingman\n"+
		"I do not say 'thwack our general;' but he was always\n"+
		"good enough for him.\n"+
		"Second Servingman\n"+
		"Come, we are fellows and friends: he was ever too\n"+
		"hard for him; I have heard him say so himself.\n"+
		"First Servingman\n"+
		"He was too hard for him directly, to say the troth\n"+
		"on't: before Corioli he scotched him and notched\n"+
		"him like a carbon ado.\n"+
		"Second Servingman\n"+
		"An he had been cannibally given, he might have\n"+
		"broiled and eaten him too.\n"+
		"First Servingman\n"+
		"But, more of thy news?\n"+
		"Third Servingman\n"+
		"Why, he is so made on here within, as if he were son\n"+
		"and heir to Mars; set at upper end o' the table; no\n"+
		"question asked him by any of the senators, but they\n"+
		"stand bald before him: our general himself makes a\n"+
		"mistress of him: sanctifies himself with's hand and\n"+
		"turns up the white o' the eye to his discourse. But\n"+
		"the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i'\n"+
		"the middle and but one half of what he was\n"+
		"yesterday; for the other has half, by the entreaty\n"+
		"and grant of the whole table. He'll go, he says,\n"+
		"and sowl the porter of Rome gates by the ears: he\n"+
		"will mow all down before him, and leave his passage polled.\n"+
		"Second Servingman\n"+
		"And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine.\n"+
		"Third Servingman\n"+
		"Do't! he will do't; for, look you, sir, he has as\n"+
		"many friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as it\n"+
		"were, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, as\n"+
		"we term it, his friends whilst he's in directitude.\n"+
		"First Servingman\n"+
		"Directitude! what's that?\n"+
		"Third Servingman\n"+
		"But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again,\n"+
		"and the man in blood, they will out of their\n"+
		"burrows, like conies after rain, and revel all with\n"+
		"him.\n"+
		"First Servingman\n"+
		"But when goes this forward?\n"+
		"Third Servingman\n"+
		"To-morrow; to-day; presently; you shall have the\n"+
		"drum struck up this afternoon: 'tis, as it were, a\n"+
		"parcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they\n"+
		"wipe their lips.\n"+
		"Second Servingman\n"+
		"Why, then we shall have a stirring world again.\n"+
		"This peace is nothing, but to rust iron, increase\n"+
		"tailors, and breed ballad-makers.\n"+
		"First Servingman\n"+
		"Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far as\n"+
		"day does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, and\n"+
		"full of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy;\n"+
		"mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of more\n"+
		"bastard children than war's a destroyer of men.\n"+
		"Second Servingman\n"+
		"'Tis so: and as war, in some sort, may be said to\n"+
		"be a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a\n"+
		"great maker of cuckolds.\n"+
		"First Servingman\n"+
		"Ay, and it makes men hate one another.\n"+
		"Third Servingman\n"+
		"Reason; because they then less need one another.\n"+
		"The wars for my money. I hope to see Romans as cheap\n"+
		"as Volscians. They are rising, they are rising.\n"+
		"All\n"+
		"In, in, in, in!\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE VI. Rome. A public place.\n"+
		"Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"We hear not of him, neither need we fear him;\n"+
		"His remedies are tame i' the present peace\n"+
		"And quietness of the people, which before\n"+
		"Were in wild hurry. Here do we make his friends\n"+
		"Blush that the world goes well, who rather had,\n"+
		"Though they themselves did suffer by't, behold\n"+
		"Dissentious numbers pestering streets than see\n"+
		"Our tradesmen with in their shops and going\n"+
		"About their functions friendly.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"We stood to't in good time.\n"+
		"Enter MENENIUS\n"+
		"Is this Menenius?\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"'Tis he,'tis he: O, he is grown most kind of late.\n"+
		"Both Tribunes\n"+
		"Hail sir!\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Hail to you both!\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Your Coriolanus\n"+
		"Is not much miss'd, but with his friends:\n"+
		"The commonwealth doth stand, and so would do,\n"+
		"Were he more angry at it.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"All's well; and might have been much better, if\n"+
		"He could have temporized.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Where is he, hear you?\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Nay, I hear nothing: his mother and his wife\n"+
		"Hear nothing from him.\n"+
		"Enter three or four Citizens\n"+
		"Citizens\n"+
		"The gods preserve you both!\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"God-den, our neighbours.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"God-den to you all, god-den to you all.\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"Ourselves, our wives, and children, on our knees,\n"+
		"Are bound to pray for you both.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Live, and thrive!\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"Farewell, kind neighbours: we wish'd Coriolanus\n"+
		"Had loved you as we did.\n"+
		"Citizens\n"+
		"Now the gods keep you!\n"+
		"Both Tribunes\n"+
		"Farewell, farewell.\n"+
		"Exeunt Citizens\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"This is a happier and more comely time\n"+
		"Than when these fellows ran about the streets,\n"+
		"Crying confusion.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"Caius Marcius was\n"+
		"A worthy officer i' the war; but insolent,\n"+
		"O'ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking,\n"+
		"Self-loving,--\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"And affecting one sole throne,\n"+
		"Without assistance.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"I think not so.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"We should by this, to all our lamentation,\n"+
		"If he had gone forth consul, found it so.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"The gods have well prevented it, and Rome\n"+
		"Sits safe and still without him.\n"+
		"Enter an AEdile\n"+
		"AEdile\n"+
		"Worthy tribunes,\n"+
		"There is a slave, whom we have put in prison,\n"+
		"Reports, the Volsces with two several powers\n"+
		"Are enter'd in the Roman territories,\n"+
		"And with the deepest malice of the war\n"+
		"Destroy what lies before 'em.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"'Tis Aufidius,\n"+
		"Who, hearing of our Marcius' banishment,\n"+
		"Thrusts forth his horns again into the world;\n"+
		"Which were inshell'd when Marcius stood for Rome,\n"+
		"And durst not once peep out.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Come, what talk you\n"+
		"Of Marcius?\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"Go see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot be\n"+
		"The Volsces dare break with us.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Cannot be!\n"+
		"We have record that very well it can,\n"+
		"And three examples of the like have been\n"+
		"Within my age. But reason with the fellow,\n"+
		"Before you punish him, where he heard this,\n"+
		"Lest you shall chance to whip your information\n"+
		"And beat the messenger who bids beware\n"+
		"Of what is to be dreaded.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Tell not me:\n"+
		"I know this cannot be.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"Not possible.\n"+
		"Enter a Messenger\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"The nobles in great earnestness are going\n"+
		"All to the senate-house: some news is come\n"+
		"That turns their countenances.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"'Tis this slave;--\n"+
		"Go whip him, 'fore the people's eyes:--his raising;\n"+
		"Nothing but his report.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Yes, worthy sir,\n"+
		"The slave's report is seconded; and more,\n"+
		"More fearful, is deliver'd.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"What more fearful?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"It is spoke freely out of many mouths--\n"+
		"How probable I do not know--that Marcius,\n"+
		"Join'd with Aufidius, leads a power 'gainst Rome,\n"+
		"And vows revenge as spacious as between\n"+
		"The young'st and oldest thing.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"This is most likely!\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"Raised only, that the weaker sort may wish\n"+
		"Good Marcius home again.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"The very trick on't.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"This is unlikely:\n"+
		"He and Aufidius can no more atone\n"+
		"Than violentest contrariety.\n"+
		"Enter a second Messenger\n"+
		"Second Messenger\n"+
		"You are sent for to the senate:\n"+
		"A fearful army, led by Caius Marcius\n"+
		"Associated with Aufidius, rages\n"+
		"Upon our territories; and have already\n"+
		"O'erborne their way, consumed with fire, and took\n"+
		"What lay before them.\n"+
		"Enter COMINIUS\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"O, you have made good work!\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"What news? what news?\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"You have holp to ravish your own daughters and\n"+
		"To melt the city leads upon your pates,\n"+
		"To see your wives dishonour'd to your noses,--\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"What's the news? what's the news?\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"Your temples burned in their cement, and\n"+
		"Your franchises, whereon you stood, confined\n"+
		"Into an auger's bore.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Pray now, your news?\n"+
		"You have made fair work, I fear me.--Pray, your news?--\n"+
		"If Marcius should be join'd with Volscians,--\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"If!\n"+
		"He is their god: he leads them like a thing\n"+
		"Made by some other deity than nature,\n"+
		"That shapes man better; and they follow him,\n"+
		"Against us brats, with no less confidence\n"+
		"Than boys pursuing summer butterflies,\n"+
		"Or butchers killing flies.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"You have made good work,\n"+
		"You and your apron-men; you that stood so up much\n"+
		"on the voice of occupation and\n"+
		"The breath of garlic-eaters!\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"He will shake\n"+
		"Your Rome about your ears.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"As Hercules\n"+
		"Did shake down mellow fruit.\n"+
		"You have made fair work!\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"But is this true, sir?\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"Ay; and you'll look pale\n"+
		"Before you find it other. All the regions\n"+
		"Do smilingly revolt; and who resist\n"+
		"Are mock'd for valiant ignorance,\n"+
		"And perish constant fools. Who is't can blame him?\n"+
		"Your enemies and his find something in him.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"We are all undone, unless\n"+
		"The noble man have mercy.\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"Who shall ask it?\n"+
		"The tribunes cannot do't for shame; the people\n"+
		"Deserve such pity of him as the wolf\n"+
		"Does of the shepherds: for his best friends, if they\n"+
		"Should say 'Be good to Rome,' they charged him even\n"+
		"As those should do that had deserved his hate,\n"+
		"And therein show'd like enemies.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"'Tis true:\n"+
		"If he were putting to my house the brand\n"+
		"That should consume it, I have not the face\n"+
		"To say 'Beseech you, cease.' You have made fair hands,\n"+
		"You and your crafts! you have crafted fair!\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"You have brought\n"+
		"A trembling upon Rome, such as was never\n"+
		"So incapable of help.\n"+
		"Both Tribunes\n"+
		"Say not we brought it.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"How! Was it we? we loved him but, like beasts\n"+
		"And cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters,\n"+
		"Who did hoot him out o' the city.\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"But I fear\n"+
		"They'll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius,\n"+
		"The second name of men, obeys his points\n"+
		"As if he were his officer: desperation\n"+
		"Is all the policy, strength and defence,\n"+
		"That Rome can make against them.\n"+
		"Enter a troop of Citizens\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Here come the clusters.\n"+
		"And is Aufidius with him? You are they\n"+
		"That made the air unwholesome, when you cast\n"+
		"Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at\n"+
		"Coriolanus' exile. Now he's coming;\n"+
		"And not a hair upon a soldier's head\n"+
		"Which will not prove a whip: as many coxcombs\n"+
		"As you threw caps up will he tumble down,\n"+
		"And pay you for your voices. 'Tis no matter;\n"+
		"if he could burn us all into one coal,\n"+
		"We have deserved it.\n"+
		"Citizens\n"+
		"Faith, we hear fearful news.\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"For mine own part,\n"+
		"When I said, banish him, I said 'twas pity.\n"+
		"Second Citizen\n"+
		"And so did I.\n"+
		"Third Citizen\n"+
		"And so did I; and, to say the truth, so did very\n"+
		"many of us: that we did, we did for the best; and\n"+
		"though we willingly consented to his banishment, yet\n"+
		"it was against our will.\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"Ye re goodly things, you voices!\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"You have made\n"+
		"Good work, you and your cry! Shall's to the Capitol?\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"O, ay, what else?\n"+
		"Exeunt COMINIUS and MENENIUS\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Go, masters, get you home; be not dismay'd:\n"+
		"These are a side that would be glad to have\n"+
		"This true which they so seem to fear. Go home,\n"+
		"And show no sign of fear.\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"The gods be good to us! Come, masters, let's home.\n"+
		"I ever said we were i' the wrong when we banished\n"+
		"him.\n"+
		"Second Citizen\n"+
		"So did we all. But, come, let's home.\n"+
		"Exeunt Citizens\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"I do not like this news.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Nor I.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"Let's to the Capitol. Would half my wealth\n"+
		"Would buy this for a lie!\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Pray, let us go.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE VII. A camp, at a small distance from Rome.\n"+
		"Enter AUFIDIUS and his Lieutenant\n"+
		"AUFIDIUS\n"+
		"Do they still fly to the Roman?\n"+
		"Lieutenant\n"+
		"I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but\n"+
		"Your soldiers use him as the grace 'fore meat,\n"+
		"Their talk at table, and their thanks at end;\n"+
		"And you are darken'd in this action, sir,\n"+
		"Even by your own.\n"+
		"AUFIDIUS\n"+
		"I cannot help it now,\n"+
		"Unless, by using means, I lame the foot\n"+
		"Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier,\n"+
		"Even to my person, than I thought he would\n"+
		"When first I did embrace him: yet his nature\n"+
		"In that's no changeling; and I must excuse\n"+
		"What cannot be amended.\n"+
		"Lieutenant\n"+
		"Yet I wish, sir,--\n"+
		"I mean for your particular,--you had not\n"+
		"Join'd in commission with him; but either\n"+
		"Had borne the action of yourself, or else\n"+
		"To him had left it solely.\n"+
		"AUFIDIUS\n"+
		"I understand thee well; and be thou sure,\n"+
		"when he shall come to his account, he knows not\n"+
		"What I can urge against him. Although it seems,\n"+
		"And so he thinks, and is no less apparent\n"+
		"To the vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly.\n"+
		"And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,\n"+
		"Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon\n"+
		"As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone\n"+
		"That which shall break his neck or hazard mine,\n"+
		"Whene'er we come to our account.\n"+
		"Lieutenant\n"+
		"Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?\n"+
		"AUFIDIUS\n"+
		"All places yield to him ere he sits down;\n"+
		"And the nobility of Rome are his:\n"+
		"The senators and patricians love him too:\n"+
		"The tribunes are no soldiers; and their people\n"+
		"Will be as rash in the repeal, as hasty\n"+
		"To expel him thence. I think he'll be to Rome\n"+
		"As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it\n"+
		"By sovereignty of nature. First he was\n"+
		"A noble servant to them; but he could not\n"+
		"Carry his honours even: whether 'twas pride,\n"+
		"Which out of daily fortune ever taints\n"+
		"The happy man; whether defect of judgment,\n"+
		"To fail in the disposing of those chances\n"+
		"Which he was lord of; or whether nature,\n"+
		"Not to be other than one thing, not moving\n"+
		"From the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace\n"+
		"Even with the same austerity and garb\n"+
		"As he controll'd the war; but one of these--\n"+
		"As he hath spices of them all, not all,\n"+
		"For I dare so far free him--made him fear'd,\n"+
		"So hated, and so banish'd: but he has a merit,\n"+
		"To choke it in the utterance. So our virtues\n"+
		"Lie in the interpretation of the time:\n"+
		"And power, unto itself most commendable,\n"+
		"Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair\n"+
		"To extol what it hath done.\n"+
		"One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;\n"+
		"Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.\n"+
		"Come, let's away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,\n"+
		"Thou art poor'st of all; then shortly art thou mine.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT V\n"+
		"SCENE I. Rome. A public place.\n"+
		"Enter MENENIUS, COMINIUS, SICINIUS, BRUTUS, and others\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"No, I'll not go: you hear what he hath said\n"+
		"Which was sometime his general; who loved him\n"+
		"In a most dear particular. He call'd me father:\n"+
		"But what o' that? Go, you that banish'd him;\n"+
		"A mile before his tent fall down, and knee\n"+
		"The way into his mercy: nay, if he coy'd\n"+
		"To hear Cominius speak, I'll keep at home.\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"He would not seem to know me.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Do you hear?\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"Yet one time he did call me by my name:\n"+
		"I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops\n"+
		"That we have bled together. Coriolanus\n"+
		"He would not answer to: forbad all names;\n"+
		"He was a kind of nothing, titleless,\n"+
		"Till he had forged himself a name o' the fire\n"+
		"Of burning Rome.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Why, so: you have made good work!\n"+
		"A pair of tribunes that have rack'd for Rome,\n"+
		"To make coals cheap,--a noble memory!\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"I minded him how royal 'twas to pardon\n"+
		"When it was less expected: he replied,\n"+
		"It was a bare petition of a state\n"+
		"To one whom they had punish'd.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Very well:\n"+
		"Could he say less?\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"I offer'd to awaken his regard\n"+
		"For's private friends: his answer to me was,\n"+
		"He could not stay to pick them in a pile\n"+
		"Of noisome musty chaff: he said 'twas folly,\n"+
		"For one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt,\n"+
		"And still to nose the offence.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"For one poor grain or two!\n"+
		"I am one of those; his mother, wife, his child,\n"+
		"And this brave fellow too, we are the grains:\n"+
		"You are the musty chaff; and you are smelt\n"+
		"Above the moon: we must be burnt for you.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Nay, pray, be patient: if you refuse your aid\n"+
		"In this so never-needed help, yet do not\n"+
		"Upbraid's with our distress. But, sure, if you\n"+
		"Would be your country's pleader, your good tongue,\n"+
		"More than the instant army we can make,\n"+
		"Might stop our countryman.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"No, I'll not meddle.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Pray you, go to him.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"What should I do?\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"Only make trial what your love can do\n"+
		"For Rome, towards Marcius.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Well, and say that Marcius\n"+
		"Return me, as Cominius is return'd,\n"+
		"Unheard; what then?\n"+
		"But as a discontented friend, grief-shot\n"+
		"With his unkindness? say't be so?\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Yet your good will\n"+
		"must have that thanks from Rome, after the measure\n"+
		"As you intended well.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"I'll undertake 't:\n"+
		"I think he'll hear me. Yet, to bite his lip\n"+
		"And hum at good Cominius, much unhearts me.\n"+
		"He was not taken well; he had not dined:\n"+
		"The veins unfill'd, our blood is cold, and then\n"+
		"We pout upon the morning, are unapt\n"+
		"To give or to forgive; but when we have stuff'd\n"+
		"These and these conveyances of our blood\n"+
		"With wine and feeding, we have suppler souls\n"+
		"Than in our priest-like fasts: therefore I'll watch him\n"+
		"Till he be dieted to my request,\n"+
		"And then I'll set upon him.\n"+
		"BRUTUS\n"+
		"You know the very road into his kindness,\n"+
		"And cannot lose your way.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Good faith, I'll prove him,\n"+
		"Speed how it will. I shall ere long have knowledge\n"+
		"Of my success.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"He'll never hear him.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Not?\n"+
		"COMINIUS\n"+
		"I tell you, he does sit in gold, his eye\n"+
		"Red as 'twould burn Rome; and his injury\n"+
		"The gaoler to his pity. I kneel'd before him;\n"+
		"'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise;' dismiss'd me\n"+
		"Thus, with his speechless hand: what he would do,\n"+
		"He sent in writing after me; what he would not,\n"+
		"Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions:\n"+
		"So that all hope is vain.\n"+
		"Unless his noble mother, and his wife;\n"+
		"Who, as I hear, mean to solicit him\n"+
		"For mercy to his country. Therefore, let's hence,\n"+
		"And with our fair entreaties haste them on.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. Entrance of the Volscian camp before Rome.\n"+
		"Two Sentinels on guard.\n"+
		"Enter to them, MENENIUS\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"Stay: whence are you?\n"+
		"Second Senator\n"+
		"Stand, and go back.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"You guard like men; 'tis well: but, by your leave,\n"+
		"I am an officer of state, and come\n"+
		"To speak with Coriolanus.\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"From whence?\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"From Rome.\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"You may not pass, you must return: our general\n"+
		"Will no more hear from thence.\n"+
		"Second Senator\n"+
		"You'll see your Rome embraced with fire before\n"+
		"You'll speak with Coriolanus.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Good my friends,\n"+
		"If you have heard your general talk of Rome,\n"+
		"And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks,\n"+
		"My name hath touch'd your ears it is Menenius.\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"Be it so; go back: the virtue of your name\n"+
		"Is not here passable.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"I tell thee, fellow,\n"+
		"The general is my lover: I have been\n"+
		"The book of his good acts, whence men have read\n"+
		"His name unparallel'd, haply amplified;\n"+
		"For I have ever verified my friends,\n"+
		"Of whom he's chief, with all the size that verity\n"+
		"Would without lapsing suffer: nay, sometimes,\n"+
		"Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,\n"+
		"I have tumbled past the throw; and in his praise\n"+
		"Have almost stamp'd the leasing: therefore, fellow,\n"+
		"I must have leave to pass.\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his\n"+
		"behalf as you have uttered words in your own, you\n"+
		"should not pass here; no, though it were as virtuous\n"+
		"to lie as to live chastely. Therefore, go back.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Prithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius,\n"+
		"always factionary on the party of your general.\n"+
		"Second Senator\n"+
		"Howsoever you have been his liar, as you say you\n"+
		"have, I am one that, telling true under him, must\n"+
		"say, you cannot pass. Therefore, go back.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Has he dined, canst thou tell? for I would not\n"+
		"speak with him till after dinner.\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"You are a Roman, are you?\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"I am, as thy general is.\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"Then you should hate Rome, as he does. Can you,\n"+
		"when you have pushed out your gates the very\n"+
		"defender of them, and, in a violent popular\n"+
		"ignorance, given your enemy your shield, think to\n"+
		"front his revenges with the easy groans of old\n"+
		"women, the virginal palms of your daughters, or with\n"+
		"the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as\n"+
		"you seem to be? Can you think to blow out the\n"+
		"intended fire your city is ready to flame in, with\n"+
		"such weak breath as this? No, you are deceived;\n"+
		"therefore, back to Rome, and prepare for your\n"+
		"execution: you are condemned, our general has sworn\n"+
		"you out of reprieve and pardon.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Sirrah, if thy captain knew I were here, he would\n"+
		"use me with estimation.\n"+
		"Second Senator\n"+
		"Come, my captain knows you not.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"I mean, thy general.\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"My general cares not for you. Back, I say, go; lest\n"+
		"I let forth your half-pint of blood; back,--that's\n"+
		"the utmost of your having: back.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Nay, but, fellow, fellow,--\n"+
		"Enter CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"What's the matter?\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"Now, you companion, I'll say an errand for you:\n"+
		"You shall know now that I am in estimation; you shall\n"+
		"perceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me from\n"+
		"my son Coriolanus: guess, but by my entertainment\n"+
		"with him, if thou standest not i' the state of\n"+
		"hanging, or of some death more long in\n"+
		"spectatorship, and crueller in suffering; behold now\n"+
		"presently, and swoon for what's to come upon thee.\n"+
		"To CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy\n"+
		"particular prosperity, and love thee no worse than\n"+
		"thy old father Menenius does! O my son, my son!\n"+
		"thou art preparing fire for us; look thee, here's\n"+
		"water to quench it. I was hardly moved to come to\n"+
		"thee; but being assured none but myself could move\n"+
		"thee, I have been blown out of your gates with\n"+
		"sighs; and conjure thee to pardon Rome, and thy\n"+
		"petitionary countrymen. The good gods assuage thy\n"+
		"wrath, and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet\n"+
		"here,--this, who, like a block, hath denied my\n"+
		"access to thee.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Away!\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"How! away!\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Wife, mother, child, I know not. My affairs\n"+
		"Are servanted to others: though I owe\n"+
		"My revenge properly, my remission lies\n"+
		"In Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar,\n"+
		"Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison, rather\n"+
		"Than pity note how much. Therefore, be gone.\n"+
		"Mine ears against your suits are stronger than\n"+
		"Your gates against my force. Yet, for I loved thee,\n"+
		"Take this along; I writ it for thy sake\n"+
		"Gives a letter\n"+
		"And would have rent it. Another word, Menenius,\n"+
		"I will not hear thee speak. This man, Aufidius,\n"+
		"Was my beloved in Rome: yet thou behold'st!\n"+
		"AUFIDIUS\n"+
		"You keep a constant temper.\n"+
		"Exeunt CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"Now, sir, is your name Menenius?\n"+
		"Second Senator\n"+
		"'Tis a spell, you see, of much power: you know the\n"+
		"way home again.\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"Do you hear how we are shent for keeping your\n"+
		"greatness back?\n"+
		"Second Senator\n"+
		"What cause, do you think, I have to swoon?\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"I neither care for the world nor your general: for\n"+
		"such things as you, I can scarce think there's any,\n"+
		"ye're so slight. He that hath a will to die by\n"+
		"himself fears it not from another: let your general\n"+
		"do his worst. For you, be that you are, long; and\n"+
		"your misery increase with your age! I say to you,\n"+
		"as I was said to, Away!\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"A noble fellow, I warrant him.\n"+
		"Second Senator\n"+
		"The worthy fellow is our general: he's the rock, the\n"+
		"oak not to be wind-shaken.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. The tent of Coriolanus.\n"+
		"Enter CORIOLANUS, AUFIDIUS, and others\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"We will before the walls of Rome tomorrow\n"+
		"Set down our host. My partner in this action,\n"+
		"You must report to the Volscian lords, how plainly\n"+
		"I have borne this business.\n"+
		"AUFIDIUS\n"+
		"Only their ends\n"+
		"You have respected; stopp'd your ears against\n"+
		"The general suit of Rome; never admitted\n"+
		"A private whisper, no, not with such friends\n"+
		"That thought them sure of you.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"This last old man,\n"+
		"Whom with a crack'd heart I have sent to Rome,\n"+
		"Loved me above the measure of a father;\n"+
		"Nay, godded me, indeed. Their latest refuge\n"+
		"Was to send him; for whose old love I have,\n"+
		"Though I show'd sourly to him, once more offer'd\n"+
		"The first conditions, which they did refuse\n"+
		"And cannot now accept; to grace him only\n"+
		"That thought he could do more, a very little\n"+
		"I have yielded to: fresh embassies and suits,\n"+
		"Nor from the state nor private friends, hereafter\n"+
		"Will I lend ear to. Ha! what shout is this?\n"+
		"Shout within\n"+
		"Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow\n"+
		"In the same time 'tis made? I will not.\n"+
		"Enter in mourning habits, VIRGILIA, VOLUMNIA, leading young MARCIUS, VALERIA, and Attendants\n"+
		"My wife comes foremost; then the honour'd mould\n"+
		"Wherein this trunk was framed, and in her hand\n"+
		"The grandchild to her blood. But, out, affection!\n"+
		"All bond and privilege of nature, break!\n"+
		"Let it be virtuous to be obstinate.\n"+
		"What is that curt'sy worth? or those doves' eyes,\n"+
		"Which can make gods forsworn? I melt, and am not\n"+
		"Of stronger earth than others. My mother bows;\n"+
		"As if Olympus to a molehill should\n"+
		"In supplication nod: and my young boy\n"+
		"Hath an aspect of intercession, which\n"+
		"Great nature cries 'Deny not.' let the Volsces\n"+
		"Plough Rome and harrow Italy: I'll never\n"+
		"Be such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand,\n"+
		"As if a man were author of himself\n"+
		"And knew no other kin.\n"+
		"VIRGILIA\n"+
		"My lord and husband!\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.\n"+
		"VIRGILIA\n"+
		"The sorrow that delivers us thus changed\n"+
		"Makes you think so.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Like a dull actor now,\n"+
		"I have forgot my part, and I am out,\n"+
		"Even to a full disgrace. Best of my flesh,\n"+
		"Forgive my tyranny; but do not say\n"+
		"For that 'Forgive our Romans.' O, a kiss\n"+
		"Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge!\n"+
		"Now, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kiss\n"+
		"I carried from thee, dear; and my true lip\n"+
		"Hath virgin'd it e'er since. You gods! I prate,\n"+
		"And the most noble mother of the world\n"+
		"Leave unsaluted: sink, my knee, i' the earth;\n"+
		"Kneels\n"+
		"Of thy deep duty more impression show\n"+
		"Than that of common sons.\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"O, stand up blest!\n"+
		"Whilst, with no softer cushion than the flint,\n"+
		"I kneel before thee; and unproperly\n"+
		"Show duty, as mistaken all this while\n"+
		"Between the child and parent.\n"+
		"Kneels\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"What is this?\n"+
		"Your knees to me? to your corrected son?\n"+
		"Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach\n"+
		"Fillip the stars; then let the mutinous winds\n"+
		"Strike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun;\n"+
		"Murdering impossibility, to make\n"+
		"What cannot be, slight work.\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"Thou art my warrior;\n"+
		"I holp to frame thee. Do you know this lady?\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"The noble sister of Publicola,\n"+
		"The moon of Rome, chaste as the icicle\n"+
		"That's curdied by the frost from purest snow\n"+
		"And hangs on Dian's temple: dear Valeria!\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"This is a poor epitome of yours,\n"+
		"Which by the interpretation of full time\n"+
		"May show like all yourself.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"The god of soldiers,\n"+
		"With the consent of supreme Jove, inform\n"+
		"Thy thoughts with nobleness; that thou mayst prove\n"+
		"To shame unvulnerable, and stick i' the wars\n"+
		"Like a great sea-mark, standing every flaw,\n"+
		"And saving those that eye thee!\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"Your knee, sirrah.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"That's my brave boy!\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"Even he, your wife, this lady, and myself,\n"+
		"Are suitors to you.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"I beseech you, peace:\n"+
		"Or, if you'ld ask, remember this before:\n"+
		"The thing I have forsworn to grant may never\n"+
		"Be held by you denials. Do not bid me\n"+
		"Dismiss my soldiers, or capitulate\n"+
		"Again with Rome's mechanics: tell me not\n"+
		"Wherein I seem unnatural: desire not\n"+
		"To ally my rages and revenges with\n"+
		"Your colder reasons.\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"O, no more, no more!\n"+
		"You have said you will not grant us any thing;\n"+
		"For we have nothing else to ask, but that\n"+
		"Which you deny already: yet we will ask;\n"+
		"That, if you fail in our request, the blame\n"+
		"May hang upon your hardness: therefore hear us.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for we'll\n"+
		"Hear nought from Rome in private. Your request?\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment\n"+
		"And state of bodies would bewray what life\n"+
		"We have led since thy exile. Think with thyself\n"+
		"How more unfortunate than all living women\n"+
		"Are we come hither: since that thy sight,\n"+
		"which should\n"+
		"Make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance\n"+
		"with comforts,\n"+
		"Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow;\n"+
		"Making the mother, wife and child to see\n"+
		"The son, the husband and the father tearing\n"+
		"His country's bowels out. And to poor we\n"+
		"Thine enmity's most capital: thou barr'st us\n"+
		"Our prayers to the gods, which is a comfort\n"+
		"That all but we enjoy; for how can we,\n"+
		"Alas, how can we for our country pray.\n"+
		"Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory,\n"+
		"Whereto we are bound? alack, or we must lose\n"+
		"The country, our dear nurse, or else thy person,\n"+
		"Our comfort in the country. We must find\n"+
		"An evident calamity, though we had\n"+
		"Our wish, which side should win: for either thou\n"+
		"Must, as a foreign recreant, be led\n"+
		"With manacles thorough our streets, or else\n"+
		"triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin,\n"+
		"And bear the palm for having bravely shed\n"+
		"Thy wife and children's blood. For myself, son,\n"+
		"I purpose not to wait on fortune till\n"+
		"These wars determine: if I cannot persuade thee\n"+
		"Rather to show a noble grace to both parts\n"+
		"Than seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner\n"+
		"March to assault thy country than to tread--\n"+
		"Trust to't, thou shalt not--on thy mother's womb,\n"+
		"That brought thee to this world.\n"+
		"VIRGILIA\n"+
		"Ay, and mine,\n"+
		"That brought you forth this boy, to keep your name\n"+
		"Living to time.\n"+
		"Young MARCIUS\n"+
		"A' shall not tread on me;\n"+
		"I'll run away till I am bigger, but then I'll fight.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Not of a woman's tenderness to be,\n"+
		"Requires nor child nor woman's face to see.\n"+
		"I have sat too long.\n"+
		"Rising\n"+
		"VOLUMNIA\n"+
		"Nay, go not from us thus.\n"+
		"If it were so that our request did tend\n"+
		"To save the Romans, thereby to destroy\n"+
		"The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us,\n"+
		"As poisonous of your honour: no; our suit\n"+
		"Is that you reconcile them: while the Volsces\n"+
		"May say 'This mercy we have show'd;' the Romans,\n"+
		"'This we received;' and each in either side\n"+
		"Give the all-hail to thee and cry 'Be blest\n"+
		"For making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son,\n"+
		"The end of war's uncertain, but this certain,\n"+
		"That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit\n"+
		"Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name,\n"+
		"Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses;\n"+
		"Whose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble,\n"+
		"But with his last attempt he wiped it out;\n"+
		"Destroy'd his country, and his name remains\n"+
		"To the ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son:\n"+
		"Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,\n"+
		"To imitate the graces of the gods;\n"+
		"To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air,\n"+
		"And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt\n"+
		"That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?\n"+
		"Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man\n"+
		"Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:\n"+
		"He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy:\n"+
		"Perhaps thy childishness will move him more\n"+
		"Than can our reasons. There's no man in the world\n"+
		"More bound to 's mother; yet here he lets me prate\n"+
		"Like one i' the stocks. Thou hast never in thy life\n"+
		"Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy,\n"+
		"When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,\n"+
		"Has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home,\n"+
		"Loaden with honour. Say my request's unjust,\n"+
		"And spurn me back: but if it be not so,\n"+
		"Thou art not honest; and the gods will plague thee,\n"+
		"That thou restrain'st from me the duty which\n"+
		"To a mother's part belongs. He turns away:\n"+
		"Down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.\n"+
		"To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride\n"+
		"Than pity to our prayers. Down: an end;\n"+
		"This is the last: so we will home to Rome,\n"+
		"And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold 's:\n"+
		"This boy, that cannot tell what he would have\n"+
		"But kneels and holds up bands for fellowship,\n"+
		"Does reason our petition with more strength\n"+
		"Than thou hast to deny 't. Come, let us go:\n"+
		"This fellow had a Volscian to his mother;\n"+
		"His wife is in Corioli and his child\n"+
		"Like him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch:\n"+
		"I am hush'd until our city be a-fire,\n"+
		"And then I'll speak a little.\n"+
		"He holds her by the hand, silent\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"O mother, mother!\n"+
		"What have you done? Behold, the heavens do ope,\n"+
		"The gods look down, and this unnatural scene\n"+
		"They laugh at. O my mother, mother! O!\n"+
		"You have won a happy victory to Rome;\n"+
		"But, for your son,--believe it, O, believe it,\n"+
		"Most dangerously you have with him prevail'd,\n"+
		"If not most mortal to him. But, let it come.\n"+
		"Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars,\n"+
		"I'll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius,\n"+
		"Were you in my stead, would you have heard\n"+
		"A mother less? or granted less, Aufidius?\n"+
		"AUFIDIUS\n"+
		"I was moved withal.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"I dare be sworn you were:\n"+
		"And, sir, it is no little thing to make\n"+
		"Mine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good sir,\n"+
		"What peace you'll make, advise me: for my part,\n"+
		"I'll not to Rome, I'll back with you; and pray you,\n"+
		"Stand to me in this cause. O mother! wife!\n"+
		"AUFIDIUS\n"+
		"[Aside] I am glad thou hast set thy mercy and\n"+
		"thy honour\n"+
		"At difference in thee: out of that I'll work\n"+
		"Myself a former fortune.\n"+
		"The Ladies make signs to CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Ay, by and by;\n"+
		"To VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, & c\n"+
		"But we will drink together; and you shall bear\n"+
		"A better witness back than words, which we,\n"+
		"On like conditions, will have counter-seal'd.\n"+
		"Come, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve\n"+
		"To have a temple built you: all the swords\n"+
		"In Italy, and her confederate arms,\n"+
		"Could not have made this peace.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV. Rome. A public place.\n"+
		"Enter MENENIUS and SICINIUS\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"See you yond coign o' the Capitol, yond\n"+
		"corner-stone?\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Why, what of that?\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"If it be possible for you to displace it with your\n"+
		"little finger, there is some hope the ladies of\n"+
		"Rome, especially his mother, may prevail with him.\n"+
		"But I say there is no hope in't: our throats are\n"+
		"sentenced and stay upon execution.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Is't possible that so short a time can alter the\n"+
		"condition of a man!\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"There is differency between a grub and a butterfly;\n"+
		"yet your butterfly was a grub. This Marcius is grown\n"+
		"from man to dragon: he has wings; he's more than a\n"+
		"creeping thing.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"He loved his mother dearly.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"So did he me: and he no more remembers his mother\n"+
		"now than an eight-year-old horse. The tartness\n"+
		"of his face sours ripe grapes: when he walks, he\n"+
		"moves like an engine, and the ground shrinks before\n"+
		"his treading: he is able to pierce a corslet with\n"+
		"his eye; talks like a knell, and his hum is a\n"+
		"battery. He sits in his state, as a thing made for\n"+
		"Alexander. What he bids be done is finished with\n"+
		"his bidding. He wants nothing of a god but eternity\n"+
		"and a heaven to throne in.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Yes, mercy, if you report him truly.\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"I paint him in the character. Mark what mercy his\n"+
		"mother shall bring from him: there is no more mercy\n"+
		"in him than there is milk in a male tiger; that\n"+
		"shall our poor city find: and all this is long of\n"+
		"you.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"The gods be good unto us!\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"No, in such a case the gods will not be good unto\n"+
		"us. When we banished him, we respected not them;\n"+
		"and, he returning to break our necks, they respect not us.\n"+
		"Enter a Messenger\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Sir, if you'ld save your life, fly to your house:\n"+
		"The plebeians have got your fellow-tribune\n"+
		"And hale him up and down, all swearing, if\n"+
		"The Roman ladies bring not comfort home,\n"+
		"They'll give him death by inches.\n"+
		"Enter a second Messenger\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"What's the news?\n"+
		"Second Messenger\n"+
		"Good news, good news; the ladies have prevail'd,\n"+
		"The Volscians are dislodged, and Marcius gone:\n"+
		"A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,\n"+
		"No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"Friend,\n"+
		"Art thou certain this is true? is it most certain?\n"+
		"Second Messenger\n"+
		"As certain as I know the sun is fire:\n"+
		"Where have you lurk'd, that you make doubt of it?\n"+
		"Ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide,\n"+
		"As the recomforted through the gates. Why, hark you!\n"+
		"Trumpets; hautboys; drums beat; all together\n"+
		"The trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries and fifes,\n"+
		"Tabours and cymbals and the shouting Romans,\n"+
		"Make the sun dance. Hark you!\n"+
		"A shout within\n"+
		"MENENIUS\n"+
		"This is good news:\n"+
		"I will go meet the ladies. This Volumnia\n"+
		"Is worth of consuls, senators, patricians,\n"+
		"A city full; of tribunes, such as you,\n"+
		"A sea and land full. You have pray'd well to-day:\n"+
		"This morning for ten thousand of your throats\n"+
		"I'd not have given a doit. Hark, how they joy!\n"+
		"Music still, with shouts\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"First, the gods bless you for your tidings; next,\n"+
		"Accept my thankfulness.\n"+
		"Second Messenger\n"+
		"Sir, we have all\n"+
		"Great cause to give great thanks.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"They are near the city?\n"+
		"Second Messenger\n"+
		"Almost at point to enter.\n"+
		"SICINIUS\n"+
		"We will meet them,\n"+
		"And help the joy.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE V. The same. A street near the gate.\n"+
		"Enter two Senators with VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, VALERIA, & c. passing over the stage, followed by Patricians and others\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"Behold our patroness, the life of Rome!\n"+
		"Call all your tribes together, praise the gods,\n"+
		"And make triumphant fires; strew flowers before them:\n"+
		"Unshout the noise that banish'd Marcius,\n"+
		"Repeal him with the welcome of his mother;\n"+
		"Cry 'Welcome, ladies, welcome!'\n"+
		"All\n"+
		"Welcome, ladies, Welcome!\n"+
		"A flourish with drums and trumpets. Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE VI. Antium. A public place.\n"+
		"Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS, with Attendants\n"+
		"AUFIDIUS\n"+
		"Go tell the lords o' the city I am here:\n"+
		"Deliver them this paper: having read it,\n"+
		"Bid them repair to the market place; where I,\n"+
		"Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,\n"+
		"Will vouch the truth of it. Him I accuse\n"+
		"The city ports by this hath enter'd and\n"+
		"Intends to appear before the people, hoping\n"+
		"To purge herself with words: dispatch.\n"+
		"Exeunt Attendants\n"+
		"Enter three or four Conspirators of AUFIDIUS' faction\n"+
		"Most welcome!\n"+
		"First Conspirator\n"+
		"How is it with our general?\n"+
		"AUFIDIUS\n"+
		"Even so\n"+
		"As with a man by his own alms empoison'd,\n"+
		"And with his charity slain.\n"+
		"Second Conspirator\n"+
		"Most noble sir,\n"+
		"If you do hold the same intent wherein\n"+
		"You wish'd us parties, we'll deliver you\n"+
		"Of your great danger.\n"+
		"AUFIDIUS\n"+
		"Sir, I cannot tell:\n"+
		"We must proceed as we do find the people.\n"+
		"Third Conspirator\n"+
		"The people will remain uncertain whilst\n"+
		"'Twixt you there's difference; but the fall of either\n"+
		"Makes the survivor heir of all.\n"+
		"AUFIDIUS\n"+
		"I know it;\n"+
		"And my pretext to strike at him admits\n"+
		"A good construction. I raised him, and I pawn'd\n"+
		"Mine honour for his truth: who being so heighten'd,\n"+
		"He water'd his new plants with dews of flattery,\n"+
		"Seducing so my friends; and, to this end,\n"+
		"He bow'd his nature, never known before\n"+
		"But to be rough, unswayable and free.\n"+
		"Third Conspirator\n"+
		"Sir, his stoutness\n"+
		"When he did stand for consul, which he lost\n"+
		"By lack of stooping,--\n"+
		"AUFIDIUS\n"+
		"That I would have spoke of:\n"+
		"Being banish'd for't, he came unto my hearth;\n"+
		"Presented to my knife his throat: I took him;\n"+
		"Made him joint-servant with me; gave him way\n"+
		"In all his own desires; nay, let him choose\n"+
		"Out of my files, his projects to accomplish,\n"+
		"My best and freshest men; served his designments\n"+
		"In mine own person; holp to reap the fame\n"+
		"Which he did end all his; and took some pride\n"+
		"To do myself this wrong: till, at the last,\n"+
		"I seem'd his follower, not partner, and\n"+
		"He waged me with his countenance, as if\n"+
		"I had been mercenary.\n"+
		"First Conspirator\n"+
		"So he did, my lord:\n"+
		"The army marvell'd at it, and, in the last,\n"+
		"When he had carried Rome and that we look'd\n"+
		"For no less spoil than glory,--\n"+
		"AUFIDIUS\n"+
		"There was it:\n"+
		"For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him.\n"+
		"At a few drops of women's rheum, which are\n"+
		"As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labour\n"+
		"Of our great action: therefore shall he die,\n"+
		"And I'll renew me in his fall. But, hark!\n"+
		"Drums and trumpets sound, with great shouts of the People\n"+
		"First Conspirator\n"+
		"Your native town you enter'd like a post,\n"+
		"And had no welcomes home: but he returns,\n"+
		"Splitting the air with noise.\n"+
		"Second Conspirator\n"+
		"And patient fools,\n"+
		"Whose children he hath slain, their base throats tear\n"+
		"With giving him glory.\n"+
		"Third Conspirator\n"+
		"Therefore, at your vantage,\n"+
		"Ere he express himself, or move the people\n"+
		"With what he would say, let him feel your sword,\n"+
		"Which we will second. When he lies along,\n"+
		"After your way his tale pronounced shall bury\n"+
		"His reasons with his body.\n"+
		"AUFIDIUS\n"+
		"Say no more:\n"+
		"Here come the lords.\n"+
		"Enter the Lords of the city\n"+
		"All The Lords\n"+
		"You are most welcome home.\n"+
		"AUFIDIUS\n"+
		"I have not deserved it.\n"+
		"But, worthy lords, have you with heed perused\n"+
		"What I have written to you?\n"+
		"Lords\n"+
		"We have.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"And grieve to hear't.\n"+
		"What faults he made before the last, I think\n"+
		"Might have found easy fines: but there to end\n"+
		"Where he was to begin and give away\n"+
		"The benefit of our levies, answering us\n"+
		"With our own charge, making a treaty where\n"+
		"There was a yielding,--this admits no excuse.\n"+
		"AUFIDIUS\n"+
		"He approaches: you shall hear him.\n"+
		"Enter CORIOLANUS, marching with drum and colours; commoners being with him\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Hail, lords! I am return'd your soldier,\n"+
		"No more infected with my country's love\n"+
		"Than when I parted hence, but still subsisting\n"+
		"Under your great command. You are to know\n"+
		"That prosperously I have attempted and\n"+
		"With bloody passage led your wars even to\n"+
		"The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home\n"+
		"Do more than counterpoise a full third part\n"+
		"The charges of the action. We have made peace\n"+
		"With no less honour to the Antiates\n"+
		"Than shame to the Romans: and we here deliver,\n"+
		"Subscribed by the consuls and patricians,\n"+
		"Together with the seal o' the senate, what\n"+
		"We have compounded on.\n"+
		"AUFIDIUS\n"+
		"Read it not, noble lords;\n"+
		"But tell the traitor, in the high'st degree\n"+
		"He hath abused your powers.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Traitor! how now!\n"+
		"AUFIDIUS\n"+
		"Ay, traitor, Marcius!\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Marcius!\n"+
		"AUFIDIUS\n"+
		"Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius: dost thou think\n"+
		"I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol'n name\n"+
		"Coriolanus in Corioli?\n"+
		"You lords and heads o' the state, perfidiously\n"+
		"He has betray'd your business, and given up,\n"+
		"For certain drops of salt, your city Rome,\n"+
		"I say 'your city,' to his wife and mother;\n"+
		"Breaking his oath and resolution like\n"+
		"A twist of rotten silk, never admitting\n"+
		"Counsel o' the war, but at his nurse's tears\n"+
		"He whined and roar'd away your victory,\n"+
		"That pages blush'd at him and men of heart\n"+
		"Look'd wondering each at other.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Hear'st thou, Mars?\n"+
		"AUFIDIUS\n"+
		"Name not the god, thou boy of tears!\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Ha!\n"+
		"AUFIDIUS\n"+
		"No more.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart\n"+
		"Too great for what contains it. Boy! O slave!\n"+
		"Pardon me, lords, 'tis the first time that ever\n"+
		"I was forced to scold. Your judgments, my grave lords,\n"+
		"Must give this cur the lie: and his own notion--\n"+
		"Who wears my stripes impress'd upon him; that\n"+
		"Must bear my beating to his grave--shall join\n"+
		"To thrust the lie unto him.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"Peace, both, and hear me speak.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"Cut me to pieces, Volsces; men and lads,\n"+
		"Stain all your edges on me. Boy! false hound!\n"+
		"If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there,\n"+
		"That, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I\n"+
		"Flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli:\n"+
		"Alone I did it. Boy!\n"+
		"AUFIDIUS\n"+
		"Why, noble lords,\n"+
		"Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune,\n"+
		"Which was your shame, by this unholy braggart,\n"+
		"'Fore your own eyes and ears?\n"+
		"All Conspirators\n"+
		"Let him die for't.\n"+
		"All The People\n"+
		"'Tear him to pieces.' 'Do it presently.' 'He kill'd\n"+
		"my son.' 'My daughter.' 'He killed my cousin\n"+
		"Marcus.' 'He killed my father.'\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"Peace, ho! no outrage: peace!\n"+
		"The man is noble and his fame folds-in\n"+
		"This orb o' the earth. His last offences to us\n"+
		"Shall have judicious hearing. Stand, Aufidius,\n"+
		"And trouble not the peace.\n"+
		"CORIOLANUS\n"+
		"O that I had him,\n"+
		"With six Aufidiuses, or more, his tribe,\n"+
		"To use my lawful sword!\n"+
		"AUFIDIUS\n"+
		"Insolent villain!\n"+
		"All Conspirators\n"+
		"Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him!\n"+
		"The Conspirators draw, and kill CORIOLANUS: AUFIDIUS stands on his body\n"+
		"Lords\n"+
		"Hold, hold, hold, hold!\n"+
		"AUFIDIUS\n"+
		"My noble masters, hear me speak.\n"+
