		"Antony and Cleopatra\n"+
		"ACT I\n"+
		"SCENE I. Alexandria. A room in CLEOPATRA's palace.\n"+
		"Enter DEMETRIUS and PHILO\n"+
		"PHILO\n"+
		"Nay, but this dotage of our general's\n"+
		"O'erflows the measure: those his goodly eyes,\n"+
		"That o'er the files and musters of the war\n"+
		"Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,\n"+
		"The office and devotion of their view\n"+
		"Upon a tawny front: his captain's heart,\n"+
		"Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst\n"+
		"The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,\n"+
		"And is become the bellows and the fan\n"+
		"To cool a gipsy's lust.\n"+
		"Flourish. Enter ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, her Ladies, the Train, with Eunuchs fanning her\n"+
		"Look, where they come:\n"+
		"Take but good note, and you shall see in him.\n"+
		"The triple pillar of the world transform'd\n"+
		"Into a strumpet's fool: behold and see.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"If it be love indeed, tell me how much.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.\n"+
		"Enter an Attendant\n"+
		"Attendant\n"+
		"News, my good lord, from Rome.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Grates me: the sum.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Nay, hear them, Antony:\n"+
		"Fulvia perchance is angry; or, who knows\n"+
		"If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent\n"+
		"His powerful mandate to you, 'Do this, or this;\n"+
		"Take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that;\n"+
		"Perform 't, or else we damn thee.'\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"How, my love!\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Perchance! nay, and most like:\n"+
		"You must not stay here longer, your dismission\n"+
		"Is come from Caesar; therefore hear it, Antony.\n"+
		"Where's Fulvia's process? Caesar's I would say? both?\n"+
		"Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt's queen,\n"+
		"Thou blushest, Antony; and that blood of thine\n"+
		"Is Caesar's homager: else so thy cheek pays shame\n"+
		"When shrill-tongued Fulvia scolds. The messengers!\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch\n"+
		"Of the ranged empire fall! Here is my space.\n"+
		"Kingdoms are clay: our dungy earth alike\n"+
		"Feeds beast as man: the nobleness of life\n"+
		"Is to do thus; when such a mutual pair\n"+
		"Embracing\n"+
		"And such a twain can do't, in which I bind,\n"+
		"On pain of punishment, the world to weet\n"+
		"We stand up peerless.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Excellent falsehood!\n"+
		"Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her?\n"+
		"I'll seem the fool I am not; Antony\n"+
		"Will be himself.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"But stirr'd by Cleopatra.\n"+
		"Now, for the love of Love and her soft hours,\n"+
		"Let's not confound the time with conference harsh:\n"+
		"There's not a minute of our lives should stretch\n"+
		"Without some pleasure now. What sport tonight?\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Hear the ambassadors.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Fie, wrangling queen!\n"+
		"Whom every thing becomes, to chide, to laugh,\n"+
		"To weep; whose every passion fully strives\n"+
		"To make itself, in thee, fair and admired!\n"+
		"No messenger, but thine; and all alone\n"+
		"To-night we'll wander through the streets and note\n"+
		"The qualities of people. Come, my queen;\n"+
		"Last night you did desire it: speak not to us.\n"+
		"Exeunt MARK ANTONY and CLEOPATRA with their train\n"+
		"DEMETRIUS\n"+
		"Is Caesar with Antonius prized so slight?\n"+
		"PHILO\n"+
		"Sir, sometimes, when he is not Antony,\n"+
		"He comes too short of that great property\n"+
		"Which still should go with Antony.\n"+
		"DEMETRIUS\n"+
		"I am full sorry\n"+
		"That he approves the common liar, who\n"+
		"Thus speaks of him at Rome: but I will hope\n"+
		"Of better deeds to-morrow. Rest you happy!\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. The same. Another room.\n"+
		"Enter CHARMIAN, IRAS, ALEXAS, and a Soothsayer\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most any thing Alexas,\n"+
		"almost most absolute Alexas, where's the soothsayer\n"+
		"that you praised so to the queen? O, that I knew\n"+
		"this husband, which, you say, must charge his horns\n"+
		"with garlands!\n"+
		"ALEXAS\n"+
		"Soothsayer!\n"+
		"Soothsayer\n"+
		"Your will?\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"Is this the man? Is't you, sir, that know things?\n"+
		"Soothsayer\n"+
		"In nature's infinite book of secrecy\n"+
		"A little I can read.\n"+
		"ALEXAS\n"+
		"Show him your hand.\n"+
		"Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"Bring in the banquet quickly; wine enough\n"+
		"Cleopatra's health to drink.\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"Good sir, give me good fortune.\n"+
		"Soothsayer\n"+
		"I make not, but foresee.\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"Pray, then, foresee me one.\n"+
		"Soothsayer\n"+
		"You shall be yet far fairer than you are.\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"He means in flesh.\n"+
		"IRAS\n"+
		"No, you shall paint when you are old.\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"Wrinkles forbid!\n"+
		"ALEXAS\n"+
		"Vex not his prescience; be attentive.\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"Hush!\n"+
		"Soothsayer\n"+
		"You shall be more beloving than beloved.\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"I had rather heat my liver with drinking.\n"+
		"ALEXAS\n"+
		"Nay, hear him.\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me be married\n"+
		"to three kings in a forenoon, and widow them all:\n"+
		"let me have a child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewry\n"+
		"may do homage: find me to marry me with Octavius\n"+
		"Caesar, and companion me with my mistress.\n"+
		"Soothsayer\n"+
		"You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"O excellent! I love long life better than figs.\n"+
		"Soothsayer\n"+
		"You have seen and proved a fairer former fortune\n"+
		"Than that which is to approach.\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"Then belike my children shall have no names:\n"+
		"prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have?\n"+
		"Soothsayer\n"+
		"If every of your wishes had a womb.\n"+
		"And fertile every wish, a million.\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"Out, fool! I forgive thee for a witch.\n"+
		"ALEXAS\n"+
		"You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"Nay, come, tell Iras hers.\n"+
		"ALEXAS\n"+
		"We'll know all our fortunes.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"Mine, and most of our fortunes, to-night, shall\n"+
		"be--drunk to bed.\n"+
		"IRAS\n"+
		"There's a palm presages chastity, if nothing else.\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"E'en as the o'erflowing Nilus presageth famine.\n"+
		"IRAS\n"+
		"Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay.\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful\n"+
		"prognostication, I cannot scratch mine ear. Prithee,\n"+
		"tell her but a worky-day fortune.\n"+
		"Soothsayer\n"+
		"Your fortunes are alike.\n"+
		"IRAS\n"+
		"But how, but how? give me particulars.\n"+
		"Soothsayer\n"+
		"I have said.\n"+
		"IRAS\n"+
		"Am I not an inch of fortune better than she?\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than\n"+
		"I, where would you choose it?\n"+
		"IRAS\n"+
		"Not in my husband's nose.\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"Our worser thoughts heavens mend! Alexas,--come,\n"+
		"his fortune, his fortune! O, let him marry a woman\n"+
		"that cannot go, sweet Isis, I beseech thee! and let\n"+
		"her die too, and give him a worse! and let worst\n"+
		"follow worse, till the worst of all follow him\n"+
		"laughing to his grave, fifty-fold a cuckold! Good\n"+
		"Isis, hear me this prayer, though thou deny me a\n"+
		"matter of more weight; good Isis, I beseech thee!\n"+
		"IRAS\n"+
		"Amen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people!\n"+
		"for, as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man\n"+
		"loose-wived, so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a\n"+
		"foul knave uncuckolded: therefore, dear Isis, keep\n"+
		"decorum, and fortune him accordingly!\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"Amen.\n"+
		"ALEXAS\n"+
		"Lo, now, if it lay in their hands to make me a\n"+
		"cuckold, they would make themselves whores, but\n"+
		"they'ld do't!\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"Hush! here comes Antony.\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"Not he; the queen.\n"+
		"Enter CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Saw you my lord?\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"No, lady.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Was he not here?\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"No, madam.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"He was disposed to mirth; but on the sudden\n"+
		"A Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"Madam?\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Seek him, and bring him hither.\n"+
		"Where's Alexas?\n"+
		"ALEXAS\n"+
		"Here, at your service. My lord approaches.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"We will not look upon him: go with us.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"Enter MARK ANTONY with a Messenger and Attendants\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Fulvia thy wife first came into the field.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Against my brother Lucius?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Ay:\n"+
		"But soon that war had end, and the time's state\n"+
		"Made friends of them, joining their force 'gainst Caesar;\n"+
		"Whose better issue in the war, from Italy,\n"+
		"Upon the first encounter, drave them.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Well, what worst?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"The nature of bad news infects the teller.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"When it concerns the fool or coward. On:\n"+
		"Things that are past are done with me. 'Tis thus:\n"+
		"Who tells me true, though in his tale lie death,\n"+
		"I hear him as he flatter'd.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Labienus--\n"+
		"This is stiff news--hath, with his Parthian force,\n"+
		"Extended Asia from Euphrates;\n"+
		"His conquering banner shook from Syria\n"+
		"To Lydia and to Ionia; Whilst--\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Antony, thou wouldst say,--\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"O, my lord!\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Speak to me home, mince not the general tongue:\n"+
		"Name Cleopatra as she is call'd in Rome;\n"+
		"Rail thou in Fulvia's phrase; and taunt my faults\n"+
		"With such full licence as both truth and malice\n"+
		"Have power to utter. O, then we bring forth weeds,\n"+
		"When our quick minds lie still; and our ills told us\n"+
		"Is as our earing. Fare thee well awhile.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"At your noble pleasure.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"From Sicyon, ho, the news! Speak there!\n"+
		"First Attendant\n"+
		"The man from Sicyon,--is there such an one?\n"+
		"Second Attendant\n"+
		"He stays upon your will.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Let him appear.\n"+
		"These strong Egyptian fetters I must break,\n"+
		"Or lose myself in dotage.\n"+
		"Enter another Messenger\n"+
		"What are you?\n"+
		"Second Messenger\n"+
		"Fulvia thy wife is dead.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Where died she?\n"+
		"Second Messenger\n"+
		"In Sicyon:\n"+
		"Her length of sickness, with what else more serious\n"+
		"Importeth thee to know, this bears.\n"+
		"Gives a letter\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Forbear me.\n"+
		"Exit Second Messenger\n"+
		"There's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it:\n"+
		"What our contempt doth often hurl from us,\n"+
		"We wish it ours again; the present pleasure,\n"+
		"By revolution lowering, does become\n"+
		"The opposite of itself: she's good, being gone;\n"+
		"The hand could pluck her back that shoved her on.\n"+
		"I must from this enchanting queen break off:\n"+
		"Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know,\n"+
		"My idleness doth hatch. How now! Enobarbus!\n"+
		"Re-enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"What's your pleasure, sir?\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"I must with haste from hence.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"Why, then, we kill all our women:\n"+
		"we see how mortal an unkindness is to them;\n"+
		"if they suffer our departure, death's the word.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"I must be gone.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"Under a compelling occasion, let women die; it were\n"+
		"pity to cast them away for nothing; though, between\n"+
		"them and a great cause, they should be esteemed\n"+
		"nothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of\n"+
		"this, dies instantly; I have seen her die twenty\n"+
		"times upon far poorer moment: I do think there is\n"+
		"mettle in death, which commits some loving act upon\n"+
		"her, she hath such a celerity in dying.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"She is cunning past man's thought.\n"+
		"Exit ALEXAS\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"Alack, sir, no; her passions are made of nothing but\n"+
		"the finest part of pure love: we cannot call her\n"+
		"winds and waters sighs and tears; they are greater\n"+
		"storms and tempests than almanacs can report: this\n"+
		"cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she makes a\n"+
		"shower of rain as well as Jove.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Would I had never seen her.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"O, sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece\n"+
		"of work; which not to have been blest withal would\n"+
		"have discredited your travel.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Fulvia is dead.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"Sir?\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Fulvia is dead.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"Fulvia!\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Dead.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When\n"+
		"it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man\n"+
		"from him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth;\n"+
		"comforting therein, that when old robes are worn\n"+
		"out, there are members to make new. If there were\n"+
		"no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut,\n"+
		"and the case to be lamented: this grief is crowned\n"+
		"with consolation; your old smock brings forth a new\n"+
		"petticoat: and indeed the tears live in an onion\n"+
		"that should water this sorrow.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"The business she hath broached in the state\n"+
		"Cannot endure my absence.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"And the business you have broached here cannot be\n"+
		"without you; especially that of Cleopatra's, which\n"+
		"wholly depends on your abode.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"No more light answers. Let our officers\n"+
		"Have notice what we purpose. I shall break\n"+
		"The cause of our expedience to the queen,\n"+
		"And get her leave to part. For not alone\n"+
		"The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,\n"+
		"Do strongly speak to us; but the letters too\n"+
		"Of many our contriving friends in Rome\n"+
		"Petition us at home: Sextus Pompeius\n"+
		"Hath given the dare to Caesar, and commands\n"+
		"The empire of the sea: our slippery people,\n"+
		"Whose love is never link'd to the deserver\n"+
		"Till his deserts are past, begin to throw\n"+
		"Pompey the Great and all his dignities\n"+
		"Upon his son; who, high in name and power,\n"+
		"Higher than both in blood and life, stands up\n"+
		"For the main soldier: whose quality, going on,\n"+
		"The sides o' the world may danger: much is breeding,\n"+
		"Which, like the courser's hair, hath yet but life,\n"+
		"And not a serpent's poison. Say, our pleasure,\n"+
		"To such whose place is under us, requires\n"+
		"Our quick remove from hence.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"I shall do't.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. The same. Another room.\n"+
		"Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Where is he?\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"I did not see him since.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"See where he is, who's with him, what he does:\n"+
		"I did not send you: if you find him sad,\n"+
		"Say I am dancing; if in mirth, report\n"+
		"That I am sudden sick: quick, and return.\n"+
		"Exit ALEXAS\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"Madam, methinks, if you did love him dearly,\n"+
		"You do not hold the method to enforce\n"+
		"The like from him.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"What should I do, I do not?\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"In each thing give him way, cross him nothing.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Thou teachest like a fool; the way to lose him.\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"Tempt him not so too far; I wish, forbear:\n"+
		"In time we hate that which we often fear.\n"+
		"But here comes Antony.\n"+
		"Enter MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"I am sick and sullen.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose,--\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Help me away, dear Charmian; I shall fall:\n"+
		"It cannot be thus long, the sides of nature\n"+
		"Will not sustain it.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Now, my dearest queen,--\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Pray you, stand further from me.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"What's the matter?\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"I know, by that same eye, there's some good news.\n"+
		"What says the married woman? You may go:\n"+
		"Would she had never given you leave to come!\n"+
		"Let her not say 'tis I that keep you here:\n"+
		"I have no power upon you; hers you are.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"The gods best know,--\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"O, never was there queen\n"+
		"So mightily betray'd! yet at the first\n"+
		"I saw the treasons planted.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Cleopatra,--\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Why should I think you can be mine and true,\n"+
		"Though you in swearing shake the throned gods,\n"+
		"Who have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness,\n"+
		"To be entangled with those mouth-made vows,\n"+
		"Which break themselves in swearing!\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Most sweet queen,--\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Nay, pray you, seek no colour for your going,\n"+
		"But bid farewell, and go: when you sued staying,\n"+
		"Then was the time for words: no going then;\n"+
		"Eternity was in our lips and eyes,\n"+
		"Bliss in our brows' bent; none our parts so poor,\n"+
		"But was a race of heaven: they are so still,\n"+
		"Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world,\n"+
		"Art turn'd the greatest liar.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"How now, lady!\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"I would I had thy inches; thou shouldst know\n"+
		"There were a heart in Egypt.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Hear me, queen:\n"+
		"The strong necessity of time commands\n"+
		"Our services awhile; but my full heart\n"+
		"Remains in use with you. Our Italy\n"+
		"Shines o'er with civil swords: Sextus Pompeius\n"+
		"Makes his approaches to the port of Rome:\n"+
		"Equality of two domestic powers\n"+
		"Breed scrupulous faction: the hated, grown to strength,\n"+
		"Are newly grown to love: the condemn'd Pompey,\n"+
		"Rich in his father's honour, creeps apace,\n"+
		"Into the hearts of such as have not thrived\n"+
		"Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten;\n"+
		"And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge\n"+
		"By any desperate change: my more particular,\n"+
		"And that which most with you should safe my going,\n"+
		"Is Fulvia's death.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Though age from folly could not give me freedom,\n"+
		"It does from childishness: can Fulvia die?\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"She's dead, my queen:\n"+
		"Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read\n"+
		"The garboils she awaked; at the last, best:\n"+
		"See when and where she died.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"O most false love!\n"+
		"Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill\n"+
		"With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,\n"+
		"In Fulvia's death, how mine received shall be.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Quarrel no more, but be prepared to know\n"+
		"The purposes I bear; which are, or cease,\n"+
		"As you shall give the advice. By the fire\n"+
		"That quickens Nilus' slime, I go from hence\n"+
		"Thy soldier, servant; making peace or war\n"+
		"As thou affect'st.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Cut my lace, Charmian, come;\n"+
		"But let it be: I am quickly ill, and well,\n"+
		"So Antony loves.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"My precious queen, forbear;\n"+
		"And give true evidence to his love, which stands\n"+
		"An honourable trial.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"So Fulvia told me.\n"+
		"I prithee, turn aside and weep for her,\n"+
		"Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears\n"+
		"Belong to Egypt: good now, play one scene\n"+
		"Of excellent dissembling; and let it look\n"+
		"Life perfect honour.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"You'll heat my blood: no more.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"You can do better yet; but this is meetly.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Now, by my sword,--\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"And target. Still he mends;\n"+
		"But this is not the best. Look, prithee, Charmian,\n"+
		"How this Herculean Roman does become\n"+
		"The carriage of his chafe.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"I'll leave you, lady.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Courteous lord, one word.\n"+
		"Sir, you and I must part, but that's not it:\n"+
		"Sir, you and I have loved, but there's not it;\n"+
		"That you know well: something it is I would,\n"+
		"O, my oblivion is a very Antony,\n"+
		"And I am all forgotten.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"But that your royalty\n"+
		"Holds idleness your subject, I should take you\n"+
		"For idleness itself.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"'Tis sweating labour\n"+
		"To bear such idleness so near the heart\n"+
		"As Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me;\n"+
		"Since my becomings kill me, when they do not\n"+
		"Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;\n"+
		"Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly.\n"+
		"And all the gods go with you! upon your sword\n"+
		"Sit laurel victory! and smooth success\n"+
		"Be strew'd before your feet!\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Let us go. Come;\n"+
		"Our separation so abides, and flies,\n"+
		"That thou, residing here, go'st yet with me,\n"+
		"And I, hence fleeting, here remain with thee. Away!\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV. Rome. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.\n"+
		"Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, reading a letter, LEPIDUS, and their Train\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,\n"+
		"It is not Caesar's natural vice to hate\n"+
		"Our great competitor: from Alexandria\n"+
		"This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes\n"+
		"The lamps of night in revel; is not more man-like\n"+
		"Than Cleopatra; nor the queen of Ptolemy\n"+
		"More womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or\n"+
		"Vouchsafed to think he had partners: you shall find there\n"+
		"A man who is the abstract of all faults\n"+
		"That all men follow.\n"+
		"LEPIDUS\n"+
		"I must not think there are\n"+
		"Evils enow to darken all his goodness:\n"+
		"His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven,\n"+
		"More fiery by night's blackness; hereditary,\n"+
		"Rather than purchased; what he cannot change,\n"+
		"Than what he chooses.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"You are too indulgent. Let us grant, it is not\n"+
		"Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy;\n"+
		"To give a kingdom for a mirth; to sit\n"+
		"And keep the turn of tippling with a slave;\n"+
		"To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet\n"+
		"With knaves that smell of sweat: say this\n"+
		"becomes him,--\n"+
		"As his composure must be rare indeed\n"+
		"Whom these things cannot blemish,--yet must Antony\n"+
		"No way excuse his soils, when we do bear\n"+
		"So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd\n"+
		"His vacancy with his voluptuousness,\n"+
		"Full surfeits, and the dryness of his bones,\n"+
		"Call on him for't: but to confound such time,\n"+
		"That drums him from his sport, and speaks as loud\n"+
		"As his own state and ours,--'tis to be chid\n"+
		"As we rate boys, who, being mature in knowledge,\n"+
		"Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,\n"+
		"And so rebel to judgment.\n"+
		"Enter a Messenger\n"+
		"LEPIDUS\n"+
		"Here's more news.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Thy biddings have been done; and every hour,\n"+
		"Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have report\n"+
		"How 'tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea;\n"+
		"And it appears he is beloved of those\n"+
		"That only have fear'd Caesar: to the ports\n"+
		"The discontents repair, and men's reports\n"+
		"Give him much wrong'd.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"I should have known no less.\n"+
		"It hath been taught us from the primal state,\n"+
		"That he which is was wish'd until he were;\n"+
		"And the ebb'd man, ne'er loved till ne'er worth love,\n"+
		"Comes dear'd by being lack'd. This common body,\n"+
		"Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,\n"+
		"Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,\n"+
		"To rot itself with motion.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Caesar, I bring thee word,\n"+
		"Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates,\n"+
		"Make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound\n"+
		"With keels of every kind: many hot inroads\n"+
		"They make in Italy; the borders maritime\n"+
		"Lack blood to think on't, and flush youth revolt:\n"+
		"No vessel can peep forth, but 'tis as soon\n"+
		"Taken as seen; for Pompey's name strikes more\n"+
		"Than could his war resisted.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Antony,\n"+
		"Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once\n"+
		"Wast beaten from Modena, where thou slew'st\n"+
		"Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel\n"+
		"Did famine follow; whom thou fought'st against,\n"+
		"Though daintily brought up, with patience more\n"+
		"Than savages could suffer: thou didst drink\n"+
		"The stale of horses, and the gilded puddle\n"+
		"Which beasts would cough at: thy palate then did deign\n"+
		"The roughest berry on the rudest hedge;\n"+
		"Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets,\n"+
		"The barks of trees thou browsed'st; on the Alps\n"+
		"It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh,\n"+
		"Which some did die to look on: and all this--\n"+
		"It wounds thine honour that I speak it now--\n"+
		"Was borne so like a soldier, that thy cheek\n"+
		"So much as lank'd not.\n"+
		"LEPIDUS\n"+
		"'Tis pity of him.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Let his shames quickly\n"+
		"Drive him to Rome: 'tis time we twain\n"+
		"Did show ourselves i' the field; and to that end\n"+
		"Assemble we immediate council: Pompey\n"+
		"Thrives in our idleness.\n"+
		"LEPIDUS\n"+
		"To-morrow, Caesar,\n"+
		"I shall be furnish'd to inform you rightly\n"+
		"Both what by sea and land I can be able\n"+
		"To front this present time.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Till which encounter,\n"+
		"It is my business too. Farewell.\n"+
		"LEPIDUS\n"+
		"Farewell, my lord: what you shall know meantime\n"+
		"Of stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir,\n"+
		"To let me be partaker.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Doubt not, sir;\n"+
		"I knew it for my bond.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE V. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.\n"+
		"Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and MARDIAN\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Charmian!\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"Madam?\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Ha, ha!\n"+
		"Give me to drink mandragora.\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"Why, madam?\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"That I might sleep out this great gap of time\n"+
		"My Antony is away.\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"You think of him too much.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"O, 'tis treason!\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"Madam, I trust, not so.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Thou, eunuch Mardian!\n"+
		"MARDIAN\n"+
		"What's your highness' pleasure?\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Not now to hear thee sing; I take no pleasure\n"+
		"In aught an eunuch has: 'tis well for thee,\n"+
		"That, being unseminar'd, thy freer thoughts\n"+
		"May not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou affections?\n"+
		"MARDIAN\n"+
		"Yes, gracious madam.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Indeed!\n"+
		"MARDIAN\n"+
		"Not in deed, madam; for I can do nothing\n"+
		"But what indeed is honest to be done:\n"+
		"Yet have I fierce affections, and think\n"+
		"What Venus did with Mars.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"O Charmian,\n"+
		"Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he, or sits he?\n"+
		"Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?\n"+
		"O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!\n"+
		"Do bravely, horse! for wot'st thou whom thou movest?\n"+
		"The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm\n"+
		"And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,\n"+
		"Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'\n"+
		"For so he calls me: now I feed myself\n"+
		"With most delicious poison. Think on me,\n"+
		"That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,\n"+
		"And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,\n"+
		"When thou wast here above the ground, I was\n"+
		"A morsel for a monarch: and great Pompey\n"+
		"Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;\n"+
		"There would he anchor his aspect and die\n"+
		"With looking on his life.\n"+
		"Enter ALEXAS, from OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"ALEXAS\n"+
		"Sovereign of Egypt, hail!\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!\n"+
		"Yet, coming from him, that great medicine hath\n"+
		"With his tinct gilded thee.\n"+
		"How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?\n"+
		"ALEXAS\n"+
		"Last thing he did, dear queen,\n"+
		"He kiss'd,--the last of many doubled kisses,--\n"+
		"This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Mine ear must pluck it thence.\n"+
		"ALEXAS\n"+
		"'Good friend,' quoth he,\n"+
		"'Say, the firm Roman to great Egypt sends\n"+
		"This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,\n"+
		"To mend the petty present, I will piece\n"+
		"Her opulent throne with kingdoms; all the east,\n"+
		"Say thou, shall call her mistress.' So he nodded,\n"+
		"And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,\n"+
		"Who neigh'd so high, that what I would have spoke\n"+
		"Was beastly dumb'd by him.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"What, was he sad or merry?\n"+
		"ALEXAS\n"+
		"Like to the time o' the year between the extremes\n"+
		"Of hot and cold, he was nor sad nor merry.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"O well-divided disposition! Note him,\n"+
		"Note him good Charmian, 'tis the man; but note him:\n"+
		"He was not sad, for he would shine on those\n"+
		"That make their looks by his; he was not merry,\n"+
		"Which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay\n"+
		"In Egypt with his joy; but between both:\n"+
		"O heavenly mingle! Be'st thou sad or merry,\n"+
		"The violence of either thee becomes,\n"+
		"So does it no man else. Met'st thou my posts?\n"+
		"ALEXAS\n"+
		"Ay, madam, twenty several messengers:\n"+
		"Why do you send so thick?\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Who's born that day\n"+
		"When I forget to send to Antony,\n"+
		"Shall die a beggar. Ink and paper, Charmian.\n"+
		"Welcome, my good Alexas. Did I, Charmian,\n"+
		"Ever love Caesar so?\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"O that brave Caesar!\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Be choked with such another emphasis!\n"+
		"Say, the brave Antony.\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"The valiant Caesar!\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth,\n"+
		"If thou with Caesar paragon again\n"+
		"My man of men.\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"By your most gracious pardon,\n"+
		"I sing but after you.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"My salad days,\n"+
		"When I was green in judgment: cold in blood,\n"+
		"To say as I said then! But, come, away;\n"+
		"Get me ink and paper:\n"+
		"He shall have every day a several greeting,\n"+
		"Or I'll unpeople Egypt.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT II\n"+
		"SCENE I. Messina. POMPEY's house.\n"+
		"Enter POMPEY, MENECRATES, and MENAS, in warlike manner\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"If the great gods be just, they shall assist\n"+
		"The deeds of justest men.\n"+
		"MENECRATES\n"+
		"Know, worthy Pompey,\n"+
		"That what they do delay, they not deny.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"Whiles we are suitors to their throne, decays\n"+
		"The thing we sue for.\n"+
		"MENECRATES\n"+
		"We, ignorant of ourselves,\n"+
		"Beg often our own harms, which the wise powers\n"+
		"Deny us for our good; so find we profit\n"+
		"By losing of our prayers.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"I shall do well:\n"+
		"The people love me, and the sea is mine;\n"+
		"My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope\n"+
		"Says it will come to the full. Mark Antony\n"+
		"In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make\n"+
		"No wars without doors: Caesar gets money where\n"+
		"He loses hearts: Lepidus flatters both,\n"+
		"Of both is flatter'd; but he neither loves,\n"+
		"Nor either cares for him.\n"+
		"MENAS\n"+
		"Caesar and Lepidus\n"+
		"Are in the field: a mighty strength they carry.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"Where have you this? 'tis false.\n"+
		"MENAS\n"+
		"From Silvius, sir.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"He dreams: I know they are in Rome together,\n"+
		"Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love,\n"+
		"Salt Cleopatra, soften thy waned lip!\n"+
		"Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both!\n"+
		"Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts,\n"+
		"Keep his brain fuming; Epicurean cooks\n"+
		"Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite;\n"+
		"That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour\n"+
		"Even till a Lethe'd dulness!\n"+
		"Enter VARRIUS\n"+
		"How now, Varrius!\n"+
		"VARRIUS\n"+
		"This is most certain that I shall deliver:\n"+
		"Mark Antony is every hour in Rome\n"+
		"Expected: since he went from Egypt 'tis\n"+
		"A space for further travel.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"I could have given less matter\n"+
		"A better ear. Menas, I did not think\n"+
		"This amorous surfeiter would have donn'd his helm\n"+
		"For such a petty war: his soldiership\n"+
		"Is twice the other twain: but let us rear\n"+
		"The higher our opinion, that our stirring\n"+
		"Can from the lap of Egypt's widow pluck\n"+
		"The ne'er-lust-wearied Antony.\n"+
		"MENAS\n"+
		"I cannot hope\n"+
		"Caesar and Antony shall well greet together:\n"+
		"His wife that's dead did trespasses to Caesar;\n"+
		"His brother warr'd upon him; although, I think,\n"+
		"Not moved by Antony.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"I know not, Menas,\n"+
		"How lesser enmities may give way to greater.\n"+
		"Were't not that we stand up against them all,\n"+
		"'Twere pregnant they should square between\n"+
		"themselves;\n"+
		"For they have entertained cause enough\n"+
		"To draw their swords: but how the fear of us\n"+
		"May cement their divisions and bind up\n"+
		"The petty difference, we yet not know.\n"+
		"Be't as our gods will have't! It only stands\n"+
		"Our lives upon to use our strongest hands.\n"+
		"Come, Menas.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. Rome. The house of LEPIDUS.\n"+
		"Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and LEPIDUS\n"+
		"LEPIDUS\n"+
		"Good Enobarbus, 'tis a worthy deed,\n"+
		"And shall become you well, to entreat your captain\n"+
		"To soft and gentle speech.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"I shall entreat him\n"+
		"To answer like himself: if Caesar move him,\n"+
		"Let Antony look over Caesar's head\n"+
		"And speak as loud as Mars. By Jupiter,\n"+
		"Were I the wearer of Antonius' beard,\n"+
		"I would not shave't to-day.\n"+
		"LEPIDUS\n"+
		"'Tis not a time\n"+
		"For private stomaching.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"Every time\n"+
		"Serves for the matter that is then born in't.\n"+
		"LEPIDUS\n"+
		"But small to greater matters must give way.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"Not if the small come first.\n"+
		"LEPIDUS\n"+
		"Your speech is passion:\n"+
		"But, pray you, stir no embers up. Here comes\n"+
		"The noble Antony.\n"+
		"Enter MARK ANTONY and VENTIDIUS\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"And yonder, Caesar.\n"+
		"Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MECAENAS, and AGRIPPA\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"If we compose well here, to Parthia:\n"+
		"Hark, Ventidius.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"I do not know,\n"+
		"Mecaenas; ask Agrippa.\n"+
		"LEPIDUS\n"+
		"Noble friends,\n"+
		"That which combined us was most great, and let not\n"+
		"A leaner action rend us. What's amiss,\n"+
		"May it be gently heard: when we debate\n"+
		"Our trivial difference loud, we do commit\n"+
		"Murder in healing wounds: then, noble partners,\n"+
		"The rather, for I earnestly beseech,\n"+
		"Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms,\n"+
		"Nor curstness grow to the matter.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"'Tis spoken well.\n"+
		"Were we before our armies, and to fight.\n"+
		"I should do thus.\n"+
		"Flourish\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Welcome to Rome.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Thank you.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Sit.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Sit, sir.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Nay, then.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"I learn, you take things ill which are not so,\n"+
		"Or being, concern you not.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"I must be laugh'd at,\n"+
		"If, or for nothing or a little, I\n"+
		"Should say myself offended, and with you\n"+
		"Chiefly i' the world; more laugh'd at, that I should\n"+
		"Once name you derogately, when to sound your name\n"+
		"It not concern'd me.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"My being in Egypt, Caesar,\n"+
		"What was't to you?\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"No more than my residing here at Rome\n"+
		"Might be to you in Egypt: yet, if you there\n"+
		"Did practise on my state, your being in Egypt\n"+
		"Might be my question.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"How intend you, practised?\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"You may be pleased to catch at mine intent\n"+
		"By what did here befal me. Your wife and brother\n"+
		"Made wars upon me; and their contestation\n"+
		"Was theme for you, you were the word of war.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"You do mistake your business; my brother never\n"+
		"Did urge me in his act: I did inquire it;\n"+
		"And have my learning from some true reports,\n"+
		"That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather\n"+
		"Discredit my authority with yours;\n"+
		"And make the wars alike against my stomach,\n"+
		"Having alike your cause? Of this my letters\n"+
		"Before did satisfy you. If you'll patch a quarrel,\n"+
		"As matter whole you have not to make it with,\n"+
		"It must not be with this.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"You praise yourself\n"+
		"By laying defects of judgment to me; but\n"+
		"You patch'd up your excuses.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Not so, not so;\n"+
		"I know you could not lack, I am certain on't,\n"+
		"Very necessity of this thought, that I,\n"+
		"Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought,\n"+
		"Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars\n"+
		"Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,\n"+
		"I would you had her spirit in such another:\n"+
		"The third o' the world is yours; which with a snaffle\n"+
		"You may pace easy, but not such a wife.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"Would we had all such wives, that the men might go\n"+
		"to wars with the women!\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar\n"+
		"Made out of her impatience, which not wanted\n"+
		"Shrewdness of policy too, I grieving grant\n"+
		"Did you too much disquiet: for that you must\n"+
		"But say, I could not help it.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"I wrote to you\n"+
		"When rioting in Alexandria; you\n"+
		"Did pocket up my letters, and with taunts\n"+
		"Did gibe my missive out of audience.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Sir,\n"+
		"He fell upon me ere admitted: then\n"+
		"Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want\n"+
		"Of what I was i' the morning: but next day\n"+
		"I told him of myself; which was as much\n"+
		"As to have ask'd him pardon. Let this fellow\n"+
		"Be nothing of our strife; if we contend,\n"+
		"Out of our question wipe him.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"You have broken\n"+
		"The article of your oath; which you shall never\n"+
		"Have tongue to charge me with.\n"+
		"LEPIDUS\n"+
		"Soft, Caesar!\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"No,\n"+
		"Lepidus, let him speak:\n"+
		"The honour is sacred which he talks on now,\n"+
		"Supposing that I lack'd it. But, on, Caesar;\n"+
		"The article of my oath.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"To lend me arms and aid when I required them;\n"+
		"The which you both denied.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Neglected, rather;\n"+
		"And then when poison'd hours had bound me up\n"+
		"From mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may,\n"+
		"I'll play the penitent to you: but mine honesty\n"+
		"Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power\n"+
		"Work without it. Truth is, that Fulvia,\n"+
		"To have me out of Egypt, made wars here;\n"+
		"For which myself, the ignorant motive, do\n"+
		"So far ask pardon as befits mine honour\n"+
		"To stoop in such a case.\n"+
		"LEPIDUS\n"+
		"'Tis noble spoken.\n"+
		"MECAENAS\n"+
		"If it might please you, to enforce no further\n"+
		"The griefs between ye: to forget them quite\n"+
		"Were to remember that the present need\n"+
		"Speaks to atone you.\n"+
		"LEPIDUS\n"+
		"Worthily spoken, Mecaenas.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"Or, if you borrow one another's love for the\n"+
		"instant, you may, when you hear no more words of\n"+
		"Pompey, return it again: you shall have time to\n"+
		"wrangle in when you have nothing else to do.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Thou art a soldier only: speak no more.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"Go to, then; your considerate stone.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"I do not much dislike the matter, but\n"+
		"The manner of his speech; for't cannot be\n"+
		"We shall remain in friendship, our conditions\n"+
		"So differing in their acts. Yet if I knew\n"+
		"What hoop should hold us stanch, from edge to edge\n"+
		"O' the world I would pursue it.\n"+
		"AGRIPPA\n"+
		"Give me leave, Caesar,--\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Speak, Agrippa.\n"+
		"AGRIPPA\n"+
		"Thou hast a sister by the mother's side,\n"+
		"Admired Octavia: great Mark Antony\n"+
		"Is now a widower.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Say not so, Agrippa:\n"+
		"If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof\n"+
		"Were well deserved of rashness.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"I am not married, Caesar: let me hear\n"+
		"Agrippa further speak.\n"+
		"AGRIPPA\n"+
		"To hold you in perpetual amity,\n"+
		"To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts\n"+
		"With an unslipping knot, take Antony\n"+
		"Octavia to his wife; whose beauty claims\n"+
		"No worse a husband than the best of men;\n"+
		"Whose virtue and whose general graces speak\n"+
		"That which none else can utter. By this marriage,\n"+
		"All little jealousies, which now seem great,\n"+
		"And all great fears, which now import their dangers,\n"+
		"Would then be nothing: truths would be tales,\n"+
		"Where now half tales be truths: her love to both\n"+
		"Would, each to other and all loves to both,\n"+
		"Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;\n"+
		"For 'tis a studied, not a present thought,\n"+
		"By duty ruminated.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Will Caesar speak?\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Not till he hears how Antony is touch'd\n"+
		"With what is spoke already.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"What power is in Agrippa,\n"+
		"If I would say, 'Agrippa, be it so,'\n"+
		"To make this good?\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"The power of Caesar, and\n"+
		"His power unto Octavia.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"May I never\n"+
		"To this good purpose, that so fairly shows,\n"+
		"Dream of impediment! Let me have thy hand:\n"+
		"Further this act of grace: and from this hour\n"+
		"The heart of brothers govern in our loves\n"+
		"And sway our great designs!\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"There is my hand.\n"+
		"A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother\n"+
		"Did ever love so dearly: let her live\n"+
		"To join our kingdoms and our hearts; and never\n"+
		"Fly off our loves again!\n"+
		"LEPIDUS\n"+
		"Happily, amen!\n"+

		"At heel of that, defy him.\n"+
		"LEPIDUS\n"+
		"Time calls upon's:\n"+
		"Of us must Pompey presently be sought,\n"+

		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Where lies he?\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"About the mount Misenum.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"What is his strength by land?\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Great and increasing: but by sea\n"+
		"He is an absolute master.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"So is the fame.\n"+
		"Would we had spoke together! Haste we for it:\n"+
		"Yet, ere we put ourselves in arms, dispatch we\n"+

		"Welcome from Egypt, sir.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"Half the heart of Caesar, worthy Mecaenas! My\n"+
		"honourable friend, Agrippa!\n"+
		"AGRIPPA\n"+
		"Good Enobarbus!\n"+
		"MECAENAS\n"+
		"We have cause to be glad that matters are so well\n"+
		"digested. You stayed well by 't in Egypt.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance, and\n"+
		"made the night light with drinking.\n"+
		"MECAENAS\n"+
		"Eight wild-boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and\n"+
		"but twelve persons there; is this true?\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"This was but as a fly by an eagle: we had much more\n"+
		"monstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting.\n"+
		"MECAENAS\n"+
		"She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to\n"+
		"her.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"When she first met Mark Antony, she pursed up\n"+
		"his heart, upon the river of Cydnus.\n"+
		"AGRIPPA\n"+
		"There she appeared indeed; or my reporter devised\n"+
		"well for her.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"I will tell you.\n"+
		"The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,\n"+
		"Burn'd on the water: the poop was beaten gold;\n"+
		"Purple the sails, and so perfumed that\n"+
		"The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,\n"+
		"Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made\n"+
		"The water which they beat to follow faster,\n"+
		"As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,\n"+
		"It beggar'd all description: she did lie\n"+
		"In her pavilion--cloth-of-gold of tissue--\n"+
		"O'er-picturing that Venus where we see\n"+
		"The fancy outwork nature: on each side her\n"+
		"Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,\n"+
		"With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem\n"+
		"To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,\n"+
		"And what they undid did.\n"+
		"AGRIPPA\n"+
		"O, rare for Antony!\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,\n"+
		"So many mermaids, tended her i' the eyes,\n"+
		"And made their bends adornings: at the helm\n"+
		"A seeming mermaid steers: the silken tackle\n"+
		"Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands,\n"+
		"That yarely frame the office. From the barge\n"+
		"A strange invisible perfume hits the sense\n"+
		"Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast\n"+
		"Her people out upon her; and Antony,\n"+
		"Enthroned i' the market-place, did sit alone,\n"+
		"Whistling to the air; which, but for vacancy,\n"+
		"Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,\n"+
		"And made a gap in nature.\n"+
		"AGRIPPA\n"+
		"Rare Egyptian!\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,\n"+
		"Invited her to supper: she replied,\n"+
		"It should be better he became her guest;\n"+
		"Which she entreated: our courteous Antony,\n"+
		"Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak,\n"+
		"Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast,\n"+
		"And for his ordinary pays his heart\n"+
		"For what his eyes eat only.\n"+
		"AGRIPPA\n"+
		"Royal wench!\n"+
		"She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed:\n"+
		"He plough'd her, and she cropp'd.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"I saw her once\n"+
		"Hop forty paces through the public street;\n"+
		"And having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted,\n"+
		"That she did make defect perfection,\n"+
		"And, breathless, power breathe forth.\n"+
		"MECAENAS\n"+
		"Now Antony must leave her utterly.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"Never; he will not:\n"+
		"Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale\n"+
		"Her infinite variety: other women cloy\n"+
		"The appetites they feed: but she makes hungry\n"+
		"Where most she satisfies; for vilest things\n"+
		"Become themselves in her: that the holy priests\n"+
		"Bless her when she is riggish.\n"+
		"MECAENAS\n"+
		"If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle\n"+
		"The heart of Antony, Octavia is\n"+
		"A blessed lottery to him.\n"+
		"AGRIPPA\n"+
		"Let us go.\n"+

		"Read not my blemishes in the world's report:\n"+

		"Good night.\n"+

		"Now, sirrah; you do wish yourself in Egypt?\n"+
		"Soothsayer\n"+
		"Would I had never come from thence, nor you Thither!\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"If you can, your reason?\n"+
		"Soothsayer\n"+
		"I see it in\n"+
		"My motion, have it not in my tongue: but yet\n"+
		"Hie you to Egypt again.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Say to me,\n"+
		"Whose fortunes shall rise higher, Caesar's or mine?\n"+
		"Soothsayer\n"+
		"Caesar's.\n"+
		"Therefore, O Antony, stay not by his side:\n"+
		"Thy demon, that's thy spirit which keeps thee, is\n"+
		"Noble, courageous high, unmatchable,\n"+
		"Where Caesar's is not; but, near him, thy angel\n"+
		"Becomes a fear, as being o'erpower'd: therefore\n"+
		"Make space enough between you.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Speak this no more.\n"+
		"Soothsayer\n"+
		"To none but thee; no more, but when to thee.\n"+
		"If thou dost play with him at any game,\n"+
		"Thou art sure to lose; and, of that natural luck,\n"+
		"He beats thee 'gainst the odds: thy lustre thickens,\n"+
		"When he shines by: I say again, thy spirit\n"+
		"Is all afraid to govern thee near him;\n"+
		"But, he away, 'tis noble.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Get thee gone:\n"+
		"Say to Ventidius I would speak with him:\n"+
		"Exit Soothsayer\n"+
		"He shall to Parthia. Be it art or hap,\n"+
		"He hath spoken true: the very dice obey him;\n"+
		"And in our sports my better cunning faints\n"+
		"Under his chance: if we draw lots, he speeds;\n"+
		"His cocks do win the battle still of mine,\n"+
		"When it is all to nought; and his quails ever\n"+
		"Beat mine, inhoop'd, at odds. I will to Egypt:\n"+
		"And though I make this marriage for my peace,\n"+
		"I' the east my pleasure lies.\n"+
		"Enter VENTIDIUS\n"+
		"O, come, Ventidius,\n"+
		"You must to Parthia: your commission's ready;\n"+

		"Trouble yourselves no further: pray you, hasten\n"+
		"Your generals after.\n"+
		"AGRIPPA\n"+
		"Sir, Mark Antony\n"+
		"Will e'en but kiss Octavia, and we'll follow.\n"+
		"LEPIDUS\n"+
		"Till I shall see you in your soldier's dress,\n"+
		"Which will become you both, farewell.\n"+
		"MECAENAS\n"+
		"We shall,\n"+
		"As I conceive the journey, be at the Mount\n"+
		"Before you, Lepidus.\n"+
		"LEPIDUS\n"+
		"Your way is shorter;\n"+
		"My purposes do draw me much about:\n"+
		"You'll win two days upon me.\n"+
		"MECAENAS\n"+
		"AGRIPPA\n"+
		"Sir, good success!\n"+
		"LEPIDUS\n"+
		"Farewell.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE V. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.\n"+
		"Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Give me some music; music, moody food\n"+
		"Of us that trade in love.\n"+
		"Attendants\n"+
		"The music, ho!\n"+
		"Enter MARDIAN\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Let it alone; let's to billiards: come, Charmian.\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"My arm is sore; best play with Mardian.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"As well a woman with an eunuch play'd\n"+
		"As with a woman. Come, you'll play with me, sir?\n"+
		"MARDIAN\n"+
		"As well as I can, madam.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"And when good will is show'd, though't come\n"+
		"too short,\n"+
		"The actor may plead pardon. I'll none now:\n"+
		"Give me mine angle; we'll to the river: there,\n"+
		"My music playing far off, I will betray\n"+
		"Tawny-finn'd fishes; my bended hook shall pierce\n"+
		"Their slimy jaws; and, as I draw them up,\n"+
		"I'll think them every one an Antony,\n"+
		"And say 'Ah, ha! you're caught.'\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"'Twas merry when\n"+
		"You wager'd on your angling; when your diver\n"+
		"Did hang a salt-fish on his hook, which he\n"+
		"With fervency drew up.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"That time,--O times!--\n"+
		"I laugh'd him out of patience; and that night\n"+
		"I laugh'd him into patience; and next morn,\n"+
		"Ere the ninth hour, I drunk him to his bed;\n"+
		"Then put my tires and mantles on him, whilst\n"+
		"I wore his sword Philippan.\n"+
		"Enter a Messenger\n"+
		"O, from Italy\n"+
		"Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears,\n"+
		"That long time have been barren.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Madam, madam,--\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Antonius dead!--If thou say so, villain,\n"+
		"Thou kill'st thy mistress: but well and free,\n"+
		"If thou so yield him, there is gold, and here\n"+
		"My bluest veins to kiss; a hand that kings\n"+
		"Have lipp'd, and trembled kissing.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"First, madam, he is well.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Why, there's more gold.\n"+
		"But, sirrah, mark, we use\n"+
		"To say the dead are well: bring it to that,\n"+
		"The gold I give thee will I melt and pour\n"+
		"Down thy ill-uttering throat.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Good madam, hear me.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Well, go to, I will;\n"+
		"But there's no goodness in thy face: if Antony\n"+
		"Be free and healthful,--so tart a favour\n"+
		"To trumpet such good tidings! If not well,\n"+
		"Thou shouldst come like a Fury crown'd with snakes,\n"+
		"Not like a formal man.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Will't please you hear me?\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st:\n"+
		"Yet if thou say Antony lives, is well,\n"+
		"Or friends with Caesar, or not captive to him,\n"+
		"I'll set thee in a shower of gold, and hail\n"+
		"Rich pearls upon thee.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Madam, he's well.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Well said.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"And friends with Caesar.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Thou'rt an honest man.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Caesar and he are greater friends than ever.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Make thee a fortune from me.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"But yet, madam,--\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"I do not like 'But yet,' it does allay\n"+
		"The good precedence; fie upon 'But yet'!\n"+
		"'But yet' is as a gaoler to bring forth\n"+
		"Some monstrous malefactor. Prithee, friend,\n"+
		"Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear,\n"+
		"The good and bad together: he's friends with Caesar:\n"+
		"In state of health thou say'st; and thou say'st free.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Free, madam! no; I made no such report:\n"+
		"He's bound unto Octavia.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"For what good turn?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"For the best turn i' the bed.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"I am pale, Charmian.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Madam, he's married to Octavia.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"The most infectious pestilence upon thee!\n"+
		"Strikes him down\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Good madam, patience.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"What say you? Hence,\n"+
		"Strikes him again\n"+
		"Horrible villain! or I'll spurn thine eyes\n"+
		"Like balls before me; I'll unhair thy head:\n"+
		"She hales him up and down\n"+
		"Thou shalt be whipp'd with wire, and stew'd in brine,\n"+
		"Smarting in lingering pickle.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Gracious madam,\n"+
		"I that do bring the news made not the match.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Say 'tis not so, a province I will give thee,\n"+
		"And make thy fortunes proud: the blow thou hadst\n"+
		"Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage;\n"+
		"And I will boot thee with what gift beside\n"+
		"Thy modesty can beg.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"He's married, madam.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Rogue, thou hast lived too long.\n"+
		"Draws a knife\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Nay, then I'll run.\n"+
		"What mean you, madam? I have made no fault.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"Good madam, keep yourself within yourself:\n"+
		"The man is innocent.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Some innocents 'scape not the thunderbolt.\n"+
		"Melt Egypt into Nile! and kindly creatures\n"+
		"Turn all to serpents! Call the slave again:\n"+
		"Though I am mad, I will not bite him: call.\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"He is afeard to come.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"I will not hurt him.\n"+
		"Exit CHARMIAN\n"+
		"These hands do lack nobility, that they strike\n"+
		"A meaner than myself; since I myself\n"+
		"Have given myself the cause.\n"+
		"Re-enter CHARMIAN and Messenger\n"+
		"Come hither, sir.\n"+
		"Though it be honest, it is never good\n"+
		"To bring bad news: give to a gracious message.\n"+
		"An host of tongues; but let ill tidings tell\n"+
		"Themselves when they be felt.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"I have done my duty.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Is he married?\n"+
		"I cannot hate thee worser than I do,\n"+
		"If thou again say 'Yes.'\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"He's married, madam.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"The gods confound thee! dost thou hold there still?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Should I lie, madam?\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"O, I would thou didst,\n"+
		"So half my Egypt were submerged and made\n"+
		"A cistern for scaled snakes! Go, get thee hence:\n"+
		"Hadst thou Narcissus in thy face, to me\n"+
		"Thou wouldst appear most ugly. He is married?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"I crave your highness' pardon.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"He is married?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Take no offence that I would not offend you:\n"+
		"To punish me for what you make me do.\n"+
		"Seems much unequal: he's married to Octavia.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"O, that his fault should make a knave of thee,\n"+
		"That art not what thou'rt sure of! Get thee hence:\n"+
		"The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome\n"+
		"Are all too dear for me: lie they upon thy hand,\n"+
		"And be undone by 'em!\n"+
		"Exit Messenger\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"Good your highness, patience.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"In praising Antony, I have dispraised Caesar.\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"Many times, madam.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"I am paid for't now.\n"+
		"Lead me from hence:\n"+
		"I faint: O Iras, Charmian! 'tis no matter.\n"+
		"Go to the fellow, good Alexas; bid him\n"+
		"Report the feature of Octavia, her years,\n"+
		"Her inclination, let him not leave out\n"+
		"The colour of her hair: bring me word quickly.\n"+
		"Exit ALEXAS\n"+
		"Let him for ever go:--let him not--Charmian,\n"+
		"Though he be painted one way like a Gorgon,\n"+
		"The other way's a Mars. Bid you Alexas\n"+
		"To MARDIAN\n"+
		"Bring me word how tall she is. Pity me, Charmian,\n"+
		"But do not speak to me. Lead me to my chamber.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE VI. Near Misenum.\n"+
		"Flourish. Enter POMPEY and MENAS at one door, with drum and trumpet: at another, OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY, LEPIDUS, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, MECAENAS, with Soldiers marching\n"+

		"Your hostages I have, so have you mine;\n"+

		"Which, if thou hast consider'd, let us know\n"+
		"If 'twill tie up thy discontented sword,\n"+

		"The senators alone of this great world,\n"+
		"Chief factors for the gods, I do not know\n"+
		"Wherefore my father should revengers want,\n"+
		"Having a son and friends; since Julius Caesar,\n"+
		"Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted,\n"+
		"There saw you labouring for him. What was't\n"+
		"That moved pale Cassius to conspire; and what\n"+

		"With the arm'd rest, courtiers and beauteous freedom,\n"+
		"To drench the Capitol; but that they would\n"+
		"Have one man but a man? And that is it\n"+
		"Hath made me rig my navy; at whose burthen\n"+
		"The anger'd ocean foams; with which I meant\n"+
		"To scourge the ingratitude that despiteful Rome\n"+
		"Cast on my noble father.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Take your time.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails;\n"+
		"We'll speak with thee at sea: at land, thou know'st\n"+
		"How much we do o'er-count thee.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"At land, indeed,\n"+
		"Thou dost o'er-count me of my father's house:\n"+

		"Which do not be entreated to, but weigh\n"+
		"What it is worth embraced.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"And what may follow,\n"+
		"To try a larger fortune.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"You have made me offer\n"+

		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"You have heard much.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"I have fair meanings, sir.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"And fair words to them.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"Then so much have I heard:\n"+
		"And I have heard, Apollodorus carried--\n"+

		"No more of that: he did so.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"What, I pray you?\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"I know thee now: how farest thou, soldier?\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"Well;\n"+
		"And well am like to do; for, I perceive,\n"+
		"Four feasts are toward.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"Let me shake thy hand;\n"+
		"I never hated thee: I have seen thee fight,\n"+
		"When I have envied thy behavior.\n"+

		"As I have said you did.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"Enjoy thy plainness,\n"+
		"It nothing ill becomes thee.\n"+

		"Will you lead, lords?\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+

		"Come.\n"+

		"MENAS\n"+
		"[Aside] Thy father, Pompey, would ne'er have\n"+
		"made this treaty.--You and I have known, sir.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"At sea, I think.\n"+
		"MENAS\n"+
		"We have, sir.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"You have done well by water.\n"+
		"MENAS\n"+
		"And you by land.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"I will praise any man that will praise me; though it\n"+
		"cannot be denied what I have done by land.\n"+
		"MENAS\n"+
		"Nor what I have done by water.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"Yes, something you can deny for your own\n"+
		"safety: you have been a great thief by sea.\n"+
		"MENAS\n"+
		"And you by land.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"There I deny my land service. But give me your\n"+
		"hand, Menas: if our eyes had authority, here they\n"+
		"might take two thieves kissing.\n"+
		"MENAS\n"+
		"All men's faces are true, whatsome'er their hands are.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"But there is never a fair woman has a true face.\n"+
		"MENAS\n"+
		"No slander; they steal hearts.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"We came hither to fight with you.\n"+
		"MENAS\n"+
		"For my part, I am sorry it is turned to a drinking.\n"+
		"Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"If he do, sure, he cannot weep't back again.\n"+
		"MENAS\n"+
		"You've said, sir. We looked not for Mark Antony\n"+
		"here: pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"Caesar's sister is called Octavia.\n"+
		"MENAS\n"+
		"True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.\n"+
		"MENAS\n"+
		"Pray ye, sir?\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"'Tis true.\n"+
		"MENAS\n"+
		"Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would\n"+
		"not prophesy so.\n"+
		"MENAS\n"+
		"I think the policy of that purpose made more in the\n"+
		"marriage than the love of the parties.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"I think so too. But you shall find, the band that\n"+
		"seems to tie their friendship together will be the\n"+
		"very strangler of their amity: Octavia is of a\n"+
		"holy, cold, and still conversation.\n"+
		"MENAS\n"+
		"Who would not have his wife so?\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony.\n"+
		"He will to his Egyptian dish again: then shall the\n"+
		"sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar; and, as\n"+
		"I said before, that which is the strength of their\n"+
		"amity shall prove the immediate author of their\n"+
		"variance. Antony will use his affection where it is:\n"+
		"he married but his occasion here.\n"+
		"MENAS\n"+
		"And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard?\n"+
		"I have a health for you.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"I shall take it, sir: we have used our throats in Egypt.\n"+
		"MENAS\n"+
		"Come, let's away.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE VII. On board POMPEY's galley, off Misenum.\n"+
		"Music plays. Enter two or three Servants with a banquet\n"+
		"First Servant\n"+
		"Here they'll be, man. Some o' their plants are\n"+
		"ill-rooted already: the least wind i' the world\n"+
		"will blow them down.\n"+
		"Second Servant\n"+
		"Lepidus is high-coloured.\n"+
		"First Servant\n"+
		"They have made him drink alms-drink.\n"+
		"Second Servant\n"+
		"As they pinch one another by the disposition, he\n"+
		"cries out 'No more;' reconciles them to his\n"+
		"entreaty, and himself to the drink.\n"+
		"First Servant\n"+
		"But it raises the greater war between him and\n"+
		"his discretion.\n"+
		"Second Servant\n"+
		"Why, this is to have a name in great men's\n"+
		"fellowship: I had as lief have a reed that will do\n"+
		"me no service as a partisan I could not heave.\n"+
		"First Servant\n"+
		"To be called into a huge sphere, and not to be seen\n"+
		"to move in't, are the holes where eyes should be,\n"+
		"which pitifully disaster the cheeks.\n"+
		"A sennet sounded. Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY, LEPIDUS, POMPEY, AGRIPPA, MECAENAS, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, MENAS, with other captains\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"[To OCTAVIUS CAESAR] Thus do they, sir: they take\n"+
		"the flow o' the Nile\n"+
		"By certain scales i' the pyramid; they know,\n"+
		"By the height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearth\n"+
		"Or foison follow: the higher Nilus swells,\n"+
		"The more it promises: as it ebbs, the seedsman\n"+
		"Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain,\n"+
		"And shortly comes to harvest.\n"+
		"LEPIDUS\n"+
		"You've strange serpents there.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Ay, Lepidus.\n"+
		"LEPIDUS\n"+
		"Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the\n"+
		"operation of your sun: so is your crocodile.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"They are so.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"Sit,--and some wine! A health to Lepidus!\n"+
		"LEPIDUS\n"+
		"I am not so well as I should be, but I'll ne'er out.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"Not till you have slept; I fear me you'll be in till then.\n"+
		"LEPIDUS\n"+
		"Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies'\n"+
		"pyramises are very goodly things; without\n"+
		"contradiction, I have heard that.\n"+
		"MENAS\n"+
		"[Aside to POMPEY] Pompey, a word.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"[Aside to MENAS] Say in mine ear:\n"+
		"what is't?\n"+
		"MENAS\n"+
		"[Aside to POMPEY] Forsake thy seat, I do beseech\n"+
		"thee, captain,\n"+
		"And hear me speak a word.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"[Aside to MENAS] Forbear me till anon.\n"+
		"This wine for Lepidus!\n"+
		"LEPIDUS\n"+
		"What manner o' thing is your crocodile?\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"It is shaped, sir, like itself; and it is as broad\n"+
		"as it hath breadth: it is just so high as it is,\n"+
		"and moves with its own organs: it lives by that\n"+
		"which nourisheth it; and the elements once out of\n"+
		"it, it transmigrates.\n"+
		"LEPIDUS\n"+
		"What colour is it of?\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Of it own colour too.\n"+
		"LEPIDUS\n"+
		"'Tis a strange serpent.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"'Tis so. And the tears of it are wet.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Will this description satisfy him?\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"With the health that Pompey gives him, else he is a\n"+
		"very epicure.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"[Aside to MENAS] Go hang, sir, hang! Tell me of\n"+
		"that? away!\n"+
		"Do as I bid you. Where's this cup I call'd for?\n"+
		"MENAS\n"+
		"[Aside to POMPEY] If for the sake of merit thou\n"+
		"wilt hear me,\n"+
		"Rise from thy stool.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"[Aside to MENAS] I think thou'rt mad.\n"+
		"The matter?\n"+
		"Rises, and walks aside\n"+
		"MENAS\n"+
		"I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"Thou hast served me with much faith. What's else to say?\n"+
		"Be jolly, lords.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"These quick-sands, Lepidus,\n"+
		"Keep off them, for you sink.\n"+
		"MENAS\n"+
		"Wilt thou be lord of all the world?\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"What say'st thou?\n"+
		"MENAS\n"+
		"Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"How should that be?\n"+
		"MENAS\n"+
		"But entertain it,\n"+
		"And, though thou think me poor, I am the man\n"+
		"Will give thee all the world.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"Hast thou drunk well?\n"+
		"MENAS\n"+
		"Now, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.\n"+
		"Thou art, if thou darest be, the earthly Jove:\n"+
		"Whate'er the ocean pales, or sky inclips,\n"+
		"Is thine, if thou wilt ha't.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"Show me which way.\n"+
		"MENAS\n"+
		"These three world-sharers, these competitors,\n"+
		"Are in thy vessel: let me cut the cable;\n"+
		"And, when we are put off, fall to their throats:\n"+
		"All there is thine.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"Ah, this thou shouldst have done,\n"+
		"And not have spoke on't! In me 'tis villany;\n"+
		"In thee't had been good service. Thou must know,\n"+
		"'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour;\n"+
		"Mine honour, it. Repent that e'er thy tongue\n"+
		"Hath so betray'd thine act: being done unknown,\n"+
		"I should have found it afterwards well done;\n"+
		"But must condemn it now. Desist, and drink.\n"+
		"MENAS\n"+
		"[Aside] For this,\n"+
		"I'll never follow thy pall'd fortunes more.\n"+
		"Who seeks, and will not take when once 'tis offer'd,\n"+
		"Shall never find it more.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"This health to Lepidus!\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Bear him ashore. I'll pledge it for him, Pompey.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"Here's to thee, Menas!\n"+
		"MENAS\n"+
		"Enobarbus, welcome!\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"Fill till the cup be hid.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"There's a strong fellow, Menas.\n"+
		"Pointing to the Attendant who carries off LEPIDUS\n"+
		"MENAS\n"+
		"Why?\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"A' bears the third part of the world, man; see'st\n"+
		"not?\n"+
		"MENAS\n"+
		"The third part, then, is drunk: would it were all,\n"+
		"That it might go on wheels!\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"Drink thou; increase the reels.\n"+
		"MENAS\n"+
		"Come.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"This is not yet an Alexandrian feast.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"It ripens towards it. Strike the vessels, ho?\n"+
		"Here is to Caesar!\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"I could well forbear't.\n"+
		"It's monstrous labour, when I wash my brain,\n"+
		"And it grows fouler.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Be a child o' the time.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Possess it, I'll make answer:\n"+
		"But I had rather fast from all four days\n"+
		"Than drink so much in one.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"Ha, my brave emperor!\n"+
		"To MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Shall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals,\n"+
		"And celebrate our drink?\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"Let's ha't, good soldier.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Come, let's all take hands,\n"+
		"Till that the conquering wine hath steep'd our sense\n"+
		"In soft and delicate Lethe.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"All take hands.\n"+
		"Make battery to our ears with the loud music:\n"+
		"The while I'll place you: then the boy shall sing;\n"+
		"The holding every man shall bear as loud\n"+
		"As his strong sides can volley.\n"+
		"Music plays. DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS places them hand in hand\n"+
		"THE SONG.\n"+
		"Come, thou monarch of the vine,\n"+
		"Plumpy Bacchus with pink eyne!\n"+
		"In thy fats our cares be drown'd,\n"+
		"With thy grapes our hairs be crown'd:\n"+

		"Cup us, till the world go round!\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"What would you more? Pompey, good night. Good brother,\n"+
		"Let me request you off: our graver business\n"+
		"Frowns at this levity. Gentle lords, let's part;\n"+
		"You see we have burnt our cheeks: strong Enobarb\n"+
		"Is weaker than the wine; and mine own tongue\n"+
		"Splits what it speaks: the wild disguise hath almost\n"+
		"Antick'd us all. What needs more words? Good night.\n"+
		"Good Antony, your hand.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"I'll try you on the shore.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"And shall, sir; give's your hand.\n"+

		"Take heed you fall not.\n"+
		"Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and MENAS\n"+
		"Menas, I'll not on shore.\n"+
		"MENAS\n"+
		"No, to my cabin.\n"+
		"These drums! these trumpets, flutes! what!\n"+
		"Let Neptune hear we bid a loud farewell\n"+
		"To these great fellows: sound and be hang'd, sound out!\n"+
		"Sound a flourish, with drums\n"+

		"Ho! Noble captain, come.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT III\n"+
		"SCENE I. A plain in Syria.\n"+
		"Enter VENTIDIUS as it were in triumph, with SILIUS, and other Romans, Officers, and Soldiers; the dead body of PACORUS borne before him\n"+
		"VENTIDIUS\n"+
		"Now, darting Parthia, art thou struck; and now\n"+
		"Pleased fortune does of Marcus Crassus' death\n"+
		"Make me revenger. Bear the king's son's body\n"+
		"Before our army. Thy Pacorus, Orodes,\n"+
		"Pays this for Marcus Crassus.\n"+
		"SILIUS\n"+
		"Noble Ventidius,\n"+
		"Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm,\n"+
		"The fugitive Parthians follow; spur through Media,\n"+
		"Mesopotamia, and the shelters whither\n"+
		"The routed fly: so thy grand captain Antony\n"+
		"Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and\n"+
		"Put garlands on thy head.\n"+
		"VENTIDIUS\n"+
		"O Silius, Silius,\n"+
		"I have done enough; a lower place, note well,\n"+
		"May make too great an act: for learn this, Silius;\n"+
		"Better to leave undone, than by our deed\n"+
		"Acquire too high a fame when him we serve's away.\n"+
		"Caesar and Antony have ever won\n"+
		"More in their officer than person: Sossius,\n"+
		"One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant,\n"+
		"For quick accumulation of renown,\n"+
		"Which he achieved by the minute, lost his favour.\n"+
		"Who does i' the wars more than his captain can\n"+
		"Becomes his captain's captain: and ambition,\n"+
		"The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss,\n"+
		"Than gain which darkens him.\n"+
		"I could do more to do Antonius good,\n"+
		"But 'twould offend him; and in his offence\n"+
		"Should my performance perish.\n"+
		"SILIUS\n"+
		"Thou hast, Ventidius,\n"+
		"that\n"+
		"Without the which a soldier, and his sword,\n"+
		"Grants scarce distinction. Thou wilt write to Antony!\n"+
		"VENTIDIUS\n"+
		"I'll humbly signify what in his name,\n"+
		"That magical word of war, we have effected;\n"+
		"How, with his banners and his well-paid ranks,\n"+
		"The ne'er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia\n"+
		"We have jaded out o' the field.\n"+
		"SILIUS\n"+
		"Where is he now?\n"+
		"VENTIDIUS\n"+
		"He purposeth to Athens: whither, with what haste\n"+
		"The weight we must convey with's will permit,\n"+
		"We shall appear before him. On there; pass along!\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. Rome. An ante-chamber in OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.\n"+
		"Enter AGRIPPA at one door, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS at another\n"+
		"AGRIPPA\n"+
		"What, are the brothers parted?\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"They have dispatch'd with Pompey, he is gone;\n"+
		"The other three are sealing. Octavia weeps\n"+
		"To part from Rome; Caesar is sad; and Lepidus,\n"+
		"Since Pompey's feast, as Menas says, is troubled\n"+
		"With the green sickness.\n"+
		"AGRIPPA\n"+
		"'Tis a noble Lepidus.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"A very fine one: O, how he loves Caesar!\n"+
		"AGRIPPA\n"+
		"Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony!\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"Caesar? Why, he's the Jupiter of men.\n"+
		"AGRIPPA\n"+
		"What's Antony? The god of Jupiter.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"Spake you of Caesar? How! the non-pareil!\n"+
		"AGRIPPA\n"+
		"O Antony! O thou Arabian bird!\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"Would you praise Caesar, say 'Caesar:' go no further.\n"+
		"AGRIPPA\n"+
		"Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"But he loves Caesar best; yet he loves Antony:\n"+
		"Ho! hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards,\n"+
		"poets, cannot\n"+
		"Think, speak, cast, write, sing, number, ho!\n"+
		"His love to Antony. But as for Caesar,\n"+
		"Kneel down, kneel down, and wonder.\n"+
		"AGRIPPA\n"+
		"Both he loves.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"They are his shards, and he their beetle.\n"+
		"Trumpets within\n"+
		"So;\n"+
		"This is to horse. Adieu, noble Agrippa.\n"+
		"AGRIPPA\n"+
		"Good fortune, worthy soldier; and farewell.\n"+
		"Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY, LEPIDUS, and OCTAVIA\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"No further, sir.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"You take from me a great part of myself;\n"+
		"Use me well in 't. Sister, prove such a wife\n"+
		"As my thoughts make thee, and as my farthest band\n"+
		"Shall pass on thy approof. Most noble Antony,\n"+
		"Let not the piece of virtue, which is set\n"+
		"Betwixt us as the cement of our love,\n"+
		"To keep it builded, be the ram to batter\n"+
		"The fortress of it; for better might we\n"+
		"Have loved without this mean, if on both parts\n"+
		"This be not cherish'd.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Make me not offended\n"+
		"In your distrust.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"I have said.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"You shall not find,\n"+
		"Though you be therein curious, the least cause\n"+
		"For what you seem to fear: so, the gods keep you,\n"+
		"And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends!\n"+
		"We will here part.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Farewell, my dearest sister, fare thee well:\n"+
		"The elements be kind to thee, and make\n"+
		"Thy spirits all of comfort! fare thee well.\n"+
		"OCTAVIA\n"+
		"My noble brother!\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"The April 's in her eyes: it is love's spring,\n"+
		"And these the showers to bring it on. Be cheerful.\n"+
		"OCTAVIA\n"+
		"Sir, look well to my husband's house; and--\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"What, Octavia?\n"+
		"OCTAVIA\n"+
		"I'll tell you in your ear.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Her tongue will not obey her heart, nor can\n"+
		"Her heart inform her tongue,--the swan's\n"+
		"down-feather,\n"+
		"That stands upon the swell at full of tide,\n"+
		"And neither way inclines.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"[Aside to AGRIPPA] Will Caesar weep?\n"+
		"AGRIPPA\n"+
		"[Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS] He has a cloud in 's face.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"[Aside to AGRIPPA] He were the worse for that,\n"+
		"were he a horse;\n"+
		"So is he, being a man.\n"+
		"AGRIPPA\n"+
		"[Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS] Why, Enobarbus,\n"+
		"When Antony found Julius Caesar dead,\n"+
		"He cried almost to roaring; and he wept\n"+
		"When at Philippi he found Brutus slain.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"[Aside to AGRIPPA] That year, indeed, he was\n"+
		"troubled with a rheum;\n"+
		"What willingly he did confound he wail'd,\n"+
		"Believe't, till I wept too.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"No, sweet Octavia,\n"+
		"You shall hear from me still; the time shall not\n"+
		"Out-go my thinking on you.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Come, sir, come;\n"+
		"I'll wrestle with you in my strength of love:\n"+
		"Look, here I have you; thus I let you go,\n"+
		"And give you to the gods.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Adieu; be happy!\n"+
		"LEPIDUS\n"+
		"Let all the number of the stars give light\n"+
		"To thy fair way!\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Farewell, fa rewell!\n"+
		"Kisses OCTAVIA\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Farewell!\n"+
		"Trumpets sound. Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.\n"+
		"Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Where is the fellow?\n"+
		"ALEXAS\n"+
		"Half afeard to come.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Go to, go to.\n"+
		"Enter the Messenger as before\n"+
		"Come hither, sir.\n"+
		"ALEXAS\n"+
		"Good majesty,\n"+
		"Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you\n"+
		"But when you are well pleased.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"That Herod's head\n"+
		"I'll have: but how, when Antony is gone\n"+
		"Through whom I might command it? Come thou near.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Most gracious majesty,--\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Didst thou behold Octavia?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Ay, dread queen.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Where?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Madam, in Rome;\n"+
		"I look'd her in the face, and saw her led\n"+
		"Between her brother and Mark Antony.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Is she as tall as me?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"She is not, madam.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Didst hear her speak? is she shrill-tongued or low?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Madam, I heard her speak; she is low-voiced.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"That's not so good: he cannot like her long.\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"Like her! O Isis! 'tis impossible.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"I think so, Charmian: dull of tongue, and dwarfish!\n"+
		"What majesty is in her gait? Remember,\n"+
		"If e'er thou look'dst on majesty.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"She creeps:\n"+
		"Her motion and her station are as one;\n"+
		"She shows a body rather than a life,\n"+
		"A statue than a breather.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Is this certain?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Or I have no observance.\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"Three in Egypt\n"+
		"Cannot make better note.\n"+

		"He's very knowing;\n"+
		"I do perceive't: there's nothing in her yet:\n"+
		"The fellow has good judgment.\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"Excellent.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Guess at her years, I prithee.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Madam,\n"+
		"She was a widow,--\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Widow! Charmian, hark.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"And I do think she's thirty.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Bear'st thou her face in mind? is't long or round?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Round even to faultiness.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so.\n"+
		"Her hair, what colour?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Brown, madam: and her forehead\n"+
		"As low as she would wish it.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"There's gold for thee.\n"+
		"Thou must not take my former sharpness ill:\n"+
		"I will employ thee back again; I find thee\n"+
		"Most fit for business: go make thee ready;\n"+
		"Our letters are prepared.\n"+
		"Exit Messenger\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"A proper man.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Indeed, he is so: I repent me much\n"+
		"That so I harried him. Why, methinks, by him,\n"+
		"This creature's no such thing.\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"Nothing, madam.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"The man hath seen some majesty, and should know.\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"Hath he seen majesty? Isis else defend,\n"+
		"And serving you so long!\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"I have one thing more to ask him yet, good Charmian:\n"+
		"But 'tis no matter; thou shalt bring him to me\n"+
		"Where I will write. All may be well enough.\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"I warrant you, madam.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV. Athens. A room in MARK ANTONY's house.\n"+
		"Enter MARK ANTONY and OCTAVIA\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Nay, nay, Octavia, not only that,--\n"+
		"That were excusable, that, and thousands more\n"+
		"Of semblable import,--but he hath waged\n"+
		"New wars 'gainst Pompey; made his will, and read it\n"+
		"To public ear:\n"+
		"Spoke scantly of me: when perforce he could not\n"+
		"But pay me terms of honour, cold and sickly\n"+
		"He vented them; most narrow measure lent me:\n"+
		"When the best hint was given him, he not took't,\n"+
		"Or did it from his teeth.\n"+
		"OCTAVIA\n"+
		"O my good lord,\n"+
		"Believe not all; or, if you must believe,\n"+
		"Stomach not all. A more unhappy lady,\n"+
		"If this division chance, ne'er stood between,\n"+
		"Praying for both parts:\n"+
		"The good gods me presently,\n"+
		"When I shall pray, 'O bless my lord and husband!'\n"+
		"Undo that prayer, by crying out as loud,\n"+
		"'O, bless my brother!' Husband win, win brother,\n"+
		"Prays, and destroys the prayer; no midway\n"+
		"'Twixt these extremes at all.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Gentle Octavia,\n"+
		"Let your best love draw to that point, which seeks\n"+
		"Best to preserve it: if I lose mine honour,\n"+
		"I lose myself: better I were not yours\n"+
		"Than yours so branchless. But, as you requested,\n"+
		"Yourself shall go between 's: the mean time, lady,\n"+
		"I'll raise the preparation of a war\n"+
		"Shall stain your brother: make your soonest haste;\n"+
		"So your desires are yours.\n"+
		"OCTAVIA\n"+
		"Thanks to my lord.\n"+
		"The Jove of power make me most weak, most weak,\n"+
		"Your reconciler! Wars 'twixt you twain would be\n"+
		"As if the world should cleave, and that slain men\n"+
		"Should solder up the rift.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"When it appears to you where this begins,\n"+
		"Turn your displeasure that way: for our faults\n"+
		"Can never be so equal, that your love\n"+
		"Can equally move with them. Provide your going;\n"+
		"Choose your own company, and command what cost\n"+
		"Your heart has mind to.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE V. The same. Another room.\n"+
		"Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and EROS, meeting\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"How now, friend Eros!\n"+
		"EROS\n"+
		"There's strange news come, sir.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"What, man?\n"+
		"EROS\n"+
		"Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"This is old: what is the success?\n"+
		"EROS\n"+
		"Caesar, having made use of him in the wars 'gainst\n"+
		"Pompey, presently denied him rivality; would not let\n"+
		"him partake in the glory of the action: and not\n"+
		"resting here, accuses him of letters he had formerly\n"+
		"wrote to Pompey; upon his own appeal, seizes him: so\n"+
		"the poor third is up, till death enlarge his confine.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"Then, world, thou hast a pair of chaps, no more;\n"+
		"And throw between them all the food thou hast,\n"+
		"They'll grind the one the other. Where's Antony?\n"+
		"EROS\n"+
		"He's walking in the garden--thus; and spurns\n"+
		"The rush that lies before him; cries, 'Fool Lepidus!'\n"+
		"And threats the throat of that his officer\n"+
		"That murder'd Pompey.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"Our great navy's rigg'd.\n"+
		"EROS\n"+
		"For Italy and Caesar. More, Domitius;\n"+
		"My lord desires you presently: my news\n"+
		"I might have told hereafter.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"'Twill be naught:\n"+
		"But let it be. Bring me to Antony.\n"+
		"EROS\n"+
		"Come, sir.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE VI. Rome. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.\n"+
		"Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, and MECAENAS\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Contemning Rome, he has done all this, and more,\n"+
		"In Alexandria: here's the manner of 't:\n"+
		"I' the market-place, on a tribunal silver'd,\n"+
		"Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold\n"+
		"Were publicly enthroned: at the feet sat\n"+
		"Caesarion, whom they call my father's son,\n"+
		"And all the unlawful issue that their lust\n"+
		"Since then hath made between them. Unto her\n"+
		"He gave the stablishment of Egypt; made her\n"+
		"Of lower Syria, Cyprus, Lydia,\n"+
		"Absolute queen.\n"+
		"MECAENAS\n"+
		"This in the public eye?\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"I' the common show-place, where they exercise.\n"+
		"His sons he there proclaim'd the kings of kings:\n"+
		"Great Media, Parthia, and Armenia.\n"+
		"He gave to Alexander; to Ptolemy he assign'd\n"+
		"Syria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia: she\n"+
		"In the habiliments of the goddess Isis\n"+
		"That day appear'd; and oft before gave audience,\n"+
		"As 'tis reported, so.\n"+
		"MECAENAS\n"+
		"Let Rome be thus Inform'd.\n"+
		"AGRIPPA\n"+
		"Who, queasy with his insolence\n"+
		"Already, will their good thoughts call from him.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"The people know it; and have now received\n"+
		"His accusations.\n"+
		"AGRIPPA\n"+
		"Who does he accuse?\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Caesar: and that, having in Sicily\n"+
		"Sextus Pompeius spoil'd, we had not rated him\n"+
		"His part o' the isle: then does he say, he lent me\n"+
		"Some shipping unrestored: lastly, he frets\n"+
		"That Lepidus of the triumvirate\n"+
		"Should be deposed; and, being, that we detain\n"+
		"All his revenue.\n"+
		"AGRIPPA\n"+
		"Sir, this should be answer'd.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"'Tis done already, and the messenger gone.\n"+
		"I have told him, Lepidus was grown too cruel;\n"+
		"That he his high authority abused,\n"+
		"And did deserve his change: for what I have conquer'd,\n"+
		"I grant him part; but then, in his Armenia,\n"+
		"And other of his conquer'd kingdoms, I\n"+
		"Demand the like.\n"+
		"MECAENAS\n"+
		"He'll never yield to that.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Nor must not then be yielded to in this.\n"+
		"Enter OCTAVIA with her train\n"+
		"OCTAVIA\n"+
		"Hail, Caesar, and my lord! hail, most dear Caesar!\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"That ever I should call thee castaway!\n"+
		"OCTAVIA\n"+
		"You have not call'd me so, nor have you cause.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Why have you stol'n upon us thus! You come not\n"+
		"Like Caesar's sister: the wife of Antony\n"+
		"Should have an army for an usher, and\n"+
		"The neighs of horse to tell of her approach\n"+
		"Long ere she did appear; the trees by the way\n"+
		"Should have borne men; and expectation fainted,\n"+
		"Longing for what it had not; nay, the dust\n"+
		"Should have ascended to the roof of heaven,\n"+
		"Raised by your populous troops: but you are come\n"+
		"A market-maid to Rome; and have prevented\n"+
		"The ostentation of our love, which, left unshown,\n"+
		"Is often left unloved; we should have met you\n"+
		"By sea and land; supplying every stage\n"+
		"With an augmented greeting.\n"+
		"OCTAVIA\n"+
		"Good my lord,\n"+
		"To come thus was I not constrain'd, but did\n"+
		"On my free will. My lord, Mark Antony,\n"+
		"Hearing that you prepared for war, acquainted\n"+
		"My grieved ear withal; whereon, I begg'd\n"+
		"His pardon for return.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Which soon he granted,\n"+
		"Being an obstruct 'tween his lust and him.\n"+
		"OCTAVIA\n"+
		"Do not say so, my lord.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"I have eyes upon him,\n"+
		"And his affairs come to me on the wind.\n"+
		"Where is he now?\n"+
		"OCTAVIA\n"+
		"My lord, in Athens.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"No, my most wronged sister; Cleopatra\n"+
		"Hath nodded him to her. He hath given his empire\n"+
		"Up to a whore; who now are levying\n"+
		"The kings o' the earth for war; he hath assembled\n"+
		"Bocchus, the king of Libya; Archelaus,\n"+
		"Of Cappadocia; Philadelphos, king\n"+
		"Of Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas;\n"+
		"King Malchus of Arabia; King of Pont;\n"+
		"Herod of Jewry; Mithridates, king\n"+
		"Of Comagene; Polemon and Amyntas,\n"+
		"The kings of Mede and Lycaonia,\n"+
		"With a more larger list of sceptres.\n"+
		"OCTAVIA\n"+
		"Ay me, most wretched,\n"+
		"That have my heart parted betwixt two friends\n"+
		"That do afflict each other!\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Welcome hither:\n"+
		"Your letters did withhold our breaking forth;\n"+
		"Till we perceived, both how you were wrong led,\n"+
		"And we in negligent danger. Cheer your heart;\n"+
		"Be you not troubled with the time, which drives\n"+
		"O'er your content these strong necessities;\n"+
		"But let determined things to destiny\n"+
		"Hold unbewail'd their way. Welcome to Rome;\n"+
		"Nothing more dear to me. You are abused\n"+
		"Beyond the mark of thought: and the high gods,\n"+
		"To do you justice, make them ministers\n"+
		"Of us and those that love you. Best of comfort;\n"+
		"And ever welcome to us.\n"+
		"AGRIPPA\n"+
		"Welcome, lady.\n"+
		"MECAENAS\n"+
		"Welcome, dear madam.\n"+
		"Each heart in Rome does love and pity you:\n"+
		"Only the adulterous Antony, most large\n"+
		"In his abominations, turns you off;\n"+
		"And gives his potent regiment to a trull,\n"+
		"That noises it against us.\n"+
		"OCTAVIA\n"+
		"Is it so, sir?\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Most certain. Sister, welcome: pray you,\n"+
		"Be ever known to patience: my dear'st sister!\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE VII. Near Actium. MARK ANTONY's camp.\n"+
		"Enter CLEOPATRA and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"I will be even with thee, doubt it not.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"But why, why, why?\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars,\n"+
		"And say'st it is not fit.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"Well, is it, is it?\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"If not denounced against us, why should not we\n"+
		"Be there in person?\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"[Aside] Well, I could reply:\n"+
		"If we should serve with horse and mares together,\n"+
		"The horse were merely lost; the mares would bear\n"+
		"A soldier and his horse.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"What is't you say?\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"Your presence needs must puzzle Antony;\n"+
		"Take from his heart, take from his brain,\n"+
		"from's time,\n"+
		"What should not then be spared. He is already\n"+
		"Traduced for levity; and 'tis said in Rome\n"+
		"That Photinus an eunuch and your maids\n"+
		"Manage this war.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Sink Rome, and their tongues rot\n"+
		"That speak against us! A charge we bear i' the war,\n"+
		"And, as the president of my kingdom, will\n"+
		"Appear there for a man. Speak not against it:\n"+
		"I will not stay behind.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"Nay, I have done.\n"+
		"Here comes the emperor.\n"+
		"Enter MARK ANTONY and CANIDIUS\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Is it not strange, Canidius,\n"+
		"That from Tarentum and Brundusium\n"+
		"He could so quickly cut the Ionian sea,\n"+
		"And take in Toryne? You have heard on't, sweet?\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Celerity is never more admired\n"+
		"Than by the negligent.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"A good rebuke,\n"+
		"Which might have well becomed the best of men,\n"+
		"To taunt at slackness. Canidius, we\n"+
		"Will fight with him by sea.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"By sea! what else?\n"+
		"CANIDIUS\n"+
		"Why will my lord do so?\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"For that he dares us to't.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"So hath my lord dared him to single fight.\n"+
		"CANIDIUS\n"+
		"Ay, and to wage this battle at Pharsalia.\n"+
		"Where Caesar fought with Pompey: but these offers,\n"+
		"Which serve not for his vantage, be shakes off;\n"+
		"And so should you.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"Your ships are not well mann'd;\n"+
		"Your mariners are muleters, reapers, people\n"+
		"Ingross'd by swift impress; in Caesar's fleet\n"+
		"Are those that often have 'gainst Pompey fought:\n"+
		"Their ships are yare; yours, heavy: no disgrace\n"+
		"Shall fall you for refusing him at sea,\n"+
		"Being prepared for land.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"By sea, by sea.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"Most worthy sir, you therein throw away\n"+
		"The absolute soldiership you have by land;\n"+
		"Distract your army, which doth most consist\n"+
		"Of war-mark'd footmen; leave unexecuted\n"+
		"Your own renowned knowledge; quite forego\n"+
		"The way which promises assurance; and\n"+
		"Give up yourself merely to chance and hazard,\n"+
		"From firm security.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"I'll fight at sea.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"I have sixty sails, Caesar none better.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Our overplus of shipping will we burn;\n"+
		"And, with the rest full-mann'd, from the head of Actium\n"+
		"Beat the approaching Caesar. But if we fail,\n"+
		"We then can do't at land.\n"+
		"Enter a Messenger\n"+
		"Thy business?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"The news is true, my lord; he is descried;\n"+
		"Caesar has taken Toryne.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Can he be there in person? 'tis impossible;\n"+
		"Strange that power should be. Canidius,\n"+
		"Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land,\n"+
		"And our twelve thousand horse. We'll to our ship:\n"+
		"Away, my Thetis!\n"+
		"Enter a Soldier\n"+
		"How now, worthy soldier?\n"+
		"Soldier\n"+
		"O noble emperor, do not fight by sea;\n"+
		"Trust not to rotten planks: do you misdoubt\n"+
		"This sword and these my wounds? Let the Egyptians\n"+
		"And the Phoenicians go a-ducking; we\n"+
		"Have used to conquer, standing on the earth,\n"+
		"And fighting foot to foot.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Well, well: away!\n"+
		"Exeunt MARK ANTONY, QUEEN CLEOPATRA, and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"Soldier\n"+
		"By Hercules, I think I am i' the right.\n"+
		"CANIDIUS\n"+
		"Soldier, thou art: but his whole action grows\n"+
		"Not in the power on't: so our leader's led,\n"+
		"And we are women's men.\n"+
		"Soldier\n"+
		"You keep by land\n"+
		"The legions and the horse whole, do you not?\n"+
		"CANIDIUS\n"+
		"Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius,\n"+
		"Publicola, and Caelius, are for sea:\n"+
		"But we keep whole by land. This speed of Caesar's\n"+
		"Carries beyond belief.\n"+
		"Soldier\n"+
		"While he was yet in Rome,\n"+
		"His power went out in such distractions as\n"+
		"Beguiled all spies.\n"+
		"CANIDIUS\n"+
		"Who's his lieutenant, hear you?\n"+
		"Soldier\n"+
		"They say, one Taurus.\n"+
		"CANIDIUS\n"+
		"Well I know the man.\n"+
		"Enter a Messenger\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"The emperor calls Canidius.\n"+
		"CANIDIUS\n"+
		"With news the time's with labour, and throes forth,\n"+
		"Each minute, some.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+

		"Taurus!\n"+
		"TAURUS\n"+
		"My lord?\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Strike not by land; keep whole: provoke not battle,\n"+
		"Till we have done at sea. Do not exceed\n"+
		"The prescript of this scroll: our fortune lies\n"+
		"Upon this jump.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IX. Another part of the plain.\n"+
		"Enter MARK ANTONY and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Set we our squadrons on yond side o' the hill,\n"+
		"In eye of Caesar's battle; from which place\n"+
		"We may the number of the ships behold,\n"+
		"And so proceed accordingly.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE X. Another part of the plain.\n"+
		"CANIDIUS marcheth with his land army one way over the stage; and TAURUS, the lieutenant of OCTAVIUS CAESAR, the other way. After their going in, is heard the noise of a sea-fight\n"+
		"Alarum. Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"Naught, naught all, naught! I can behold no longer:\n"+
		"The Antoniad, the Egyptian admiral,\n"+

		"What's thy passion!\n"+
		"SCARUS\n"+
		"The greater cantle of the world is lost\n"+
		"With very ignorance; we have kiss'd away\n"+
		"Kingdoms and provinces.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"How appears the fight?\n"+
		"SCARUS\n"+
		"On our side like the token'd pestilence,\n"+
		"Where death is sure. Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt,--\n"+
		"Whom leprosy o'ertake!--i' the midst o' the fight,\n"+
		"When vantage like a pair of twins appear'd,\n"+
		"Both as the same, or rather ours the elder,\n"+
		"The breese upon her, like a cow in June,\n"+
		"Hoists sails and flies.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"That I beheld:\n"+
		"Mine eyes did sicken at the sight, and could not\n"+
		"Endure a further view.\n"+
		"SCARUS\n"+
		"She once being loof'd,\n"+
		"The noble ruin of her magic, Antony,\n"+
		"Claps on his sea-wing, and, like a doting mallard,\n"+
		"Leaving the fight in height, flies after her:\n"+
		"I never saw an action of such shame;\n"+
		"Experience, manhood, honour, ne'er before\n"+
		"Did violate so itself.\n"+

		"Alack, alack!\n"+
		"Enter CANIDIUS\n"+
		"CANIDIUS\n"+
		"Our fortune on the sea is out of breath,\n"+
		"And sinks most lamentably. Had our general\n"+
		"Been what he knew himself, it had gone well:\n"+
		"O, he has given example for our flight,\n"+
		"Most grossly, by his own!\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"Ay, are you thereabouts?\n"+
		"Why, then, good night indeed.\n"+
		"CANIDIUS\n"+
		"Toward Peloponnesus are they fled.\n"+
		"SCARUS\n"+
		"'Tis easy to't; and there I will attend\n"+
		"What further comes.\n"+

		"To Caesar will I render\n"+
		"My legions and my horse: six kings already\n"+
		"Show me the way of yielding.\n"+

		"Hark! the land bids me tread no more upon't;\n"+
		"It is ashamed to bear me! Friends, come hither:\n"+
		"I am so lated in the world, that I\n"+

		"And make your peace with Caesar.\n"+
		"All\n"+
		"Fly! not we.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"I have fled myself; and have instructed cowards\n"+
		"To run and show their shoulders. Friends, be gone;\n"+
		"I have myself resolved upon a course\n"+
		"Which has no need of you; be gone:\n"+
		"My treasure's in the harbour, take it. O,\n"+
		"I follow'd that I blush to look upon:\n"+
		"My very hairs do mutiny; for the white\n"+
		"Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them\n"+
		"For fear and doting. Friends, be gone: you shall\n"+
		"Have letters from me to some friends that will\n"+
		"Sweep your way for you. Pray you, look not sad,\n"+
		"Nor make replies of loathness: take the hint\n"+
		"Which my despair proclaims; let that be left\n"+
		"Which leaves itself: to the sea-side straightway:\n"+
		"I will possess you of that ship and treasure.\n"+
		"Leave me, I pray, a little: pray you now:\n"+

		"EROS\n"+
		"Most noble sir, arise; the queen approaches:\n"+
		"Her head's declined, and death will seize her, but\n"+

		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"I have offended reputation,\n"+
		"A most unnoble swerving.\n"+
		"EROS\n"+
		"Sir, the queen.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"O, whither hast thou led me, Egypt? See,\n"+
		"How I convey my shame out of thine eyes\n"+
		"By looking back what I have left behind\n"+
		"'Stroy'd in dishonour.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"O my lord, my lord,\n"+
		"Forgive my fearful sails! I little thought\n"+
		"You would have follow'd.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Egypt, thou knew'st too well\n"+
		"My heart was to thy rudder tied by the strings,\n"+
		"And thou shouldst tow me after: o'er my spirit\n"+
		"Thy full supremacy thou knew'st, and that\n"+
		"Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods\n"+
		"Command me.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"O, my pardon!\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Now I must\n"+
		"To the young man send humble treaties, dodge\n"+
		"And palter in the shifts of lowness; who\n"+
		"With half the bulk o' the world play'd as I pleased,\n"+
		"Making and marring fortunes. You did know\n"+
		"How much you were my conqueror; and that\n"+
		"My sword, made weak by my affection, would\n"+
		"Obey it on all cause.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+

		"MARK ANTONY\n"+

		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE XII. Egypt. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.\n"+
		"Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, DOLABELLA, THYREUS, with others\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Let him appear that's come from Antony.\n"+
		"Know you him?\n"+
		"DOLABELLA\n"+
		"Caesar, 'tis his schoolmaster:\n"+
		"An argument that he is pluck'd, when hither\n"+
		"He sends so poor a pinion off his wing,\n"+
		"Which had superfluous kings for messengers\n"+
		"Not many moons gone by.\n"+
		"Enter EUPHRONIUS, ambassador from MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Approach, and speak.\n"+
		"EUPHRONIUS\n"+
		"Such as I am, I come from Antony:\n"+
		"I was of late as petty to his ends\n"+
		"As is the morn-dew on the myrtle-leaf\n"+
		"To his grand sea.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Be't so: declare thine office.\n"+
		"EUPHRONIUS\n"+
		"Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee, and\n"+
		"Requires to live in Egypt: which not granted,\n"+
		"He lessens his requests; and to thee sues\n"+
		"To let him breathe between the heavens and earth,\n"+
		"A private man in Athens: this for him.\n"+
		"Next, Cleopatra does confess thy greatness;\n"+
		"Submits her to thy might; and of thee craves\n"+
		"The circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs,\n"+
		"Now hazarded to thy grace.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"For Antony,\n"+
		"I have no ears to his request. The queen\n"+
		"Of audience nor desire shall fail, so she\n"+
		"From Egypt drive her all-disgraced friend,\n"+
		"Or take his life there: this if she perform,\n"+
		"She shall not sue unheard. So to them both.\n"+
		"EUPHRONIUS\n"+
		"Fortune pursue thee!\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Bring him through the bands.\n"+
		"Exit EUPHRONIUS\n"+

		"Make thine own edict for thy pains, which we\n"+
		"Will answer as a law.\n"+
		"THYREUS\n"+
		"Caesar, I go.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Observe how Antony becomes his flaw,\n"+
		"And what thou think'st his very action speaks\n"+
		"In every power that moves.\n"+
		"THYREUS\n"+
		"Caesar, I shall.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE XIII. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.\n"+

		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"What shall we do, Enobarbus?\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"Think, and die.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Is Antony or we in fault for this?\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"Antony only, that would make his will\n"+
		"Lord of his reason. What though you fled\n"+
		"From that great face of war, whose several ranges\n"+
		"Frighted each other? why should he follow?\n"+
		"The itch of his affection should not then\n"+
		"Have nick'd his captainship; at such a point,\n"+
		"When half to half the world opposed, he being\n"+
		"The meered question: 'twas a shame no less\n"+

		"Prithee, peace.\n"+
		"Enter MARK ANTONY with EUPHRONIUS, the Ambassador\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Is that his answer?\n"+

		"Ay, my lord.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"The queen shall then have courtesy, so she\n"+
		"Will yield us up.\n"+
		"EUPHRONIUS\n"+
		"He says so.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Let her know't.\n"+
		"To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head,\n"+
		"And he will fill thy wishes to the brim\n"+
		"With principalities.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"That head, my lord?\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"To him again: tell him he wears the rose\n"+
		"Of youth upon him; from which the world should note\n"+
		"Something particular: his coin, ships, legions,\n"+
		"May be a coward's; whose ministers would prevail\n"+
		"Under the service of a child as soon\n"+
		"As i' the command of Caesar: I dare him therefore\n"+
		"To lay his gay comparisons apart,\n"+
		"And answer me declined, sword against sword,\n"+
		"Ourselves alone. I'll write it: follow me.\n"+
		"Exeunt MARK ANTONY and EUPHRONIUS\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"[Aside] Yes, like enough, high-battled Caesar will\n"+
		"Unstate his happiness, and be staged to the show,\n"+
		"Against a sworder! I see men's judgments are\n"+
		"A parcel of their fortunes; and things outward\n"+
		"Do draw the inward quality after them,\n"+
		"To suffer all alike. That he should dream,\n"+
		"Knowing all measures, the full Caesar will\n"+
		"Answer his emptiness! Caesar, thou hast subdued\n"+
		"His judgment too.\n"+
		"Enter an Attendant\n"+
		"Attendant\n"+
		"A messenger from CAESAR.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"What, no more ceremony? See, my women!\n"+
		"Against the blown rose may they stop their nose\n"+
		"That kneel'd unto the buds. Admit him, sir.\n"+
		"Exit Attendant\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"[Aside] Mine honesty and I begin to square.\n"+
		"The loyalty well held to fools does make\n"+
		"Our faith mere folly: yet he that can endure\n"+
		"To follow with allegiance a fall'n lord\n"+
		"Does conquer him that did his master conquer\n"+
		"And earns a place i' the story.\n"+
		"Enter THYREUS\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Caesar's will?\n"+
		"THYREUS\n"+
		"Hear it apart.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"None but friends: say boldly.\n"+
		"THYREUS\n"+
		"So, haply, are they friends to Antony.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has;\n"+
		"Or needs not us. If Caesar please, our master\n"+
		"Will leap to be his friend: for us, you know,\n"+
		"Whose he is we are, and that is, Caesar's.\n"+
		"THYREUS\n"+
		"So.\n"+
		"Thus then, thou most renown'd: Caesar entreats,\n"+
		"Not to consider in what case thou stand'st,\n"+
		"Further than he is Caesar.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Go on: right royal.\n"+
		"THYREUS\n"+
		"He knows that you embrace not Antony\n"+
		"As you did love, but as you fear'd him.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"O!\n"+
		"THYREUS\n"+
		"The scars upon your honour, therefore, he\n"+
		"Does pity, as constrained blemishes,\n"+
		"Not as deserved.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"He is a god, and knows\n"+
		"What is most right: mine honour was not yielded,\n"+
		"But conquer'd merely.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"[Aside] To be sure of that,\n"+
		"I will ask Antony. Sir, sir, thou art so leaky,\n"+
		"That we must leave thee to thy sinking, for\n"+
		"Thy dearest quit thee.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"THYREUS\n"+
		"Shall I say to Caesar\n"+
		"What you require of him? for he partly begs\n"+
		"To be desired to give. It much would please him,\n"+
		"That of his fortunes you should make a staff\n"+
		"To lean upon: but it would warm his spirits,\n"+
		"To hear from me you had left Antony,\n"+
		"And put yourself under his shrowd,\n"+
		"The universal landlord.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"What's your name?\n"+
		"THYREUS\n"+
		"My name is Thyreus.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Most kind messenger,\n"+
		"Say to great Caesar this: in deputation\n"+
		"I kiss his conquering hand: tell him, I am prompt\n"+
		"To lay my crown at 's feet, and there to kneel:\n"+
		"Tell him from his all-obeying breath I hear\n"+
		"The doom of Egypt.\n"+
		"THYREUS\n"+
		"'Tis your noblest course.\n"+
		"Wisdom and fortune combating together,\n"+
		"If that the former dare but what it can,\n"+
		"No chance may shake it. Give me grace to lay\n"+
		"My duty on your hand.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Your Caesar's father oft,\n"+
		"When he hath mused of taking kingdoms in,\n"+
		"Bestow'd his lips on that unworthy place,\n"+
		"As it rain'd kisses.\n"+
		"Re-enter MARK ANTONY and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Favours, by Jove that thunders!\n"+
		"What art thou, fellow?\n"+
		"THYREUS\n"+
		"One that but performs\n"+
		"The bidding of the fullest man, and worthiest\n"+
		"To have command obey'd.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"[Aside] You will be whipp'd.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Approach, there! Ah, you kite! Now, gods\n"+
		"and devils!\n"+
		"Authority melts from me: of late, when I cried 'Ho!'\n"+
		"Like boys unto a muss, kings would start forth,\n"+
		"And cry 'Your will?' Have you no ears? I am\n"+
		"Antony yet.\n"+
		"Enter Attendants\n"+
		"Take hence this Jack, and whip him.\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"[Aside] 'Tis better playing with a lion's whelp\n"+
		"Than with an old one dying.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Moon and stars!\n"+
		"Whip him. Were't twenty of the greatest tributaries\n"+
		"That do acknowledge Caesar, should I find them\n"+
		"So saucy with the hand of she here,--what's her name,\n"+
		"Since she was Cleopatra? Whip him, fellows,\n"+
		"Till, like a boy, you see him cringe his face,\n"+
		"And whine aloud for mercy: take him hence.\n"+
		"THYREUS\n"+
		"Mark Antony!\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Tug him away: being whipp'd,\n"+
		"Bring him again: this Jack of Caesar's shall\n"+
		"Bear us an errand to him.\n"+
		"Exeunt Attendants with THYREUS\n"+
		"You were half blasted ere I knew you: ha!\n"+
		"Have I my pillow left unpress'd in Rome,\n"+
		"Forborne the getting of a lawful race,\n"+
		"And by a gem of women, to be abused\n"+
		"By one that looks on feeders?\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Good my lord,--\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"You have been a boggler ever:\n"+
		"But when we in our viciousness grow hard--\n"+
		"O misery on't!--the wise gods seel our eyes;\n"+
		"In our own filth drop our clear judgments; make us\n"+
		"Adore our errors; laugh at's, while we strut\n"+
		"To our confusion.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"O, is't come to this?\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"I found you as a morsel cold upon\n"+
		"Dead Caesar's trencher; nay, you were a fragment\n"+
		"Of Cneius Pompey's; besides what hotter hours,\n"+
		"Unregister'd in vulgar fame, you have\n"+
		"Luxuriously pick'd out: for, I am sure,\n"+
		"Though you can guess what temperance should be,\n"+
		"You know not what it is.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Wherefore is this?\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"To let a fellow that will take rewards\n"+
		"And say 'God quit you!' be familiar with\n"+
		"My playfellow, your hand; this kingly seal\n"+
		"And plighter of high hearts! O, that I were\n"+
		"Upon the hill of Basan, to outroar\n"+
		"The horned herd! for I have savage cause;\n"+
		"And to proclaim it civilly, were like\n"+
		"A halter'd neck which does the hangman thank\n"+
		"For being yare about him.\n"+
		"Re-enter Attendants with THYREUS\n"+
		"Is he whipp'd?\n"+
		"First Attendant\n"+
		"Soundly, my lord.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Cried he? and begg'd a' pardon?\n"+
		"First Attendant\n"+
		"He did ask favour.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"If that thy father live, let him repent\n"+
		"Thou wast not made his daughter; and be thou sorry\n"+
		"To follow Caesar in his triumph, since\n"+
		"Thou hast been whipp'd for following him: henceforth\n"+
		"The white hand of a lady fever thee,\n"+
		"Shake thou to look on 't. Get thee back to Caesar,\n"+
		"Tell him thy entertainment: look, thou say\n"+
		"He makes me angry with him; for he seems\n"+
		"Proud and disdainful, harping on what I am,\n"+
		"Not what he knew I was: he makes me angry;\n"+
		"And at this time most easy 'tis to do't,\n"+
		"When my good stars, that were my former guides,\n"+
		"Have empty left their orbs, and shot their fires\n"+
		"Into the abysm of hell. If he mislike\n"+
		"My speech and what is done, tell him he has\n"+
		"Hipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whom\n"+
		"He may at pleasure whip, or hang, or torture,\n"+
		"As he shall like, to quit me: urge it thou:\n"+
		"Hence with thy stripes, begone!\n"+
		"Exit THYREUS\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Have you done yet?\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Alack, our terrene moon\n"+
		"Is now eclipsed; and it portends alone\n"+
		"The fall of Antony!\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"I must stay his time.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"To flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyes\n"+
		"With one that ties his points?\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Not know me yet?\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Cold-hearted toward me?\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Ah, dear, if I be so,\n"+
		"From my cold heart let heaven engender hail,\n"+
		"And poison it in the source; and the first stone\n"+
		"Drop in my neck: as it determines, so\n"+
		"Dissolve my life! The next Caesarion smite!\n"+
		"Till by degrees the memory of my womb,\n"+
		"Together with my brave Egyptians all,\n"+
		"By the discandying of this pelleted storm,\n"+
		"Lie graveless, till the flies and gnats of Nile\n"+
		"Have buried them for prey!\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"I am satisfied.\n"+
		"Caesar sits down in Alexandria; where\n"+
		"I will oppose his fate. Our force by land\n"+
		"Hath nobly held; our sever'd navy too\n"+
		"Have knit again, and fleet, threatening most sea-like.\n"+
		"Where hast thou been, my heart? Dost thou hear, lady?\n"+
		"If from the field I shall return once more\n"+
		"To kiss these lips, I will appear in blood;\n"+
		"I and my sword will earn our chronicle:\n"+
		"There's hope in't yet.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"That's my brave lord!\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"I will be treble-sinew'd, hearted, breathed,\n"+
		"And fight maliciously: for when mine hours\n"+
		"Were nice and lucky, men did ransom lives\n"+
		"Of me for jests; but now I'll set my teeth,\n"+
		"And send to darkness all that stop me. Come,\n"+
		"Let's have one other gaudy night: call to me\n"+
		"All my sad captains; fill our bowls once more;\n"+
		"Let's mock the midnight bell.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"It is my birth-day:\n"+
		"I had thought to have held it poor: but, since my lord\n"+
		"Is Antony again, I will be Cleopatra.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"We will yet do well.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Call all his noble captains to my lord.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Do so, we'll speak to them; and to-night I'll force\n"+
		"The wine peep through their scars. Come on, my queen;\n"+
		"There's sap in't yet. The next time I do fight,\n"+
		"I'll make death love me; for I will contend\n"+
		"Even with his pestilent scythe.\n"+
		"Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"Now he'll outstare the lightning. To be furious,\n"+
		"Is to be frighted out of fear; and in that mood\n"+
		"The dove will peck the estridge; and I see still,\n"+
		"A diminution in our captain's brain\n"+
		"Restores his heart: when valour preys on reason,\n"+
		"It eats the sword it fights with. I will seek\n"+
		"Some way to leave him.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"ACT IV\n"+
		"SCENE I. Before Alexandria. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.\n"+
		"Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, and MECAENAS, with his Army; OCTAVIUS CAESAR reading a letter\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"He calls me boy; and chides, as he had power\n"+
		"To beat me out of Egypt; my messenger\n"+
		"He hath whipp'd with rods; dares me to personal combat,\n"+
		"Caesar to Antony: let the old ruffian know\n"+
		"I have many other ways to die; meantime\n"+
		"Laugh at his challenge.\n"+
		"MECAENAS\n"+
		"Caesar must think,\n"+
		"When one so great begins to rage, he's hunted\n"+
		"Even to falling. Give him no breath, but now\n"+
		"Make boot of his distraction: never anger\n"+
		"Made good guard for itself.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Let our best heads\n"+
		"Know, that to-morrow the last of many battles\n"+
		"We mean to fight: within our files there are,\n"+
		"Of those that served Mark Antony but late,\n"+
		"Enough to fetch him in. See it done:\n"+
		"And feast the army; we have store to do't,\n"+
		"And they have earn'd the waste. Poor Antony!\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+

		"No.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Why should he not?\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"He thinks, being twenty times of better fortune,\n"+
		"He is twenty men to one.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"To-morrow, soldier,\n"+
		"By sea and land I'll fight: or I will live,\n"+
		"Or bathe my dying honour in the blood\n"+
		"Shall make it live again. Woo't thou fight well?\n"+
		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"I'll strike, and cry 'Take all.'\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Well said; come on.\n"+
		"Call forth my household servants: let's to-night\n"+

		"DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS\n"+
		"[Aside to CLEOPATRA] 'Tis one of those odd\n"+

		"May be it is the period of your duty:\n"+
		"Haply you shall not see me more; or if,\n"+
		"A mangled shadow: perchance to-morrow\n"+
		"You'll serve another master. I look on you\n"+
		"As one that takes his leave. Mine honest friends,\n"+

		"Now the witch take me, if I meant it thus!\n"+
		"Grace grow where those drops fall!\n"+

		"Sometimes we see a cloud that's dragonish;\n"+
		"A vapour sometime like a bear or lion,\n"+
		"A tower'd citadel, a pendent rock,\n"+
		"A forked mountain, or blue promontory\n"+
		"With trees upon't, that nod unto the world,\n"+
		"And mock our eyes with air: thou hast seen\n"+
		"these signs;\n"+

		"Ay, my lord,\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"That which is now a horse, even with a thought\n"+
		"The rack dislimns, and makes it indistinct,\n"+

		"It does, my lord.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"My good knave Eros, now thy captain is\n"+
		"Even such a body: here I am Antony:\n"+
		"Yet cannot hold this visible shape, my knave.\n"+

		"Whose heart I thought I had, for she had mine;\n"+
		"Which whilst it was mine had annex'd unto't\n"+
		"A million more, now lost,--she, Eros, has\n"+
		"Pack'd cards with Caesar, and false-play'd my glory\n"+
		"Unto an enemy's triumph.\n"+
		"Nay, weep not, gentle Eros; there is left us\n"+
		"Ourselves to end ourselves.\n"+
		"Enter MARDIAN\n"+
		"O! thy vile lady!\n"+
		"She has robb'd me of my sword.\n"+
		"MARDIAN\n"+

		"My mistress loved thee, and her fortunes mingled\n"+
		"With thine entirely.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Hence, saucy eunuch; peace!\n"+
		"She hath betray'd me and shall die the death.\n"+
		"MARDIAN\n"+
		"Death of one person can be paid but once,\n"+
		"And that she has discharged: what thou wouldst do\n"+
		"Is done unto thy hand: the last she spake\n"+
		"Was 'Antony! most noble Antony!'\n"+
		"Then in the midst a tearing groan did break\n"+
		"The name of Antony; it was divided\n"+
		"Between her heart and lips: she render'd life,\n"+
		"Thy name so buried in her.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Dead, then?\n"+
		"MARDIAN\n"+
		"Dead.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Unarm, Eros; the long day's task is done,\n"+
		"And we must sleep.\n"+
		"To MARDIAN\n"+
		"That thou depart'st hence safe,\n"+
		"Does pay thy labour richly; go.\n"+
		"Exit MARDIAN\n"+
		"Off, pluck off:\n"+
		"The seven-fold shield of Ajax cannot keep\n"+

		"Re-enter EROS\n"+
		"EROS\n"+
		"What would my lord?\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Since Cleopatra died,\n"+
		"I have lived in such dishonour, that the gods\n"+
		"Detest my baseness. I, that with my sword\n"+
		"Quarter'd the world, and o'er green Neptune's back\n"+
		"With ships made cities, condemn myself to lack\n"+
		"The courage of a woman; less noble mind\n"+
		"Than she which by her death our Caesar tells\n"+
		"'I am conqueror of myself.' Thou art sworn, Eros,\n"+
		"That, when the exigent should come, which now\n"+
		"Is come indeed, when I should see behind me\n"+
		"The inevitable prosecution of\n"+
		"Disgrace and horror, that, on my command,\n"+
		"Thou then wouldst kill me: do't; the time is come:\n"+
		"Thou strikest not me, 'tis Caesar thou defeat'st.\n"+
		"Put colour in thy cheek.\n"+
		"EROS\n"+
		"The gods withhold me!\n"+
		"Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts,\n"+
		"Though enemy, lost aim, and could not?\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Eros,\n"+
		"Wouldst thou be window'd in great Rome and see\n"+
		"Thy master thus with pleach'd arms, bending down\n"+
		"His corrigible neck, his face subdued\n"+
		"To penetrative shame, whilst the wheel'd seat\n"+
		"Of fortunate Caesar, drawn before him, branded\n"+
		"His baseness that ensued?\n"+
		"EROS\n"+
		"I would not see't.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Come, then; for with a wound I must be cured.\n"+
		"Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn\n"+
		"Most useful for thy country.\n"+
		"EROS\n"+
		"O, sir, pardon me!\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"When I did make thee free, sworest thou not then\n"+
		"To do this when I bade thee? Do it at once;\n"+
		"Or thy precedent services are all\n"+
		"But accidents unpurposed. Draw, and come.\n"+
		"EROS\n"+
		"Turn from me, then, that noble countenance,\n"+
		"Wherein the worship of the whole world lies.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Lo thee!\n"+
		"Turning from him\n"+
		"EROS\n"+
		"My sword is drawn.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Then let it do at once\n"+

		"EROS\n"+
		"My dear master,\n"+
		"My captain, and my emperor, let me say,\n"+
		"Before I strike this bloody stroke, farewell.\n"+

		"Why, there then: thus I do escape the sorrow\n"+
		"Of Antony's death.\n"+
		"Kills himself\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Thrice-nobler than myself!\n"+
		"Thou teachest me, O valiant Eros, what\n"+

		"Have by their brave instruction got upon me\n"+
		"A nobleness in record: but I will be\n"+
		"A bridegroom in my death, and run into't\n"+
		"As to a lover's bed. Come, then; and, Eros,\n"+
		"Thy master dies thy scholar: to do thus\n"+
		"Falling on his sword\n"+
		"I learn'd of thee. How! not dead? not dead?\n"+
		"The guard, ho! O, dispatch me!\n"+
		"Enter DERCETAS and Guard\n"+
		"First Guard\n"+
		"What's the noise?\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+

		"Of what I have begun.\n"+

		"First Guard\n"+
		"And time is at his period.\n"+
		"All\n"+
		"Alas, and woe!\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Let him that loves me strike me dead.\n"+
		"First Guard\n"+
		"Not I.\n"+
		"Second Guard\n"+
		"Nor I.\n"+
		"Third Guard\n"+
		"Nor any one.\n"+
		"Exeunt Guard\n"+
		"DERCETAS\n"+
		"Thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly.\n"+
		"This sword but shown to Caesar, with this tidings,\n"+
		"Shall enter me with him.\n"+
		"Enter DIOMEDES\n"+
		"DIOMEDES\n"+
		"Where's Antony?\n"+
		"DERCETAS\n"+
		"There, Diomed there.\n"+
		"DIOMEDES\n"+
		"Lives he?\n"+
		"Wilt thou not answer, man?\n"+
		"Exit DERCETAS\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Art thou there, Diomed? Draw thy sword, and give me\n"+
		"Sufficing strokes for death.\n"+
		"DIOMEDES\n"+
		"Most absolute lord,\n"+
		"My mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"When did she send thee?\n"+
		"DIOMEDES\n"+
		"Now, my lord.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Where is she?\n"+
		"DIOMEDES\n"+
		"Lock'd in her monument. She had a prophesying fear\n"+
		"Of what hath come to pass: for when she saw--\n"+
		"Which never shall be found--you did suspect\n"+
		"She had disposed with Caesar, and that your rage\n"+
		"Would not be purged, she sent you word she was dead;\n"+
		"But, fearing since how it might work, hath sent\n"+
		"Me to proclaim the truth; and I am come,\n"+
		"I dread, too late.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Too late, good Diomed: call my guard, I prithee.\n"+
		"DIOMEDES\n"+
		"What, ho, the emperor's guard! The guard, what, ho!\n"+
		"Come, your lord calls!\n"+
		"Enter four or five of the Guard of MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Bear me, good friends, where Cleopatra bides;\n"+
		"'Tis the last service that I shall command you.\n"+
		"First Guard\n"+
		"Woe, woe are we, sir, you may not live to wear\n"+
		"All your true followers out.\n"+
		"All\n"+
		"Most heavy day!\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Nay, good my fellows, do not please sharp fate\n"+
		"To grace it with your sorrows: bid that welcome\n"+
		"Which comes to punish us, and we punish it\n"+
		"Seeming to bear it lightly. Take me up:\n"+
		"I have led you oft: carry me now, good friends,\n"+
		"And have my thanks for all.\n"+
		"Exeunt, bearing MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"SCENE XV. The same. A monument.\n"+
		"Enter CLEOPATRA and her maids aloft, with CHARMIAN and IRAS\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"O Charmian, I will never go from hence.\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"Be comforted, dear madam.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"No, I will not:\n"+
		"All strange and terrible events are welcome,\n"+
		"But comforts we despise; our size of sorrow,\n"+
		"Proportion'd to our cause, must be as great\n"+
		"As that which makes it.\n"+
		"Enter, below, DIOMEDES\n"+
		"How now! is he dead?\n"+
		"DIOMEDES\n"+
		"His death's upon him, but not dead.\n"+
		"Look out o' the other side your monument;\n"+
		"His guard have brought him thither.\n"+
		"Enter, below, MARK ANTONY, borne by the Guard\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"O sun,\n"+
		"Burn the great sphere thou movest in!\n"+
		"darkling stand\n"+
		"The varying shore o' the world. O Antony,\n"+
		"Antony, Antony! Help, Charmian, help, Iras, help;\n"+
		"Help, friends below; let's draw him hither.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Peace!\n"+
		"Not Caesar's valour hath o'erthrown Antony,\n"+
		"But Antony's hath triumph'd on itself.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"So it should be, that none but Antony\n"+
		"Should conquer Antony; but woe 'tis so!\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"I am dying, Egypt, dying; only\n"+
		"I here importune death awhile, until\n"+
		"Of many thousand kisses the poor last\n"+
		"I lay up thy lips.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"I dare not, dear,--\n"+
		"Dear my lord, pardon,--I dare not,\n"+
		"Lest I be taken: not the imperious show\n"+
		"Of the full-fortuned Caesar ever shall\n"+
		"Be brooch'd with me; if knife, drugs,\n"+
		"serpents, have\n"+
		"Edge, sting, or operation, I am safe:\n"+
		"Your wife Octavia, with her modest eyes\n"+
		"And still conclusion, shall acquire no honour\n"+
		"Demuring upon me. But come, come, Antony,--\n"+
		"Help me, my women,--we must draw thee up:\n"+
		"Assist, good friends.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"O, quick, or I am gone.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Here's sport indeed! How heavy weighs my lord!\n"+
		"Our strength is all gone into heaviness,\n"+
		"That makes the weight: had I great Juno's power,\n"+
		"The strong-wing'd Mercury should fetch thee up,\n"+
		"And set thee by Jove's side. Yet come a little,--\n"+
		"Wishes were ever fools,--O, come, come, come;\n"+
		"They heave MARK ANTONY aloft to CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"And welcome, welcome! die where thou hast lived:\n"+
		"Quicken with kissing: had my lips that power,\n"+
		"Thus would I wear them out.\n"+
		"All\n"+
		"A heavy sight!\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"I am dying, Egypt, dying:\n"+
		"Give me some wine, and let me speak a little.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"No, let me speak; and let me rail so high,\n"+
		"That the false housewife Fortune break her wheel,\n"+
		"Provoked by my offence.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"One word, sweet queen:\n"+
		"Of Caesar seek your honour, with your safety. O!\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"They do not go together.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"Gentle, hear me:\n"+
		"None about Caesar trust but Proculeius.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"My resolution and my hands I'll trust;\n"+
		"None about Caesar.\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"The miserable change now at my end\n"+
		"Lament nor sorrow at; but please your thoughts\n"+
		"In feeding them with those my former fortunes\n"+
		"Wherein I lived, the greatest prince o' the world,\n"+
		"The noblest; and do now not basely die,\n"+
		"Not cowardly put off my helmet to\n"+
		"My countryman,--a Roman by a Roman\n"+
		"Valiantly vanquish'd. Now my spirit is going;\n"+
		"I can no more.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Noblest of men, woo't die?\n"+
		"Hast thou no care of me? shall I abide\n"+
		"In this dull world, which in thy absence is\n"+
		"No better than a sty? O, see, my women,\n"+
		"MARK ANTONY dies\n"+
		"The crown o' the earth doth melt. My lord!\n"+
		"O, wither'd is the garland of the war,\n"+
		"The soldier's pole is fall'n: young boys and girls\n"+
		"Are level now with men; the odds is gone,\n"+
		"And there is nothing left remarkable\n"+
		"Beneath the visiting moon.\n"+
		"Faints\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"O, quietness, lady!\n"+
		"IRAS\n"+
		"She is dead too, our sovereign.\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"Lady!\n"+
		"IRAS\n"+
		"Madam!\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"O madam, madam, madam!\n"+
		"IRAS\n"+
		"Royal Egypt, Empress!\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"Peace, peace, Iras!\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"No more, but e'en a woman, and commanded\n"+
		"By such poor passion as the maid that milks\n"+
		"And does the meanest chares. It were for me\n"+
		"To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods;\n"+
		"To tell them that this world did equal theirs\n"+
		"Till they had stol'n our jewel. All's but naught;\n"+
		"Patience is scottish, and impatience does\n"+
		"Become a dog that's mad: then is it sin\n"+
		"To rush into the secret house of death,\n"+
		"Ere death dare come to us? How do you, women?\n"+
		"What, what! good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian!\n"+
		"My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look,\n"+
		"Our lamp is spent, it's out! Good sirs, take heart:\n"+
		"We'll bury him; and then, what's brave,\n"+
		"what's noble,\n"+
		"Let's do it after the high Roman fashion,\n"+
		"And make death proud to take us. Come, away:\n"+
		"This case of that huge spirit now is cold:\n"+
		"Ah, women, women! come; we have no friend\n"+
		"But resolution, and the briefest end.\n"+
		"Exeunt; those above bearing off MARK ANTONY's body\n"+
		"ACT V\n"+
		"SCENE I. Alexandria. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.\n"+
		"Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, DOLABELLA, MECAENAS, GALLUS, PROCULEIUS, and others, his council of war\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Go to him, Dolabella, bid him yield;\n"+
		"Being so frustrate, tell him he mocks\n"+
		"The pauses that he makes.\n"+
		"DOLABELLA\n"+
		"Caesar, I shall.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"Enter DERCETAS, with the sword of MARK ANTONY\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Wherefore is that? and what art thou that darest\n"+
		"Appear thus to us?\n"+
		"DERCETAS\n"+
		"I am call'd Dercetas;\n"+
		"Mark Antony I served, who best was worthy\n"+
		"Best to be served: whilst he stood up and spoke,\n"+
		"He was my master; and I wore my life\n"+
		"To spend upon his haters. If thou please\n"+
		"To take me to thee, as I was to him\n"+
		"I'll be to Caesar; if thou pleasest not,\n"+
		"I yield thee up my life.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"What is't thou say'st?\n"+
		"DERCETAS\n"+
		"I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"The breaking of so great a thing should make\n"+
		"A greater crack: the round world\n"+
		"Should have shook lions into civil streets,\n"+
		"And citizens to their dens: the death of Antony\n"+
		"Is not a single doom; in the name lay\n"+
		"A moiety of the world.\n"+
		"DERCETAS\n"+
		"He is dead, Caesar:\n"+
		"Not by a public minister of justice,\n"+
		"Nor by a hired knife; but that self hand,\n"+
		"Which writ his honour in the acts it did,\n"+
		"Hath, with the courage which the heart did lend it,\n"+
		"Splitted the heart. This is his sword;\n"+
		"I robb'd his wound of it; behold it stain'd\n"+
		"With his most noble blood.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Look you sad, friends?\n"+
		"The gods rebuke me, but it is tidings\n"+
		"To wash the eyes of kings.\n"+
		"AGRIPPA\n"+
		"And strange it is,\n"+
		"That nature must compel us to lament\n"+
		"Our most persisted deeds.\n"+
		"MECAENAS\n"+
		"His taints and honours\n"+
		"Waged equal with him.\n"+
		"AGRIPPA\n"+
		"A rarer spirit never\n"+
		"Did steer humanity: but you, gods, will give us\n"+
		"Some faults to make us men. Caesar is touch'd.\n"+
		"MECAENAS\n"+
		"When such a spacious mirror's set before him,\n"+
		"He needs must see himself.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"O Antony!\n"+
		"I have follow'd thee to this; but we do lance\n"+
		"Diseases in our bodies: I must perforce\n"+
		"Have shown to thee such a declining day,\n"+
		"Or look on thine; we could not stall together\n"+
		"In the whole world: but yet let me lament,\n"+
		"With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts,\n"+
		"That thou, my brother, my competitor\n"+
		"In top of all design, my mate in empire,\n"+
		"Friend and companion in the front of war,\n"+
		"The arm of mine own body, and the heart\n"+
		"Where mine his thoughts did kindle,--that our stars,\n"+
		"Unreconciliable, should divide\n"+
		"Our equalness to this. Hear me, good friends--\n"+
		"But I will tell you at some meeter season:\n"+
		"Enter an Egyptian\n"+
		"The business of this man looks out of him;\n"+
		"We'll hear him what he says. Whence are you?\n"+
		"Egyptian\n"+
		"A poor Egyptian yet. The queen my mistress,\n"+
		"Confined in all she has, her monument,\n"+
		"Of thy intents desires instruction,\n"+
		"That she preparedly may frame herself\n"+
		"To the way she's forced to.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Bid her have good heart:\n"+
		"She soon shall know of us, by some of ours,\n"+
		"How honourable and how kindly we\n"+
		"Determine for her; for Caesar cannot live\n"+
		"To be ungentle.\n"+
		"Egyptian\n"+
		"So the gods preserve thee!\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Come hither, Proculeius. Go and say,\n"+
		"We purpose her no shame: give her what comforts\n"+
		"The quality of her passion shall require,\n"+
		"Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke\n"+
		"She do defeat us; for her life in Rome\n"+
		"Would be eternal in our triumph: go,\n"+
		"And with your speediest bring us what she says,\n"+
		"And how you find of her.\n"+
		"PROCULEIUS\n"+
		"Caesar, I shall.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Gallus, go you along.\n"+
		"Exit GALLUS\n"+
		"Where's Dolabella,\n"+
		"To second Proculeius?\n"+
		"All\n"+
		"Dolabella!\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Let him alone, for I remember now\n"+
		"How he's employ'd: he shall in time be ready.\n"+
		"Go with me to my tent; where you shall see\n"+
		"How hardly I was drawn into this war;\n"+
		"How calm and gentle I proceeded still\n"+
		"In all my writings: go with me, and see\n"+
		"What I can show in this.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. Alexandria. A room in the monument.\n"+
		"Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, and IRAS\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"My desolation does begin to make\n"+
		"A better life. 'Tis paltry to be Caesar;\n"+
		"Not being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave,\n"+
		"A minister of her will: and it is great\n"+
		"To do that thing that ends all other deeds;\n"+
		"Which shackles accidents and bolts up change;\n"+
		"Which sleeps, and never palates more the dug,\n"+
		"The beggar's nurse and Caesar's.\n"+
		"Enter, to the gates of the monument, PROCULEIUS, GALLUS and Soldiers\n"+
		"PROCULEIUS\n"+
		"Caesar sends greeting to the Queen of Egypt;\n"+
		"And bids thee study on what fair demands\n"+
		"Thou mean'st to have him grant thee.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"What's thy name?\n"+
		"PROCULEIUS\n"+
		"My name is Proculeius.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Antony\n"+
		"Did tell me of you, bade me trust you; but\n"+
		"I do not greatly care to be deceived,\n"+
		"That have no use for trusting. If your master\n"+
		"Would have a queen his beggar, you must tell him,\n"+
		"That majesty, to keep decorum, must\n"+
		"No less beg than a kingdom: if he please\n"+
		"To give me conquer'd Egypt for my son,\n"+
		"He gives me so much of mine own, as I\n"+
		"Will kneel to him with thanks.\n"+
		"PROCULEIUS\n"+
		"Be of good cheer;\n"+
		"You're fall'n into a princely hand, fear nothing:\n"+
		"Make your full reference freely to my lord,\n"+
		"Who is so full of grace, that it flows over\n"+
		"On all that need: let me report to him\n"+
		"Your sweet dependency; and you shall find\n"+
		"A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness,\n"+
		"Where he for grace is kneel'd to.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Pray you, tell him\n"+
		"I am his fortune's vassal, and I send him\n"+
		"The greatness he has got. I hourly learn\n"+
		"A doctrine of obedience; and would gladly\n"+
		"Look him i' the face.\n"+
		"PROCULEIUS\n"+
		"This I'll report, dear lady.\n"+
		"Have comfort, for I know your plight is pitied\n"+
		"Of him that caused it.\n"+
		"GALLUS\n"+
		"You see how easily she may be surprised:\n"+
		"Here PROCULEIUS and two of the Guard ascend the monument by a ladder placed against a window, and, having descended, come behind CLEOPATRA. Some of the Guard unbar and open the gates\n"+
		"To PROCULEIUS and the Guard\n"+
		"Guard her till Caesar come.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"IRAS\n"+
		"Royal queen!\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"O Cleopatra! thou art taken, queen:\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Quick, quick, good hands.\n"+
		"Drawing a dagger\n"+
		"PROCULEIUS\n"+
		"Hold, worthy lady, hold:\n"+
		"Seizes and disarms her\n"+
		"Do not yourself such wrong, who are in this\n"+
		"Relieved, but not betray'd.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"What, of death too,\n"+
		"That rids our dogs of languish?\n"+
		"PROCULEIUS\n"+
		"Cleopatra,\n"+
		"Do not abuse my master's bounty by\n"+
		"The undoing of yourself: let the world see\n"+
		"His nobleness well acted, which your death\n"+
		"Will never let come forth.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Where art thou, death?\n"+
		"Come hither, come! come, come, and take a queen\n"+
		"Worthy many babes and beggars!\n"+
		"PROCULEIUS\n"+
		"O, temperance, lady!\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Sir, I will eat no meat, I'll not drink, sir;\n"+
		"If idle talk will once be necessary,\n"+
		"I'll not sleep neither: this mortal house I'll ruin,\n"+
		"Do Caesar what he can. Know, sir, that I\n"+
		"Will not wait pinion'd at your master's court;\n"+
		"Nor once be chastised with the sober eye\n"+
		"Of dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me up\n"+
		"And show me to the shouting varletry\n"+
		"Of censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt\n"+
		"Be gentle grave unto me! rather on Nilus' mud\n"+
		"Lay me stark naked, and let the water-flies\n"+
		"Blow me into abhorring! rather make\n"+
		"My country's high pyramides my gibbet,\n"+
		"And hang me up in chains!\n"+
		"PROCULEIUS\n"+
		"You do extend\n"+
		"These thoughts of horror further than you shall\n"+
		"Find cause in Caesar.\n"+
		"Enter DOLABELLA\n"+
		"DOLABELLA\n"+
		"Proculeius,\n"+
		"What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows,\n"+
		"And he hath sent for thee: for the queen,\n"+
		"I'll take her to my guard.\n"+
		"PROCULEIUS\n"+
		"So, Dolabella,\n"+
		"It shall content me best: be gentle to her.\n"+
		"To CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"To Caesar I will speak what you shall please,\n"+
		"If you'll employ me to him.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Say, I would die.\n"+
		"Exeunt PROCULEIUS and Soldiers\n"+
		"DOLABELLA\n"+
		"Most noble empress, you have heard of me?\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"I cannot tell.\n"+
		"DOLABELLA\n"+
		"Assuredly you know me.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"No matter, sir, what I have heard or known.\n"+
		"You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams;\n"+
		"Is't not your trick?\n"+
		"DOLABELLA\n"+
		"I understand not, madam.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"I dream'd there was an Emperor Antony:\n"+
		"O, such another sleep, that I might see\n"+
		"But such another man!\n"+
		"DOLABELLA\n"+
		"If it might please ye,--\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"His face was as the heavens; and therein stuck\n"+
		"A sun and moon, which kept their course,\n"+
		"and lighted\n"+
		"The little O, the earth.\n"+
		"DOLABELLA\n"+
		"Most sovereign creature,--\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"His legs bestrid the ocean: his rear'd arm\n"+
		"Crested the world: his voice was propertied\n"+
		"As all the tuned spheres, and that to friends;\n"+
		"But when he meant to quail and shake the orb,\n"+
		"He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,\n"+
		"There was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas\n"+
		"That grew the more by reaping: his delights\n"+
		"Were dolphin-like; they show'd his back above\n"+
		"The element they lived in: in his livery\n"+
		"Walk'd crowns and crownets; realms and islands were\n"+
		"As plates dropp'd from his pocket.\n"+
		"DOLABELLA\n"+
		"Cleopatra!\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Think you there was, or might be, such a man\n"+
		"As this I dream'd of?\n"+
		"DOLABELLA\n"+
		"Gentle madam, no.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"You lie, up to the hearing of the gods.\n"+
		"But, if there be, or ever were, one such,\n"+
		"It's past the size of dreaming: nature wants stuff\n"+
		"To vie strange forms with fancy; yet, to imagine\n"+
		"And Antony, were nature's piece 'gainst fancy,\n"+
		"Condemning shadows quite.\n"+
		"DOLABELLA\n"+
		"Hear me, good madam.\n"+
		"Your loss is as yourself, great; and you bear it\n"+
		"As answering to the weight: would I might never\n"+
		"O'ertake pursued success, but I do feel,\n"+
		"By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites\n"+
		"My very heart at root.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"I thank you, sir,\n"+
		"Know you what Caesar means to do with me?\n"+
		"DOLABELLA\n"+
		"I am loath to tell you what I would you knew.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Nay, pray you, sir,--\n"+
		"DOLABELLA\n"+
		"Though he be honourable,--\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"He'll lead me, then, in triumph?\n"+
		"DOLABELLA\n"+
		"Madam, he will; I know't.\n"+
		"Flourish, and shout within, 'Make way there: Octavius Caesar!'\n"+
		"Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, GALLUS, PROCULEIUS, MECAENAS, SELEUCUS, and others of his Train\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Which is the Queen of Egypt?\n"+
		"DOLABELLA\n"+
		"It is the emperor, madam.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA kneels\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Arise, you shall not kneel:\n"+
		"I pray you, rise; rise, Egypt.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Sir, the gods\n"+
		"Will have it thus; my master and my lord\n"+
		"I must obey.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Take to you no hard thoughts:\n"+
		"The record of what injuries you did us,\n"+
		"Though written in our flesh, we shall remember\n"+
		"As things but done by chance.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Sole sir o' the world,\n"+
		"I cannot project mine own cause so well\n"+
		"To make it clear; but do confess I have\n"+
		"Been laden with like frailties which before\n"+
		"Have often shamed our sex.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Cleopatra, know,\n"+
		"We will extenuate rather than enforce:\n"+
		"If you apply yourself to our intents,\n"+
		"Which towards you are most gentle, you shall find\n"+
		"A benefit in this change; but if you seek\n"+
		"To lay on me a cruelty, by taking\n"+
		"Antony's course, you shall bereave yourself\n"+
		"Of my good purposes, and put your children\n"+
		"To that destruction which I'll guard them from,\n"+
		"If thereon you rely. I'll take my leave.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"And may, through all the world: 'tis yours; and we,\n"+
		"Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest, shall\n"+
		"Hang in what place you please. Here, my good lord.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"This is the brief of money, plate, and jewels,\n"+
		"I am possess'd of: 'tis exactly valued;\n"+
		"Not petty things admitted. Where's Seleucus?\n"+
		"SELEUCUS\n"+
		"Here, madam.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"This is my treasurer: let him speak, my lord,\n"+
		"Upon his peril, that I have reserved\n"+
		"To myself nothing. Speak the truth, Seleucus.\n"+
		"SELEUCUS\n"+
		"Madam,\n"+
		"I had rather seal my lips, than, to my peril,\n"+
		"Speak that which is not.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"What have I kept back?\n"+
		"SELEUCUS\n"+
		"Enough to purchase what you have made known.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve\n"+
		"Your wisdom in the deed.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"See, Caesar! O, behold,\n"+
		"How pomp is follow'd! mine will now be yours;\n"+
		"And, should we shift estates, yours would be mine.\n"+
		"The ingratitude of this Seleucus does\n"+
		"Even make me wild: O slave, of no more trust\n"+
		"Than love that's hired! What, goest thou back? thou shalt\n"+
		"Go back, I warrant thee; but I'll catch thine eyes,\n"+
		"Though they had wings: slave, soulless villain, dog!\n"+
		"O rarely base!\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Good queen, let us entreat you.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"O Caesar, what a wounding shame is this,\n"+
		"That thou, vouchsafing here to visit me,\n"+
		"Doing the honour of thy lordliness\n"+
		"To one so meek, that mine own servant should\n"+
		"Parcel the sum of my disgraces by\n"+
		"Addition of his envy! Say, good Caesar,\n"+
		"That I some lady trifles have reserved,\n"+
		"Immoment toys, things of such dignity\n"+
		"As we greet modern friends withal; and say,\n"+
		"Some nobler token I have kept apart\n"+
		"For Livia and Octavia, to induce\n"+
		"Their mediation; must I be unfolded\n"+
		"With one that I have bred? The gods! it smites me\n"+
		"Beneath the fall I have.\n"+
		"To SELEUCUS\n"+
		"Prithee, go hence;\n"+
		"Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits\n"+
		"Through the ashes of my chance: wert thou a man,\n"+
		"Thou wouldst have mercy on me.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Forbear, Seleucus.\n"+
		"Exit SELEUCUS\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Be it known, that we, the greatest, are misthought\n"+
		"For things that others do; and, when we fall,\n"+
		"We answer others' merits in our name,\n"+
		"Are therefore to be pitied.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Cleopatra,\n"+
		"Not what you have reserved, nor what acknowledged,\n"+
		"Put we i' the roll of conquest: still be't yours,\n"+
		"Bestow it at your pleasure; and believe,\n"+
		"Caesar's no merchant, to make prize with you\n"+
		"Of things that merchants sold. Therefore be cheer'd;\n"+
		"Make not your thoughts your prisons: no, dear queen;\n"+
		"For we intend so to dispose you as\n"+
		"Yourself shall give us counsel. Feed, and sleep:\n"+
		"Our care and pity is so much upon you,\n"+
		"That we remain your friend; and so, adieu.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"My master, and my lord!\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Not so. Adieu.\n"+
		"Flourish. Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR and his train\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"He words me, girls, he words me, that I should not\n"+
		"Be noble to myself: but, hark thee, Charmian.\n"+
		"Whispers CHARMIAN\n"+
		"IRAS\n"+
		"Finish, good lady; the bright day is done,\n"+
		"And we are for the dark.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Hie thee again:\n"+
		"I have spoke already, and it is provided;\n"+
		"Go put it to the haste.\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"Madam, I will.\n"+
		"Re-enter DOLABELLA\n"+
		"DOLABELLA\n"+
		"Where is the queen?\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"Behold, sir.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Dolabella!\n"+
		"DOLABELLA\n"+
		"Madam, as thereto sworn by your command,\n"+
		"Which my love makes religion to obey,\n"+
		"I tell you this: Caesar through Syria\n"+
		"Intends his journey; and within three days\n"+
		"You with your children will he send before:\n"+
		"Make your best use of this: I have perform'd\n"+
		"Your pleasure and my promise.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Dolabella,\n"+
		"I shall remain your debtor.\n"+
		"DOLABELLA\n"+
		"I your servant,\n"+
		"Adieu, good queen; I must attend on Caesar.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Farewell, and thanks.\n"+
		"Exit DOLABELLA\n"+
		"Now, Iras, what think'st thou?\n"+
		"Thou, an Egyptian puppet, shalt be shown\n"+
		"In Rome, as well as I mechanic slaves\n"+
		"With greasy aprons, rules, and hammers, shall\n"+
		"Uplift us to the view; in their thick breaths,\n"+
		"Rank of gross diet, shall be enclouded,\n"+
		"And forced to drink their vapour.\n"+
		"IRAS\n"+
		"The gods forbid!\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Nay, 'tis most certain, Iras: saucy lictors\n"+
		"Will catch at us, like strumpets; and scald rhymers\n"+
		"Ballad us out o' tune: the quick comedians\n"+
		"Extemporally will stage us, and present\n"+
		"Our Alexandrian revels; Antony\n"+
		"Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see\n"+
		"Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness\n"+
		"I' the posture of a whore.\n"+
		"IRAS\n"+
		"O the good gods!\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Nay, that's certain.\n"+
		"IRAS\n"+
		"I'll never see 't; for, I am sure, my nails\n"+
		"Are stronger than mine eyes.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Why, that's the way\n"+
		"To fool their preparation, and to conquer\n"+
		"Their most absurd intents.\n"+
		"Re-enter CHARMIAN\n"+
		"Now, Charmian!\n"+
		"Show me, my women, like a queen: go fetch\n"+
		"My best attires: I am again for Cydnus,\n"+
		"To meet Mark Antony: sirrah Iras, go.\n"+
		"Now, noble Charmian, we'll dispatch indeed;\n"+
		"And, when thou hast done this chare, I'll give thee leave\n"+
		"To play till doomsday. Bring our crown and all.\n"+
		"Wherefore's this noise?\n"+
		"Exit IRAS. A noise within\n"+
		"Enter a Guardsman\n"+
		"Guard\n"+
		"Here is a rural fellow\n"+
		"That will not be denied your highness presence:\n"+
		"He brings you figs.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Let him come in.\n"+
		"Exit Guardsman\n"+
		"What poor an instrument\n"+
		"May do a noble deed! he brings me liberty.\n"+
		"My resolution's placed, and I have nothing\n"+
		"Of woman in me: now from head to foot\n"+
		"I am marble-constant; now the fleeting moon\n"+
		"No planet is of mine.\n"+
		"Re-enter Guardsman, with Clown bringing in a basket\n"+
		"Guard\n"+
		"This is the man.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Avoid, and leave him.\n"+
		"Exit Guardsman\n"+
		"Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there,\n"+
		"That kills and pains not?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Truly, I have him: but I would not be the party\n"+
		"that should desire you to touch him, for his biting\n"+
		"is immortal; those that do die of it do seldom or\n"+
		"never recover.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Rememberest thou any that have died on't?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Very many, men and women too. I heard of one of\n"+
		"them no longer than yesterday: a very honest woman,\n"+
		"but something given to lie; as a woman should not\n"+
		"do, but in the way of honesty: how she died of the\n"+
		"biting of it, what pain she felt: truly, she makes\n"+
		"a very good report o' the worm; but he that will\n"+
		"believe all that they say, shall never be saved by\n"+
		"half that they do: but this is most fallible, the\n"+
		"worm's an odd worm.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Get thee hence; farewell.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"I wish you all joy of the worm.\n"+
		"Setting down his basket\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Farewell.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"You must think this, look you, that the worm will\n"+
		"do his kind.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Ay, ay; farewell.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Look you, the worm is not to be trusted but in the\n"+
		"keeping of wise people; for, indeed, there is no\n"+
		"goodness in worm.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Take thou no care; it shall be heeded.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Very good. Give it nothing, I pray you, for it is\n"+
		"not worth the feeding.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Will it eat me?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"You must not think I am so simple but I know the\n"+
		"devil himself will not eat a woman: I know that a\n"+
		"woman is a dish for the gods, if the devil dress her\n"+
		"not. But, truly, these same whoreson devils do the\n"+
		"gods great harm in their women; for in every ten\n"+
		"that they make, the devils mar five.\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Well, get thee gone; farewell.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Yes, forsooth: I wish you joy o' the worm.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"Re-enter IRAS with a robe, crown, & c\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Give me my robe, put on my crown; I have\n"+
		"Immortal longings in me: now no more\n"+
		"The juice of Egypt's grape shall moist this lip:\n"+
		"Yare, yare, good Iras; quick. Methinks I hear\n"+
		"Antony call; I see him rouse himself\n"+
		"To praise my noble act; I hear him mock\n"+
		"The luck of Caesar, which the gods give men\n"+
		"To excuse their after wrath: husband, I come:\n"+
		"Now to that name my courage prove my title!\n"+
		"I am fire and air; my other elements\n"+
		"I give to baser life. So; have you done?\n"+
		"Come then, and take the last warmth of my lips.\n"+
		"Farewell, kind Charmian; Iras, long farewell.\n"+
		"Kisses them. IRAS falls and dies\n"+
		"Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall?\n"+
		"If thou and nature can so gently part,\n"+
		"The stroke of death is as a lover's pinch,\n"+
		"Which hurts, and is desired. Dost thou lie still?\n"+
		"If thus thou vanishest, thou tell'st the world\n"+
		"It is not worth leave-taking.\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"Dissolve, thick cloud, and rain; that I may say,\n"+
		"The gods themselves do weep!\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"This proves me base:\n"+
		"If she first meet the curled Antony,\n"+
		"He'll make demand of her, and spend that kiss\n"+
		"Which is my heaven to have. Come, thou\n"+
		"mortal wretch,\n"+
		"To an asp, which she applies to her breast\n"+
		"With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate\n"+
		"Of life at once untie: poor venomous fool\n"+
		"Be angry, and dispatch. O, couldst thou speak,\n"+
		"That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass\n"+
		"Unpolicied!\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"O eastern star!\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"Peace, peace!\n"+
		"Dost thou not see my baby at my breast,\n"+
		"That sucks the nurse asleep?\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"O, break! O, break!\n"+
		"CLEOPATRA\n"+
		"As sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle,--\n"+
		"O Antony!--Nay, I will take thee too.\n"+
		"Applying another asp to her arm\n"+
		"What should I stay--\n"+
		"Dies\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"In this vile world? So, fare thee well.\n"+
		"Now boast thee, death, in thy possession lies\n"+
		"A lass unparallel'd. Downy windows, close;\n"+
		"And golden Phoebus never be beheld\n"+
		"Of eyes again so royal! Your crown's awry;\n"+
		"I'll mend it, and then play.\n"+
		"Enter the Guard, rushing in\n"+
		"First Guard\n"+
		"Where is the queen?\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"Speak softly, wake her not.\n"+
		"First Guard\n"+
		"Caesar hath sent--\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"Too slow a messenger.\n"+
		"Applies an asp\n"+
		"O, come apace, dispatch! I partly feel thee.\n"+
		"First Guard\n"+
		"Approach, ho! All's not well: Caesar's beguiled.\n"+
		"Second Guard\n"+
		"There's Dolabella sent from Caesar; call him.\n"+
		"First Guard\n"+
		"What work is here! Charmian, is this well done?\n"+
		"CHARMIAN\n"+
		"It is well done, and fitting for a princess\n"+
		"Descended of so many royal kings.\n"+
		"Ah, soldier!\n"+
		"Dies\n"+
		"Re-enter DOLABELLA\n"+
		"DOLABELLA\n"+
		"How goes it here?\n"+
		"Second Guard\n"+
		"All dead.\n"+
		"DOLABELLA\n"+
		"Caesar, thy thoughts\n"+
		"Touch their effects in this: thyself art coming\n"+
		"To see perform'd the dreaded act which thou\n"+
		"So sought'st to hinder.\n"+
		"Within 'A way there, a way for Caesar!'\n"+
		"Re-enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR and all his train marching\n"+
		"DOLABELLA\n"+
		"O sir, you are too sure an augurer;\n"+
		"That you did fear is done.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Bravest at the last,\n"+
		"She levell'd at our purposes, and, being royal,\n"+
		"Took her own way. The manner of their deaths?\n"+
		"I do not see them bleed.\n"+
		"DOLABELLA\n"+
		"Who was last with them?\n"+
		"First Guard\n"+
		"A simple countryman, that brought her figs:\n"+
		"This was his basket.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Poison'd, then.\n"+
		"First Guard\n"+
		"O Caesar,\n"+
		"This Charmian lived but now; she stood and spake:\n"+
		"I found her trimming up the diadem\n"+
		"On her dead mistress; tremblingly she stood\n"+
		"And on the sudden dropp'd.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"O noble weakness!\n"+
		"If they had swallow'd poison, 'twould appear\n"+
		"By external swelling: but she looks like sleep,\n"+
		"As she would catch another Antony\n"+
		"In her strong toil of grace.\n"+
		"DOLABELLA\n"+
		"Here, on her breast,\n"+
		"There is a vent of blood and something blown:\n"+
		"The like is on her arm.\n"+
		"First Guard\n"+
		"This is an aspic's trail: and these fig-leaves\n"+
		"Have slime upon them, such as the aspic leaves\n"+
		"Upon the caves of Nile.\n"+
		"OCTAVIUS CAESAR\n"+
		"Most probable\n"+
		"That so she died; for her physician tells me\n"+
		"She hath pursued conclusions infinite\n"+
		"Of easy ways to die. Take up her bed;\n"+
		"And bear her women from the monument:\n"+
		"She shall be buried by her Antony:\n"+
		"No grave upon the earth shall clip in it\n"+
		"A pair so famous. High events as these\n"+
		"Strike those that make them; and their story is\n"+
		"No less in pity than his glory which\n"+
		"Brought them to be lamented. Our army shall\n"+
		"In solemn show attend this funeral;\n"+
		"And then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, see\n"+
		"High order in this great solemnity.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"
