		"The Comedy of Errors\n"+
		"ACT I\n"+
		"SCENE I. A hall in DUKE SOLINUS'S palace.\n"+
		"Enter DUKE SOLINUS, AEGEON, Gaoler, Officers, and other Attendants\n"+
		"AEGEON\n"+
		"Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall\n"+
		"And by the doom of death end woes and all.\n"+
		"DUKE SOLINUS\n"+
		"Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more;\n"+
		"I am not partial to infringe our laws:\n"+
		"The enmity and discord which of late\n"+
		"Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke\n"+
		"To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,\n"+
		"Who wanting guilders to redeem their lives\n"+
		"Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods,\n"+
		"Excludes all pity from our threatening looks.\n"+
		"For, since the mortal and intestine jars\n"+
		"'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,\n"+
		"It hath in solemn synods been decreed\n"+
		"Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,\n"+
		"To admit no traffic to our adverse towns Nay, more,\n"+
		"If any born at Ephesus be seen\n"+
		"At any Syracusian marts and fairs;\n"+
		"Again: if any Syracusian born\n"+
		"Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,\n"+
		"His goods confiscate to the duke's dispose,\n"+
		"Unless a thousand marks be levied,\n"+
		"To quit the penalty and to ransom him.\n"+
		"Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,\n"+
		"Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;\n"+
		"Therefore by law thou art condemned to die.\n"+
		"AEGEON\n"+
		"Yet this my comfort: when your words are done,\n"+
		"My woes end likewise with the evening sun.\n"+
		"DUKE SOLINUS\n"+
		"Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause\n"+
		"Why thou departed'st from thy native home\n"+
		"And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus.\n"+
		"AEGEON\n"+
		"A heavier task could not have been imposed\n"+
		"Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable:\n"+
		"Yet, that the world may witness that my end\n"+
		"Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,\n"+
		"I'll utter what my sorrows give me leave.\n"+
		"In Syracusa was I born, and wed\n"+
		"Unto a woman, happy but for me,\n"+
		"And by me, had not our hap been bad.\n"+
		"With her I lived in joy; our wealth increased\n"+
		"By prosperous voyages I often made\n"+
		"To Epidamnum; till my factor's death\n"+
		"And the great care of goods at random left\n"+
		"Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:\n"+
		"From whom my absence was not six months old\n"+
		"Before herself, almost at fainting under\n"+
		"The pleasing punishment that women bear,\n"+
		"Had made provision for her following me\n"+
		"And soon and safe arrived where I was.\n"+
		"There had she not been long, but she became\n"+
		"A joyful mother of two goodly sons;\n"+
		"And, which was strange, the one so like the other,\n"+
		"As could not be distinguish'd but by names.\n"+
		"That very hour, and in the self-same inn,\n"+
		"A meaner woman was delivered\n"+
		"Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:\n"+
		"Those,--for their parents were exceeding poor,--\n"+
		"I bought and brought up to attend my sons.\n"+
		"My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,\n"+
		"Made daily motions for our home return:\n"+
		"Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon,\n"+
		"We came aboard.\n"+
		"A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd,\n"+
		"Before the always wind-obeying deep\n"+
		"Gave any tragic instance of our harm:\n"+
		"But longer did we not retain much hope;\n"+
		"For what obscured light the heavens did grant\n"+
		"Did but convey unto our fearful minds\n"+
		"A doubtful warrant of immediate death;\n"+
		"Which though myself would gladly have embraced,\n"+
		"Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,\n"+
		"Weeping before for what she saw must come,\n"+
		"And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,\n"+
		"That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,\n"+
		"Forced me to seek delays for them and me.\n"+
		"And this it was, for other means was none:\n"+
		"The sailors sought for safety by our boat,\n"+
		"And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us:\n"+
		"My wife, more careful for the latter-born,\n"+
		"Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast,\n"+
		"Such as seafaring men provide for storms;\n"+
		"To him one of the other twins was bound,\n"+
		"Whilst I had been like heedful of the other:\n"+
		"The children thus disposed, my wife and I,\n"+
		"Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,\n"+
		"Fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast;\n"+
		"And floating straight, obedient to the stream,\n"+
		"Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.\n"+
		"At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,\n"+
		"Dispersed those vapours that offended us;\n"+
		"And by the benefit of his wished light,\n"+
		"The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered\n"+
		"Two ships from far making amain to us,\n"+
		"Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this:\n"+
		"But ere they came,--O, let me say no more!\n"+
		"Gather the sequel by that went before.\n"+
		"DUKE SOLINUS\n"+
		"Nay, forward, old man; do not break off so;\n"+
		"For we may pity, though not pardon thee.\n"+
		"AEGEON\n"+
		"O, had the gods done so, I had not now\n"+
		"Worthily term'd them merciless to us!\n"+
		"For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,\n"+
		"We were encounterd by a mighty rock;\n"+
		"Which being violently borne upon,\n"+
		"Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;\n"+
		"So that, in this unjust divorce of us,\n"+
		"Fortune had left to both of us alike\n"+
		"What to delight in, what to sorrow for.\n"+
		"Her part, poor soul! seeming as burdened\n"+
		"With lesser weight but not with lesser woe,\n"+
		"Was carried with more speed before the wind;\n"+
		"And in our sight they three were taken up\n"+
		"By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.\n"+
		"At length, another ship had seized on us;\n"+
		"And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,\n"+
		"Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests;\n"+
		"And would have reft the fishers of their prey,\n"+
		"Had not their bark been very slow of sail;\n"+
		"And therefore homeward did they bend their course.\n"+
		"Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss;\n"+
		"That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd,\n"+
		"To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.\n"+
		"DUKE SOLINUS\n"+
		"And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,\n"+
		"Do me the favour to dilate at full\n"+
		"What hath befall'n of them and thee till now.\n"+
		"AEGEON\n"+
		"My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,\n"+
		"At eighteen years became inquisitive\n"+
		"After his brother: and importuned me\n"+
		"That his attendant--so his case was like,\n"+
		"Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--\n"+
		"Might bear him company in the quest of him:\n"+
		"Whom whilst I labour'd of a love to see,\n"+
		"I hazarded the loss of whom I loved.\n"+
		"Five summers have I spent in furthest Greece,\n"+
		"Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,\n"+
		"And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;\n"+
		"Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought\n"+
		"Or that or any place that harbours men.\n"+
		"But here must end the story of my life;\n"+
		"And happy were I in my timely death,\n"+
		"Could all my travels warrant me they live.\n"+
		"DUKE SOLINUS\n"+
		"Hapless AEgeon, whom the fates have mark'd\n"+
		"To bear the extremity of dire mishap!\n"+
		"Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,\n"+
		"Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,\n"+
		"Which princes, would they, may not disannul,\n"+
		"My soul would sue as advocate for thee.\n"+
		"But, though thou art adjudged to the death\n"+
		"And passed sentence may not be recall'd\n"+
		"But to our honour's great disparagement,\n"+
		"Yet I will favour thee in what I can.\n"+
		"Therefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this day\n"+
		"To seek thy life by beneficial help:\n"+
		"Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;\n"+
		"Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,\n"+
		"And live; if no, then thou art doom'd to die.\n"+
		"Gaoler, take him to thy custody.\n"+
		"Gaoler\n"+
		"I will, my lord.\n"+
		"AEGEON\n"+
		"Hopeless and helpless doth AEgeon wend,\n"+
		"But to procrastinate his lifeless end.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. The Mart.\n"+
		"Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse, DROMIO of Syracuse, and First Merchant\n"+
		"First Merchant\n"+
		"Therefore give out you are of Epidamnum,\n"+
		"Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate.\n"+
		"This very day a Syracusian merchant\n"+
		"Is apprehended for arrival here;\n"+
		"And not being able to buy out his life\n"+
		"According to the statute of the town,\n"+
		"Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.\n"+
		"There is your money that I had to keep.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host,\n"+
		"And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.\n"+
		"Within this hour it will be dinner-time:\n"+
		"Till that, I'll view the manners of the town,\n"+
		"Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,\n"+
		"And then return and sleep within mine inn,\n"+
		"For with long travel I am stiff and weary.\n"+
		"Get thee away.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Many a man would take you at your word,\n"+
		"And go indeed, having so good a mean.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,\n"+
		"When I am dull with care and melancholy,\n"+
		"Lightens my humour with his merry jests.\n"+
		"What, will you walk with me about the town,\n"+
		"And then go to my inn and dine with me?\n"+
		"First Merchant\n"+
		"I am invited, sir, to certain merchants,\n"+
		"Of whom I hope to make much benefit;\n"+
		"I crave your pardon. Soon at five o'clock,\n"+
		"Please you, I'll meet with you upon the mart\n"+
		"And afterward consort you till bed-time:\n"+
		"My present business calls me from you now.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Farewell till then: I will go lose myself\n"+
		"And wander up and down to view the city.\n"+
		"First Merchant\n"+
		"Sir, I commend you to your own content.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"He that commends me to mine own content\n"+
		"Commends me to the thing I cannot get.\n"+
		"I to the world am like a drop of water\n"+
		"That in the ocean seeks another drop,\n"+
		"Who, falling there to find his fellow forth,\n"+
		"Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself:\n"+
		"So I, to find a mother and a brother,\n"+
		"In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.\n"+
		"Enter DROMIO of Ephesus\n"+
		"Here comes the almanac of my true date.\n"+
		"What now? how chance thou art return'd so soon?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:\n"+
		"The capon burns, the pig falls from the spit,\n"+
		"The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell;\n"+
		"My mistress made it one upon my cheek:\n"+
		"She is so hot because the meat is cold;\n"+
		"The meat is cold because you come not home;\n"+
		"You come not home because you have no stomach;\n"+
		"You have no stomach having broke your fast;\n"+
		"But we that know what 'tis to fast and pray\n"+
		"Are penitent for your default to-day.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Stop in your wind, sir: tell me this, I pray:\n"+
		"Where have you left the money that I gave you?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"O,--sixpence, that I had o' Wednesday last\n"+
		"To pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper?\n"+
		"The saddler had it, sir; I kept it not.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"I am not in a sportive humour now:\n"+
		"Tell me, and dally not, where is the money?\n"+
		"We being strangers here, how darest thou trust\n"+
		"So great a charge from thine own custody?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"I pray you, air, as you sit at dinner:\n"+
		"I from my mistress come to you in post;\n"+
		"If I return, I shall be post indeed,\n"+
		"For she will score your fault upon my pate.\n"+
		"Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,\n"+
		"And strike you home without a messenger.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season;\n"+
		"Reserve them till a merrier hour than this.\n"+
		"Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"To me, sir? why, you gave no gold to me.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,\n"+
		"And tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"My charge was but to fetch you from the mart\n"+
		"Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner:\n"+
		"My mistress and her sister stays for you.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"In what safe place you have bestow'd my money,\n"+
		"Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours\n"+
		"That stands on tricks when I am undisposed:\n"+
		"Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"I have some marks of yours upon my pate,\n"+
		"Some of my mistress' marks upon my shoulders,\n"+
		"But not a thousand marks between you both.\n"+
		"If I should pay your worship those again,\n"+
		"Perchance you will not bear them patiently.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Thy mistress' marks? what mistress, slave, hast thou?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Your worship's wife, my mistress at the Phoenix;\n"+
		"She that doth fast till you come home to dinner,\n"+
		"And prays that you will hie you home to dinner.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,\n"+
		"Being forbid? There, take you that, sir knave.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"What mean you, sir? for God's sake, hold your hands!\n"+
		"Nay, and you will not, sir, I'll take my heels.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Upon my life, by some device or other\n"+
		"The villain is o'er-raught of all my money.\n"+
		"They say this town is full of cozenage,\n"+
		"As, nimble jugglers that deceive the eye,\n"+
		"Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind,\n"+
		"Soul-killing witches that deform the body,\n"+
		"Disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks,\n"+
		"And many such-like liberties of sin:\n"+
		"If it prove so, I will be gone the sooner.\n"+
		"I'll to the Centaur, to go seek this slave:\n"+
		"I greatly fear my money is not safe.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"ACT II\n"+
		"SCENE I. The house of ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus.\n"+
		"Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"Neither my husband nor the slave return'd,\n"+
		"That in such haste I sent to seek his master!\n"+
		"Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.\n"+
		"LUCIANA\n"+
		"Perhaps some merchant hath invited him,\n"+
		"And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner.\n"+
		"Good sister, let us dine and never fret:\n"+
		"A man is master of his liberty:\n"+
		"Time is their master, and, when they see time,\n"+
		"They'll go or come: if so, be patient, sister.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"Why should their liberty than ours be more?\n"+
		"LUCIANA\n"+
		"Because their business still lies out o' door.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"Look, when I serve him so, he takes it ill.\n"+
		"LUCIANA\n"+
		"O, know he is the bridle of your will.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"There's none but asses will be bridled so.\n"+
		"LUCIANA\n"+
		"Why, headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe.\n"+
		"There's nothing situate under heaven's eye\n"+
		"But hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky:\n"+
		"The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls,\n"+
		"Are their males' subjects and at their controls:\n"+
		"Men, more divine, the masters of all these,\n"+
		"Lords of the wide world and wild watery seas,\n"+
		"Indued with intellectual sense and souls,\n"+
		"Of more preeminence than fish and fowls,\n"+
		"Are masters to their females, and their lords:\n"+
		"Then let your will attend on their accords.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"This servitude makes you to keep unwed.\n"+
		"LUCIANA\n"+
		"Not this, but troubles of the marriage-bed.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.\n"+
		"LUCIANA\n"+
		"Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"How if your husband start some other where?\n"+
		"LUCIANA\n"+
		"Till he come home again, I would forbear.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"Patience unmoved! no marvel though she pause;\n"+
		"They can be meek that have no other cause.\n"+
		"A wretched soul, bruised with adversity,\n"+
		"We bid be quiet when we hear it cry;\n"+
		"But were we burdened with like weight of pain,\n"+
		"As much or more would we ourselves complain:\n"+
		"So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,\n"+
		"With urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me,\n"+
		"But, if thou live to see like right bereft,\n"+
		"This fool-begg'd patience in thee will be left.\n"+
		"LUCIANA\n"+
		"Well, I will marry one day, but to try.\n"+
		"Here comes your man; now is your husband nigh.\n"+
		"Enter DROMIO of Ephesus\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"Say, is your tardy master now at hand?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Nay, he's at two hands with me, and that my two ears\n"+
		"can witness.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"Say, didst thou speak with him? know'st thou his mind?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear:\n"+
		"Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it.\n"+
		"LUCIANA\n"+
		"Spake he so doubtfully, thou couldst not feel his meaning?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Nay, he struck so plainly, I could too well feel his\n"+
		"blows; and withal so doubtfully that I could scarce\n"+
		"understand them.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"But say, I prithee, is he coming home? It seems he\n"+
		"hath great care to please his wife.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Why, mistress, sure my master is horn-mad.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"Horn-mad, thou villain!\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"I mean not cuckold-mad;\n"+
		"But, sure, he is stark mad.\n"+
		"When I desired him to come home to dinner,\n"+
		"He ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold:\n"+
		"''Tis dinner-time,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he;\n"+
		"'Your meat doth burn,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he:\n"+
		"'Will you come home?' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he.\n"+
		"'Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?'\n"+
		"'The pig,' quoth I, 'is burn'd;' 'My gold!' quoth he:\n"+
		"'My mistress, sir' quoth I; 'Hang up thy mistress!\n"+
		"I know not thy mistress; out on thy mistress!'\n"+
		"LUCIANA\n"+
		"Quoth who?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Quoth my master:\n"+
		"'I know,' quoth he, 'no house, no wife, no mistress.'\n"+
		"So that my errand, due unto my tongue,\n"+
		"I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders;\n"+
		"For, in conclusion, he did beat me there.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Go back again, and be new beaten home?\n"+
		"For God's sake, send some other messenger.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"And he will bless that cross with other beating:\n"+
		"Between you I shall have a holy head.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"Hence, prating peasant! fetch thy master home.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Am I so round with you as you with me,\n"+
		"That like a football you do spurn me thus?\n"+
		"You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither:\n"+
		"If I last in this service, you must case me in leather.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"LUCIANA\n"+
		"Fie, how impatience loureth in your face!\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"His company must do his minions grace,\n"+
		"Whilst I at home starve for a merry look.\n"+
		"Hath homely age the alluring beauty took\n"+
		"From my poor cheek? then he hath wasted it:\n"+
		"Are my discourses dull? barren my wit?\n"+
		"If voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd,\n"+
		"Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard:\n"+
		"Do their gay vestments his affections bait?\n"+
		"That's not my fault: he's master of my state:\n"+
		"What ruins are in me that can be found,\n"+
		"By him not ruin'd? then is he the ground\n"+
		"Of my defeatures. My decayed fair\n"+
		"A sunny look of his would soon repair\n"+
		"But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale\n"+
		"And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.\n"+
		"LUCIANA\n"+
		"Self-harming jealousy! fie, beat it hence!\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.\n"+
		"I know his eye doth homage otherwhere,\n"+
		"Or else what lets it but he would be here?\n"+
		"Sister, you know he promised me a chain;\n"+
		"Would that alone, alone he would detain,\n"+
		"So he would keep fair quarter with his bed!\n"+
		"I see the jewel best enamelled\n"+
		"Will lose his beauty; yet the gold bides still,\n"+
		"That others touch, and often touching will\n"+
		"Wear gold: and no man that hath a name,\n"+
		"By falsehood and corruption doth it shame.\n"+
		"Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,\n"+
		"I'll weep what's left away, and weeping die.\n"+
		"LUCIANA\n"+
		"How many fond fools serve mad jealousy!\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. A public place.\n"+
		"Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up\n"+
		"Safe at the Centaur; and the heedful slave\n"+
		"Is wander'd forth, in care to seek me out\n"+
		"By computation and mine host's report.\n"+
		"I could not speak with Dromio since at first\n"+
		"I sent him from the mart. See, here he comes.\n"+
		"Enter DROMIO of Syracuse\n"+
		"How now sir! is your merry humour alter'd?\n"+
		"As you love strokes, so jest with me again.\n"+
		"You know no Centaur? you received no gold?\n"+
		"Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner?\n"+
		"My house was at the Phoenix? Wast thou mad,\n"+
		"That thus so madly thou didst answer me?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"What answer, sir? when spake I such a word?\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Even now, even here, not half an hour since.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"I did not see you since you sent me hence,\n"+
		"Home to the Centaur, with the gold you gave me.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,\n"+
		"And told'st me of a mistress and a dinner;\n"+
		"For which, I hope, thou felt'st I was displeased.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"I am glad to see you in this merry vein:\n"+
		"What means this jest? I pray you, master, tell me.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth?\n"+
		"Think'st thou I jest? Hold, take thou that, and that.\n"+
		"Beating him\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Hold, sir, for God's sake! now your jest is earnest:\n"+
		"Upon what bargain do you give it me?\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Because that I familiarly sometimes\n"+
		"Do use you for my fool and chat with you,\n"+
		"Your sauciness will jest upon my love\n"+
		"And make a common of my serious hours.\n"+
		"When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport,\n"+
		"But creep in crannies when he hides his beams.\n"+
		"If you will jest with me, know my aspect,\n"+
		"And fashion your demeanor to my looks,\n"+
		"Or I will beat this method in your sconce.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Sconce call you it? so you would leave battering, I\n"+
		"had rather have it a head: an you use these blows\n"+
		"long, I must get a sconce for my head and ensconce\n"+
		"it too; or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders.\n"+
		"But, I pray, sir why am I beaten?\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Dost thou not know?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Nothing, sir, but that I am beaten.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Shall I tell you why?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Ay, sir, and wherefore; for they say every why hath\n"+
		"a wherefore.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Why, first,--for flouting me; and then, wherefore--\n"+
		"For urging it the second time to me.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season,\n"+
		"When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme\n"+
		"nor reason?\n"+
		"Well, sir, I thank you.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Thank me, sir, for what?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Marry, sir, for this something that you gave me for nothing.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"I'll make you amends next, to give you nothing for\n"+
		"something. But say, sir, is it dinner-time?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"No, sir; I think the meat wants that I have.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"In good time, sir; what's that?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Basting.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Well, sir, then 'twill be dry.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"If it be, sir, I pray you, eat none of it.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Your reason?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Lest it make you choleric and purchase me another\n"+
		"dry basting.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Well, sir, learn to jest in good time: there's a\n"+
		"time for all things.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"I durst have denied that, before you were so choleric.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"By what rule, sir?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the plain bald\n"+
		"pate of father Time himself.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Let's hear it.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"There's no time for a man to recover his hair that\n"+
		"grows bald by nature.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"May he not do it by fine and recovery?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig and recover the\n"+
		"lost hair of another man.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Why is Time such a niggard of hair, being, as it is,\n"+
		"so plentiful an excrement?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts;\n"+
		"and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Why, but there's many a man hath more hair than wit.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"The plainer dealer, the sooner lost: yet he loseth\n"+
		"it in a kind of jollity.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"For what reason?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"For two; and sound ones too.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Nay, not sound, I pray you.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Sure ones, then.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Certain ones then.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Name them.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"The one, to save the money that he spends in\n"+
		"trimming; the other, that at dinner they should not\n"+
		"drop in his porridge.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"You would all this time have proved there is no\n"+
		"time for all things.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Marry, and did, sir; namely, no time to recover hair\n"+
		"lost by nature.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"But your reason was not substantial, why there is no\n"+
		"time to recover.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald and therefore\n"+
		"to the world's end will have bald followers.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"I knew 'twould be a bald conclusion:\n"+
		"But, soft! who wafts us yonder?\n"+
		"Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown:\n"+
		"Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects;\n"+
		"I am not Adriana nor thy wife.\n"+
		"The time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow\n"+
		"That never words were music to thine ear,\n"+
		"That never object pleasing in thine eye,\n"+
		"That never touch well welcome to thy hand,\n"+
		"That never meat sweet-savor'd in thy taste,\n"+
		"Unless I spake, or look'd, or touch'd, or carved to thee.\n"+
		"How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it,\n"+
		"That thou art thus estranged from thyself?\n"+
		"Thyself I call it, being strange to me,\n"+
		"That, undividable, incorporate,\n"+
		"Am better than thy dear self's better part.\n"+
		"Ah, do not tear away thyself from me!\n"+
		"For know, my love, as easy mayest thou fall\n"+
		"A drop of water in the breaking gulf,\n"+
		"And take unmingled that same drop again,\n"+
		"Without addition or diminishing,\n"+
		"As take from me thyself and not me too.\n"+
		"How dearly would it touch me to the quick,\n"+
		"Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious\n"+
		"And that this body, consecrate to thee,\n"+
		"By ruffian lust should be contaminate!\n"+
		"Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me\n"+
		"And hurl the name of husband in my face\n"+
		"And tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow\n"+
		"And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring\n"+
		"And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?\n"+
		"I know thou canst; and therefore see thou do it.\n"+
		"I am possess'd with an adulterate blot;\n"+
		"My blood is mingled with the crime of lust:\n"+
		"For if we too be one and thou play false,\n"+
		"I do digest the poison of thy flesh,\n"+
		"Being strumpeted by thy contagion.\n"+
		"Keep then far league and truce with thy true bed;\n"+
		"I live unstain'd, thou undishonoured.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not:\n"+
		"In Ephesus I am but two hours old,\n"+
		"As strange unto your town as to your talk;\n"+
		"Who, every word by all my wit being scann'd,\n"+
		"Want wit in all one word to understand.\n"+
		"LUCIANA\n"+
		"Fie, brother! how the world is changed with you!\n"+
		"When were you wont to use my sister thus?\n"+
		"She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"By Dromio?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"By me?\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"By thee; and this thou didst return from him,\n"+
		"That he did buffet thee, and, in his blows,\n"+
		"Denied my house for his, me for his wife.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman?\n"+
		"What is the course and drift of your compact?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"I, sir? I never saw her till this time.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Villain, thou liest; for even her very words\n"+
		"Didst thou deliver to me on the mart.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"I never spake with her in all my life.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"How can she thus then call us by our names,\n"+
		"Unless it be by inspiration.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"How ill agrees it with your gravity\n"+
		"To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave,\n"+
		"Abetting him to thwart me in my mood!\n"+
		"Be it my wrong you are from me exempt,\n"+
		"But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt.\n"+
		"Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine:\n"+
		"Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine,\n"+
		"Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state,\n"+
		"Makes me with thy strength to communicate:\n"+
		"If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,\n"+
		"Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss;\n"+
		"Who, all for want of pruning, with intrusion\n"+
		"Infect thy sap and live on thy confusion.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme:\n"+
		"What, was I married to her in my dream?\n"+
		"Or sleep I now and think I hear all this?\n"+
		"What error drives our eyes and ears amiss?\n"+
		"Until I know this sure uncertainty,\n"+
		"I'll entertain the offer'd fallacy.\n"+
		"LUCIANA\n"+
		"Dromio, go bid the servants spread for dinner.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"O, for my beads! I cross me for a sinner.\n"+
		"This is the fairy land: O spite of spites!\n"+
		"We talk with goblins, owls and sprites:\n"+
		"If we obey them not, this will ensue,\n"+
		"They'll suck our breath, or pinch us black and blue.\n"+
		"LUCIANA\n"+
		"Why pratest thou to thyself and answer'st not?\n"+
		"Dromio, thou drone, thou snail, thou slug, thou sot!\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"I am transformed, master, am I not?\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"I think thou art in mind, and so am I.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Nay, master, both in mind and in my shape.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Thou hast thine own form.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"No, I am an ape.\n"+
		"LUCIANA\n"+
		"If thou art changed to aught, 'tis to an ass.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"'Tis true; she rides me and I long for grass.\n"+
		"'Tis so, I am an ass; else it could never be\n"+
		"But I should know her as well as she knows me.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"Come, come, no longer will I be a fool,\n"+
		"To put the finger in the eye and weep,\n"+
		"Whilst man and master laugh my woes to scorn.\n"+
		"Come, sir, to dinner. Dromio, keep the gate.\n"+
		"Husband, I'll dine above with you to-day\n"+
		"And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.\n"+
		"Sirrah, if any ask you for your master,\n"+
		"Say he dines forth, and let no creature enter.\n"+
		"Come, sister. Dromio, play the porter well.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hell?\n"+
		"Sleeping or waking? mad or well-advised?\n"+
		"Known unto these, and to myself disguised!\n"+
		"I'll say as they say and persever so,\n"+
		"And in this mist at all adventures go.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Master, shall I be porter at the gate?\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"Ay; and let none enter, lest I break your pate.\n"+
		"LUCIANA\n"+
		"Come, come, Antipholus, we dine too late.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT III\n"+
		"SCENE I. Before the house of ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus.\n"+
		"Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus, DROMIO of Ephesus, ANGELO, and BALTHAZAR\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all;\n"+
		"My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours:\n"+
		"Say that I linger'd with you at your shop\n"+
		"To see the making of her carcanet,\n"+
		"And that to-morrow you will bring it home.\n"+
		"But here's a villain that would face me down\n"+
		"He met me on the mart, and that I beat him,\n"+
		"And charged him with a thousand marks in gold,\n"+
		"And that I did deny my wife and house.\n"+
		"Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know;\n"+
		"That you beat me at the mart, I have your hand to show:\n"+
		"If the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink,\n"+
		"Your own handwriting would tell you what I think.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"I think thou art an ass.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Marry, so it doth appear\n"+
		"By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear.\n"+
		"I should kick, being kick'd; and, being at that pass,\n"+
		"You would keep from my heels and beware of an ass.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"You're sad, Signior Balthazar: pray God our cheer\n"+
		"May answer my good will and your good welcome here.\n"+
		"BALTHAZAR\n"+
		"I hold your dainties cheap, sir, and your\n"+
		"welcome dear.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"O, Signior Balthazar, either at flesh or fish,\n"+
		"A table full of welcome make scarce one dainty dish.\n"+
		"BALTHAZAR\n"+
		"Good meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"And welcome more common; for that's nothing but words.\n"+
		"BALTHAZAR\n"+
		"Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Ay, to a niggardly host, and more sparing guest:\n"+
		"But though my cates be mean, take them in good part;\n"+
		"Better cheer may you have, but not with better heart.\n"+
		"But, soft! my door is lock'd. Go bid them let us in.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Maud, Bridget, Marian, Cicel, Gillian, Ginn!\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"[Within] Mome, malt-horse, capon, coxcomb,\n"+
		"idiot, patch!\n"+
		"Either get thee from the door, or sit down at the hatch.\n"+
		"Dost thou conjure for wenches, that thou call'st\n"+
		"for such store,\n"+
		"When one is one too many? Go, get thee from the door.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"What patch is made our porter? My master stays in\n"+
		"the street.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"[Within] Let him walk from whence he came, lest he\n"+
		"catch cold on's feet.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Who talks within there? ho, open the door!\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"[Within] Right, sir; I'll tell you when, an you tell\n"+
		"me wherefore.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Wherefore? for my dinner: I have not dined to-day.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"[Within] Nor to-day here you must not; come again\n"+
		"when you may.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"What art thou that keepest me out from the house I owe?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"[Within] The porter for this time, sir, and my name\n"+
		"is Dromio.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"O villain! thou hast stolen both mine office and my name.\n"+
		"The one ne'er got me credit, the other mickle blame.\n"+
		"If thou hadst been Dromio to-day in my place,\n"+
		"Thou wouldst have changed thy face for a name or thy\n"+
		"name for an ass.\n"+
		"LUCE\n"+
		"[Within] What a coil is there, Dromio? who are those\n"+
		"at the gate?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Let my master in, Luce.\n"+
		"LUCE\n"+
		"[Within] Faith, no; he comes too late;\n"+
		"And so tell your master.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"O Lord, I must laugh!\n"+
		"Have at you with a proverb--Shall I set in my staff?\n"+
		"LUCE\n"+
		"[Within] Have at you with another; that's--When?\n"+
		"can you tell?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"[Within] If thy name be call'd Luce--Luce, thou hast\n"+
		"answered him well.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"Do you hear, you minion? you'll let us in, I hope?\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"LUCE\n"+
		"[Within] I thought to have asked you.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"[Within] And you said no.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"So, come, help: well struck! there was blow for blow.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Thou baggage, let me in.\n"+
		"LUCE\n"+
		"[Within] Can you tell for whose sake?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Master, knock the door hard.\n"+
		"LUCE\n"+
		"[Within] Let him knock till it ache.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"You'll cry for this, minion, if I beat the door down.\n"+
		"LUCE\n"+
		"[Within] What needs all that, and a pair of stocks in the town?\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"[Within] Who is that at the door that keeps all\n"+
		"this noise?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"[Within] By my troth, your town is troubled with\n"+
		"unruly boys.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Are you there, wife? you might have come before.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"[Within] Your wife, sir knave! go get you from the door.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"If you went in pain, master, this 'knave' would go sore.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome: we would\n"+
		"fain have either.\n"+
		"BALTHAZAR\n"+
		"In debating which was best, we shall part with neither.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"They stand at the door, master; bid them welcome hither.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"There is something in the wind, that we cannot get in.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"You would say so, master, if your garments were thin.\n"+
		"Your cake there is warm within; you stand here in the cold:\n"+
		"It would make a man mad as a buck, to be so bought and sold.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Go fetch me something: I'll break ope the gate.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"[Within] Break any breaking here, and I'll break your\n"+
		"knave's pate.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"A man may break a word with you, sir, and words are but wind,\n"+
		"Ay, and break it in your face, so he break it not behind.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"[Within] It seems thou want'st breaking: out upon\n"+
		"thee, hind!\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Here's too much 'out upon thee!' I pray thee,\n"+
		"let me in.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"[Within] Ay, when fowls have no feathers and fish have no fin.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Well, I'll break in: go borrow me a crow.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"A crow without feather? Master, mean you so?\n"+
		"For a fish without a fin, there's a fowl without a feather;\n"+
		"If a crow help us in, sirrah, we'll pluck a crow together.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Go get thee gone; fetch me an iron crow.\n"+
		"BALTHAZAR\n"+
		"Have patience, sir; O, let it not be so!\n"+
		"Herein you war against your reputation\n"+
		"And draw within the compass of suspect\n"+
		"The unviolated honour of your wife.\n"+
		"Once this,--your long experience of her wisdom,\n"+
		"Her sober virtue, years and modesty,\n"+
		"Plead on her part some cause to you unknown:\n"+
		"And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse\n"+
		"Why at this time the doors are made against you.\n"+
		"Be ruled by me: depart in patience,\n"+
		"And let us to the Tiger all to dinner,\n"+
		"And about evening come yourself alone\n"+
		"To know the reason of this strange restraint.\n"+
		"If by strong hand you offer to break in\n"+
		"Now in the stirring passage of the day,\n"+
		"A vulgar comment will be made of it,\n"+
		"And that supposed by the common rout\n"+
		"Against your yet ungalled estimation\n"+
		"That may with foul intrusion enter in\n"+
		"And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;\n"+
		"For slander lives upon succession,\n"+
		"For ever housed where it gets possession.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"You have prevailed: I will depart in quiet,\n"+
		"And, in despite of mirth, mean to be merry.\n"+
		"I know a wench of excellent discourse,\n"+
		"Pretty and witty; wild, and yet, too, gentle:\n"+
		"There will we dine. This woman that I mean,\n"+
		"My wife--but, I protest, without desert--\n"+
		"Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal:\n"+
		"To her will we to dinner.\n"+
		"To Angelo\n"+
		"Get you home\n"+
		"And fetch the chain; by this I know 'tis made:\n"+
		"Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine;\n"+
		"For there's the house: that chain will I bestow--\n"+
		"Be it for nothing but to spite my wife--\n"+
		"Upon mine hostess there: good sir, make haste.\n"+
		"Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me,\n"+
		"I'll knock elsewhere, to see if they'll disdain me.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"I'll meet you at that place some hour hence.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Do so. This jest shall cost me some expense.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. The same.\n"+
		"Enter LUCIANA and ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse\n"+
		"LUCIANA\n"+
		"And may it be that you have quite forgot\n"+
		"A husband's office? shall, Antipholus.\n"+
		"Even in the spring of love, thy love-springs rot?\n"+
		"Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?\n"+
		"If you did wed my sister for her wealth,\n"+
		"Then for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness:\n"+
		"Or if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth;\n"+
		"Muffle your false love with some show of blindness:\n"+
		"Let not my sister read it in your eye;\n"+
		"Be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator;\n"+
		"Look sweet, be fair, become disloyalty;\n"+
		"Apparel vice like virtue's harbinger;\n"+
		"Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted;\n"+
		"Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint;\n"+
		"Be secret-false: what need she be acquainted?\n"+
		"What simple thief brags of his own attaint?\n"+
		"'Tis double wrong, to truant with your bed\n"+

		"Sweet mistress--what your name is else, I know not,\n"+
		"Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine,--\n"+
		"Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not\n"+
		"Than our earth's wonder, more than earth divine.\n"+

		"O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,\n"+
		"To drown me in thy sister's flood of tears:\n"+

		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Why, how now, Dromio! where runn'st thou so fast?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Do you know me, sir? am I Dromio? am I your man?\n"+
		"am I myself?\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Thou art Dromio, thou art my man, thou art thyself.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"I am an ass, I am a woman's man and besides myself.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"What woman's man? and how besides thyself? besides thyself?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Marry, sir, besides myself, I am due to a woman; one\n"+
		"that claims me, one that haunts me, one that will have me.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"What claim lays she to thee?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Marry sir, such claim as you would lay to your\n"+
		"horse; and she would have me as a beast: not that, I\n"+
		"being a beast, she would have me; but that she,\n"+
		"being a very beastly creature, lays claim to me.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"What is she?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"A very reverent body; ay, such a one as a man may\n"+
		"not speak of without he say 'Sir-reverence.' I have\n"+
		"but lean luck in the match, and yet is she a\n"+
		"wondrous fat marriage.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"How dost thou mean a fat marriage?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Marry, sir, she's the kitchen wench and all grease;\n"+
		"and I know not what use to put her to but to make a\n"+
		"lamp of her and run from her by her own light. I\n"+
		"warrant, her rags and the tallow in them will burn a\n"+
		"Poland winter: if she lives till doomsday,\n"+
		"she'll burn a week longer than the whole world.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"What complexion is she of?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Swart, like my shoe, but her face nothing half so\n"+
		"clean kept: for why, she sweats; a man may go over\n"+
		"shoes in the grime of it.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"That's a fault that water will mend.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"No, sir, 'tis in grain; Noah's flood could not do it.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"What's her name?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Nell, sir; but her name and three quarters, that's\n"+
		"an ell and three quarters, will not measure her from\n"+
		"hip to hip.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Then she bears some breadth?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"No longer from head to foot than from hip to hip:\n"+
		"she is spherical, like a globe; I could find out\n"+
		"countries in her.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"In what part of her body stands Ireland?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Marry, in her buttocks: I found it out by the bogs.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Where Scotland?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"I found it by the barrenness; hard in the palm of the hand.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Where France?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"In her forehead; armed and reverted, making war\n"+
		"against her heir.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Where England?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"I looked for the chalky cliffs, but I could find no\n"+
		"whiteness in them; but I guess it stood in her chin,\n"+
		"by the salt rheum that ran between France and it.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Where Spain?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Faith, I saw it not; but I felt it hot in her breath.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Where America, the Indies?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Oh, sir, upon her nose all o'er embellished with\n"+
		"rubies, carbuncles, sapphires, declining their rich\n"+
		"aspect to the hot breath of Spain; who sent whole\n"+
		"armadoes of caracks to be ballast at her nose.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Oh, sir, I did not look so low. To conclude, this\n"+
		"drudge, or diviner, laid claim to me, call'd me\n"+
		"Dromio; swore I was assured to her; told me what\n"+
		"privy marks I had about me, as, the mark of my\n"+
		"shoulder, the mole in my neck, the great wart on my\n"+
		"left arm, that I amazed ran from her as a witch:\n"+
		"And, I think, if my breast had not been made of\n"+
		"faith and my heart of steel,\n"+
		"She had transform'd me to a curtal dog and made\n"+
		"me turn i' the wheel.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Go hie thee presently, post to the road:\n"+
		"An if the wind blow any way from shore,\n"+
		"I will not harbour in this town to-night:\n"+
		"If any bark put forth, come to the mart,\n"+
		"Where I will walk till thou return to me.\n"+
		"If every one knows us and we know none,\n"+
		"'Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack and be gone.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"As from a bear a man would run for life,\n"+
		"So fly I from her that would be my wife.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"There's none but witches do inhabit here;\n"+
		"And therefore 'tis high time that I were hence.\n"+
		"She that doth call me husband, even my soul\n"+
		"Doth for a wife abhor. But her fair sister,\n"+
		"Possess'd with such a gentle sovereign grace,\n"+
		"Of such enchanting presence and discourse,\n"+
		"Hath almost made me traitor to myself:\n"+
		"But, lest myself be guilty to self-wrong,\n"+
		"I'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song.\n"+
		"Enter ANGELO with the chain\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Master Antipholus,--\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Ay, that's my name.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"I know it well, sir, lo, here is the chain.\n"+
		"I thought to have ta'en you at the Porpentine:\n"+
		"The chain unfinish'd made me stay thus long.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"What is your will that I shall do with this?\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"What please yourself, sir: I have made it for you.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Made it for me, sir! I bespoke it not.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Not once, nor twice, but twenty times you have.\n"+
		"Go home with it and please your wife withal;\n"+
		"And soon at supper-time I'll visit you\n"+
		"And then receive my money for the chain.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"I pray you, sir, receive the money now,\n"+
		"For fear you ne'er see chain nor money more.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"You are a merry man, sir: fare you well.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"What I should think of this, I cannot tell:\n"+
		"But this I think, there's no man is so vain\n"+
		"That would refuse so fair an offer'd chain.\n"+
		"I see a man here needs not live by shifts,\n"+
		"When in the streets he meets such golden gifts.\n"+
		"I'll to the mart, and there for Dromio stay\n"+
		"If any ship put out, then straight away.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"ACT IV\n"+
		"SCENE I. A public place.\n"+
		"Enter Second Merchant, ANGELO, and an Officer\n"+
		"Second Merchant\n"+
		"You know since Pentecost the sum is due,\n"+
		"And since I have not much importuned you;\n"+
		"Nor now I had not, but that I am bound\n"+
		"To Persia, and want guilders for my voyage:\n"+
		"Therefore make present satisfaction,\n"+
		"Or I'll attach you by this officer.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Even just the sum that I do owe to you\n"+
		"Is growing to me by Antipholus,\n"+
		"And in the instant that I met with you\n"+
		"He had of me a chain: at five o'clock\n"+
		"I shall receive the money for the same.\n"+
		"Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house,\n"+
		"I will discharge my bond and thank you too.\n"+
		"Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and DROMIO of Ephesus from the courtezan's\n"+
		"Officer\n"+
		"That labour may you save: see where he comes.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"While I go to the goldsmith's house, go thou\n"+
		"And buy a rope's end: that will I bestow\n"+
		"Among my wife and her confederates,\n"+
		"For locking me out of my doors by day.\n"+
		"But, soft! I see the goldsmith. Get thee gone;\n"+
		"Buy thou a rope and bring it home to me.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"I buy a thousand pound a year: I buy a rope.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"A man is well holp up that trusts to you:\n"+
		"I promised your presence and the chain;\n"+
		"But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me.\n"+
		"Belike you thought our love would last too long,\n"+
		"If it were chain'd together, and therefore came not.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Saving your merry humour, here's the note\n"+
		"How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat,\n"+
		"The fineness of the gold and chargeful fashion.\n"+
		"Which doth amount to three odd ducats more\n"+
		"Than I stand debted to this gentleman:\n"+
		"I pray you, see him presently discharged,\n"+
		"For he is bound to sea and stays but for it.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"I am not furnish'd with the present money;\n"+
		"Besides, I have some business in the town.\n"+
		"Good signior, take the stranger to my house\n"+
		"And with you take the chain and bid my wife\n"+
		"Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof:\n"+
		"Perchance I will be there as soon as you.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Then you will bring the chain to her yourself?\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"No; bear it with you, lest I come not time enough.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Well, sir, I will. Have you the chain about you?\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"An if I have not, sir, I hope you have;\n"+
		"Or else you may return without your money.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain:\n"+
		"Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman,\n"+
		"And I, to blame, have held him here too long.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Good Lord! you use this dalliance to excuse\n"+
		"Your breach of promise to the Porpentine.\n"+
		"I should have chid you for not bringing it,\n"+
		"But, like a shrew, you first begin to brawl.\n"+
		"Second Merchant\n"+
		"The hour steals on; I pray you, sir, dispatch.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"You hear how he importunes me;--the chain!\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Why, give it to my wife and fetch your money.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Come, come, you know I gave it you even now.\n"+
		"Either send the chain or send me by some token.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Fie, now you run this humour out of breath,\n"+
		"where's the chain? I pray you, let me see it.\n"+
		"Second Merchant\n"+
		"My business cannot brook this dalliance.\n"+
		"Good sir, say whether you'll answer me or no:\n"+
		"If not, I'll leave him to the officer.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"I answer you! what should I answer you?\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"The money that you owe me for the chain.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"I owe you none till I receive the chain.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"You know I gave it you half an hour since.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"You gave me none: you wrong me much to say so.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"You wrong me more, sir, in denying it:\n"+
		"Consider how it stands upon my credit.\n"+
		"Second Merchant\n"+
		"Well, officer, arrest him at my suit.\n"+
		"Officer\n"+
		"I do; and charge you in the duke's name to obey me.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"This touches me in reputation.\n"+
		"Either consent to pay this sum for me\n"+
		"Or I attach you by this officer.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Consent to pay thee that I never had!\n"+
		"Arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou darest.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Here is thy fee; arrest him, officer,\n"+
		"I would not spare my brother in this case,\n"+
		"If he should scorn me so apparently.\n"+
		"Officer\n"+
		"I do arrest you, sir: you hear the suit.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"I do obey thee till I give thee bail.\n"+
		"But, sirrah, you shall buy this sport as dear\n"+
		"As all the metal in your shop will answer.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Sir, sir, I will have law in Ephesus,\n"+
		"To your notorious shame; I doubt it not.\n"+
		"Enter DROMIO of Syracuse, from the bay\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Master, there is a bark of Epidamnum\n"+
		"That stays but till her owner comes aboard,\n"+
		"And then, sir, she bears away. Our fraughtage, sir,\n"+
		"I have convey'd aboard; and I have bought\n"+
		"The oil, the balsamum and aqua-vitae.\n"+
		"The ship is in her trim; the merry wind\n"+
		"Blows fair from land: they stay for nought at all\n"+
		"But for their owner, master, and yourself.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"How now! a madman! Why, thou peevish sheep,\n"+
		"What ship of Epidamnum stays for me?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"A ship you sent me to, to hire waftage.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Thou drunken slave, I sent thee for a rope;\n"+
		"And told thee to what purpose and what end.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"You sent me for a rope's end as soon:\n"+
		"You sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"I will debate this matter at more leisure\n"+
		"And teach your ears to list me with more heed.\n"+
		"To Adriana, villain, hie thee straight:\n"+
		"Give her this key, and tell her, in the desk\n"+
		"That's cover'd o'er with Turkish tapestry,\n"+
		"There is a purse of ducats; let her send it:\n"+
		"Tell her I am arrested in the street\n"+
		"And that shall bail me; hie thee, slave, be gone!\n"+
		"On, officer, to prison till it come.\n"+
		"Exeunt Second Merchant, Angelo, Officer, and Antipholus of Ephesus\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"To Adriana! that is where we dined,\n"+
		"Where Dowsabel did claim me for her husband:\n"+
		"She is too big, I hope, for me to compass.\n"+
		"Thither I must, although against my will,\n"+
		"For servants must their masters' minds fulfil.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE II. The house of ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus.\n"+
		"Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"Ah, Luciana, did he tempt thee so?\n"+
		"Mightst thou perceive austerely in his eye\n"+
		"That he did plead in earnest? yea or no?\n"+
		"Look'd he or red or pale, or sad or merrily?\n"+
		"What observation madest thou in this case\n"+
		"Of his heart's meteors tilting in his face?\n"+
		"LUCIANA\n"+
		"First he denied you had in him no right.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"He meant he did me none; the more my spite.\n"+
		"LUCIANA\n"+
		"Then swore he that he was a stranger here.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"And true he swore, though yet forsworn he were.\n"+
		"LUCIANA\n"+
		"Then pleaded I for you.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"And what said he?\n"+
		"LUCIANA\n"+
		"That love I begg'd for you he begg'd of me.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"With what persuasion did he tempt thy love?\n"+
		"LUCIANA\n"+
		"With words that in an honest suit might move.\n"+
		"First he did praise my beauty, then my speech.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"Didst speak him fair?\n"+
		"LUCIANA\n"+
		"Have patience, I beseech.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"I cannot, nor I will not, hold me still;\n"+
		"My tongue, though not my heart, shall have his will.\n"+
		"He is deformed, crooked, old and sere,\n"+
		"Ill-faced, worse bodied, shapeless everywhere;\n"+
		"Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;\n"+
		"Stigmatical in making, worse in mind.\n"+
		"LUCIANA\n"+
		"Who would be jealous then of such a one?\n"+
		"No evil lost is wail'd when it is gone.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"Ah, but I think him better than I say,\n"+
		"And yet would herein others' eyes were worse.\n"+
		"Far from her nest the lapwing cries away:\n"+
		"My heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse.\n"+
		"Enter DROMIO of Syracuse\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Here! go; the desk, the purse! sweet, now, make haste.\n"+
		"LUCIANA\n"+
		"How hast thou lost thy breath?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"By running fast.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"Where is thy master, Dromio? is he well?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"No, he's in Tartar limbo, worse than hell.\n"+
		"A devil in an everlasting garment hath him;\n"+
		"One whose hard heart is button'd up with steel;\n"+
		"A fiend, a fury, pitiless and rough;\n"+
		"A wolf, nay, worse, a fellow all in buff;\n"+
		"A back-friend, a shoulder-clapper, one that\n"+
		"countermands\n"+
		"The passages of alleys, creeks and narrow lands;\n"+
		"A hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well;\n"+
		"One that before the judgement carries poor souls to hell.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"Why, man, what is the matter?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"I do not know the matter: he is 'rested on the case.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"What, is he arrested? Tell me at whose suit.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"I know not at whose suit he is arrested well;\n"+
		"But he's in a suit of buff which 'rested him, that can I tell.\n"+
		"Will you send him, mistress, redemption, the money in his desk?\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"Go fetch it, sister.\n"+
		"Exit Luciana\n"+
		"This I wonder at,\n"+
		"That he, unknown to me, should be in debt.\n"+
		"Tell me, was he arrested on a band?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Not on a band, but on a stronger thing;\n"+
		"A chain, a chain! Do you not hear it ring?\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"What, the chain?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"No, no, the bell: 'tis time that I were gone:\n"+
		"It was two ere I left him, and now the clock\n"+
		"strikes one.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"The hours come back! that did I never hear.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"O, yes; if any hour meet a sergeant, a' turns back for\n"+
		"very fear.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"As if Time were in debt! how fondly dost thou reason!\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Time is a very bankrupt, and owes more than he's\n"+
		"worth, to season.\n"+
		"Nay, he's a thief too: have you not heard men say\n"+
		"That Time comes stealing on by night and day?\n"+
		"If Time be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the way,\n"+
		"Hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day?\n"+
		"Re-enter LUCIANA with a purse\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"Go, Dromio; there's the money, bear it straight;\n"+
		"And bring thy master home immediately.\n"+
		"Come, sister: I am press'd down with conceit--\n"+
		"Conceit, my comfort and my injury.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. A public place.\n"+
		"Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"There's not a man I meet but doth salute me\n"+
		"As if I were their well-acquainted friend;\n"+
		"And every one doth call me by my name.\n"+
		"Some tender money to me; some invite me;\n"+
		"Some other give me thanks for kindnesses;\n"+
		"Some offer me commodities to buy:\n"+
		"Even now a tailor call'd me in his shop\n"+
		"And show'd me silks that he had bought for me,\n"+
		"And therewithal took measure of my body.\n"+
		"Sure, these are but imaginary wiles\n"+
		"And Lapland sorcerers inhabit here.\n"+
		"Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Master, here's the gold you sent me for. What, have\n"+
		"you got the picture of old Adam new-apparelled?\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"What gold is this? what Adam dost thou mean?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Not that Adam that kept the Paradise but that Adam\n"+
		"that keeps the prison: he that goes in the calf's\n"+
		"skin that was killed for the Prodigal; he that came\n"+
		"behind you, sir, like an evil angel, and bid you\n"+
		"forsake your liberty.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"I understand thee not.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"No? why, 'tis a plain case: he that went, like a\n"+
		"bass-viol, in a case of leather; the man, sir,\n"+
		"that, when gentlemen are tired, gives them a sob\n"+
		"and 'rests them; he, sir, that takes pity on decayed\n"+
		"men and gives them suits of durance; he that sets up\n"+
		"his rest to do more exploits with his mace than a\n"+
		"morris-pike.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"What, thou meanest an officer?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Ay, sir, the sergeant of the band, he that brings\n"+
		"any man to answer it that breaks his band; one that\n"+
		"thinks a man always going to bed, and says, 'God\n"+
		"give you good rest!'\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Well, sir, there rest in your foolery. Is there any\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Why, sir, I brought you word an hour since that the\n"+
		"bark Expedition put forth to-night; and then were\n"+
		"you hindered by the sergeant, to tarry for the hoy\n"+
		"Delay. Here are the angels that you sent for to\n"+
		"deliver you.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"The fellow is distract, and so am I;\n"+
		"And here we wander in illusions:\n"+
		"Some blessed power deliver us from hence!\n"+
		"Enter a Courtezan\n"+
		"Courtezan\n"+
		"Well met, well met, Master Antipholus.\n"+
		"I see, sir, you have found the goldsmith now:\n"+
		"Is that the chain you promised me to-day?\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Satan, avoid! I charge thee, tempt me not.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Master, is this Mistress Satan?\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"It is the devil.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Nay, she is worse, she is the devil's dam; and here\n"+
		"she comes in the habit of a light wench: and thereof\n"+
		"comes that the wenches say 'God damn me;' that's as\n"+
		"much to say 'God make me a light wench.' It is\n"+
		"written, they appear to men like angels of light:\n"+
		"light is an effect of fire, and fire will burn;\n"+
		"ergo, light wenches will burn. Come not near her.\n"+
		"Courtezan\n"+
		"Your man and you are marvellous merry, sir.\n"+
		"Will you go with me? We'll mend our dinner here?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Master, if you do, expect spoon-meat; or bespeak a\n"+
		"long spoon.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Why, Dromio?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Marry, he must have a long spoon that must eat with\n"+
		"the devil.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Avoid then, fiend! what tell'st thou me of supping?\n"+
		"Thou art, as you are all, a sorceress:\n"+
		"I conjure thee to leave me and be gone.\n"+
		"Courtezan\n"+
		"Give me the ring of mine you had at dinner,\n"+
		"Or, for my diamond, the chain you promised,\n"+
		"And I'll be gone, sir, and not trouble you.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Some devils ask but the parings of one's nail,\n"+
		"A rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin,\n"+
		"A nut, a cherry-stone;\n"+
		"But she, more covetous, would have a chain.\n"+
		"Master, be wise: an if you give it her,\n"+
		"The devil will shake her chain and fright us with it.\n"+
		"Courtezan\n"+
		"I pray you, sir, my ring, or else the chain:\n"+
		"I hope you do not mean to cheat me so.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Avaunt, thou witch! Come, Dromio, let us go.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"'Fly pride,' says the peacock: mistress, that you know.\n"+
		"Exeunt Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse\n"+
		"Courtezan\n"+
		"Now, out of doubt Antipholus is mad,\n"+
		"Else would he never so demean himself.\n"+
		"A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats,\n"+
		"And for the same he promised me a chain:\n"+
		"Both one and other he denies me now.\n"+
		"The reason that I gather he is mad,\n"+
		"Besides this present instance of his rage,\n"+
		"Is a mad tale he told to-day at dinner,\n"+
		"Of his own doors being shut against his entrance.\n"+
		"Belike his wife, acquainted with his fits,\n"+
		"On purpose shut the doors against his way.\n"+
		"My way is now to hie home to his house,\n"+
		"And tell his wife that, being lunatic,\n"+
		"He rush'd into my house and took perforce\n"+
		"My ring away. This course I fittest choose;\n"+
		"For forty ducats is too much to lose.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE IV. A street.\n"+
		"Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and the Officer\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Fear me not, man; I will not break away:\n"+
		"I'll give thee, ere I leave thee, so much money,\n"+
		"To warrant thee, as I am 'rested for.\n"+
		"My wife is in a wayward mood to-day,\n"+
		"And will not lightly trust the messenger\n"+
		"That I should be attach'd in Ephesus,\n"+
		"I tell you, 'twill sound harshly in her ears.\n"+
		"Enter DROMIO of Ephesus with a rope's-end\n"+
		"Here comes my man; I think he brings the money.\n"+
		"How now, sir! have you that I sent you for?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Here's that, I warrant you, will pay them all.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"But where's the money?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Why, sir, I gave the money for the rope.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Five hundred ducats, villain, for a rope?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"I'll serve you, sir, five hundred at the rate.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"To a rope's-end, sir; and to that end am I returned.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"And to that end, sir, I will welcome you.\n"+
		"Beating him\n"+
		"Officer\n"+
		"Good sir, be patient.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Nay, 'tis for me to be patient; I am in adversity.\n"+
		"Officer\n"+
		"Good, now, hold thy tongue.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Thou whoreson, senseless villain!\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"I would I were senseless, sir, that I might not feel\n"+
		"your blows.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"Thou art sensible in nothing but blows, and so is an\n"+
		"ass.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"I am an ass, indeed; you may prove it by my long\n"+
		"ears. I have served him from the hour of my\n"+
		"nativity to this instant, and have nothing at his\n"+
		"hands for my service but blows. When I am cold, he\n"+
		"heats me with beating; when I am warm, he cools me\n"+
		"with beating; I am waked with it when I sleep;\n"+
		"raised with it when I sit; driven out of doors with\n"+
		"it when I go from home; welcomed home with it when\n"+
		"I return; nay, I bear it on my shoulders, as a\n"+
		"beggar wont her brat; and, I think when he hath\n"+
		"lamed me, I shall beg with it from door to door.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Come, go along; my wife is coming yonder.\n"+
		"Enter ADRIANA, LUCIANA, the Courtezan, and PINCH\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Mistress, 'respice finem,' respect your end; or\n"+
		"rather, the prophecy like the parrot, 'beware the\n"+
		"rope's-end.'\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Wilt thou still talk?\n"+
		"Beating him\n"+
		"Courtezan\n"+
		"How say you now? is not your husband mad?\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"His incivility confirms no less.\n"+
		"Good Doctor Pinch, you are a conjurer;\n"+
		"Establish him in his true sense again,\n"+
		"And I will please you what you will demand.\n"+
		"LUCIANA\n"+
		"Alas, how fiery and how sharp he looks!\n"+
		"Courtezan\n"+
		"Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy!\n"+
		"PINCH\n"+
		"Give me your hand and let me feel your pulse.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"There is my hand, and let it feel your ear.\n"+
		"Striking him\n"+
		"PINCH\n"+
		"I charge thee, Satan, housed within this man,\n"+
		"To yield possession to my holy prayers\n"+
		"And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight:\n"+
		"I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven!\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Peace, doting wizard, peace! I am not mad.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"O, that thou wert not, poor distressed soul!\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"You minion, you, are these your customers?\n"+
		"Did this companion with the saffron face\n"+
		"Revel and feast it at my house to-day,\n"+
		"Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut\n"+
		"And I denied to enter in my house?\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"O husband, God doth know you dined at home;\n"+
		"Where would you had remain'd until this time,\n"+
		"Free from these slanders and this open shame!\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Dined at home! Thou villain, what sayest thou?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Sir, sooth to say, you did not dine at home.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Were not my doors lock'd up and I shut out?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Perdie, your doors were lock'd and you shut out.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"And did not she herself revile me there?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Sans fable, she herself reviled you there.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Did not her kitchen-maid rail, taunt, and scorn me?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Certes, she did; the kitchen-vestal scorn'd you.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"And did not I in rage depart from thence?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"In verity you did; my bones bear witness,\n"+
		"That since have felt the vigour of his rage.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"Is't good to soothe him in these contraries?\n"+
		"PINCH\n"+
		"It is no shame: the fellow finds his vein,\n"+
		"And yielding to him humours well his frenzy.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Thou hast suborn'd the goldsmith to arrest me.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"Alas, I sent you money to redeem you,\n"+
		"By Dromio here, who came in haste for it.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Money by me! heart and goodwill you might;\n"+
		"But surely master, not a rag of money.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Went'st not thou to her for a purse of ducats?\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"He came to me and I deliver'd it.\n"+
		"LUCIANA\n"+
		"And I am witness with her that she did.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"God and the rope-maker bear me witness\n"+
		"That I was sent for nothing but a rope!\n"+
		"PINCH\n"+
		"Mistress, both man and master is possess'd;\n"+
		"I know it by their pale and deadly looks:\n"+
		"They must be bound and laid in some dark room.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Say, wherefore didst thou lock me forth to-day?\n"+
		"And why dost thou deny the bag of gold?\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"I did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"And, gentle master, I received no gold;\n"+
		"But I confess, sir, that we were lock'd out.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"Dissembling villain, thou speak'st false in both.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all;\n"+
		"And art confederate with a damned pack\n"+
		"To make a loathsome abject scorn of me:\n"+
		"But with these nails I'll pluck out these false eyes\n"+
		"That would behold in me this shameful sport.\n"+
		"Enter three or four, and offer to bind him. He strives\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"O, bind him, bind him! let him not come near me.\n"+
		"PINCH\n"+
		"More company! The fiend is strong within him.\n"+
		"LUCIANA\n"+
		"Ay me, poor man, how pale and wan he looks!\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"What, will you murder me? Thou gaoler, thou,\n"+
		"I am thy prisoner: wilt thou suffer them\n"+
		"To make a rescue?\n"+
		"Officer\n"+
		"Masters, let him go\n"+
		"He is my prisoner, and you shall not have him.\n"+
		"PINCH\n"+
		"Go bind this man, for he is frantic too.\n"+
		"They offer to bind Dromio of Ephesus\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"What wilt thou do, thou peevish officer?\n"+
		"Hast thou delight to see a wretched man\n"+
		"Do outrage and displeasure to himself?\n"+
		"Officer\n"+
		"He is my prisoner: if I let him go,\n"+
		"The debt he owes will be required of me.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"I will discharge thee ere I go from thee:\n"+
		"Bear me forthwith unto his creditor,\n"+
		"And, knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it.\n"+
		"Good master doctor, see him safe convey'd\n"+
		"Home to my house. O most unhappy day!\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"O most unhappy strumpet!\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Master, I am here entered in bond for you.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Out on thee, villain! wherefore dost thou mad me?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Will you be bound for nothing? be mad, good master:\n"+
		"cry 'The devil!'\n"+
		"LUCIANA\n"+
		"God help, poor souls, how idly do they talk!\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"Go bear him hence. Sister, go you with me.\n"+
		"Exeunt all but Adriana, Luciana, Officer and Courtezan\n"+
		"Say now, whose suit is he arrested at?\n"+
		"Officer\n"+
		"One Angelo, a goldsmith: do you know him?\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"I know the man. What is the sum he owes?\n"+
		"Officer\n"+
		"Two hundred ducats.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"Say, how grows it due?\n"+
		"Officer\n"+
		"Due for a chain your husband had of him.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"He did bespeak a chain for me, but had it not.\n"+
		"Courtezan\n"+
		"When as your husband all in rage to-day\n"+
		"Came to my house and took away my ring--\n"+
		"The ring I saw upon his finger now--\n"+
		"Straight after did I meet him with a chain.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"It may be so, but I did never see it.\n"+
		"Come, gaoler, bring me where the goldsmith is:\n"+
		"I long to know the truth hereof at large.\n"+
		"Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse with his rapier drawn, and DROMIO of Syracuse\n"+
		"LUCIANA\n"+
		"God, for thy mercy! they are loose again.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"And come with naked swords.\n"+
		"Let's call more help to have them bound again.\n"+
		"Officer\n"+
		"Away! they'll kill us.\n"+
		"Exeunt all but Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"I see these witches are afraid of swords.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"She that would be your wife now ran from you.\n"+

		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Come to the Centaur; fetch our stuff from thence:\n"+
		"I long that we were safe and sound aboard.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Faith, stay here this night; they will surely do us\n"+
		"no harm: you saw they speak us fair, give us gold:\n"+
		"methinks they are such a gentle nation that, but for\n"+
		"the mountain of mad flesh that claims marriage of\n"+
		"me, I could find in my heart to stay here still and\n"+
		"turn witch.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"I will not stay to-night for all the town;\n"+
		"Therefore away, to get our stuff aboard.\n"+

		"Enter Second Merchant and ANGELO\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"I am sorry, sir, that I have hinder'd you;\n"+
		"But, I protest, he had the chain of me,\n"+
		"Though most dishonestly he doth deny it.\n"+
		"Second Merchant\n"+
		"How is the man esteemed here in the city?\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Of very reverend reputation, sir,\n"+
		"Of credit infinite, highly beloved,\n"+
		"Second to none that lives here in the city:\n"+
		"His word might bear my wealth at any time.\n"+
		"Second Merchant\n"+
		"Speak softly; yonder, as I think, he walks.\n"+
		"Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse and DROMIO of Syracuse\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"'Tis so; and that self chain about his neck\n"+
		"Which he forswore most monstrously to have.\n"+
		"Good sir, draw near to me, I'll speak to him.\n"+
		"Signior Antipholus, I wonder much\n"+
		"That you would put me to this shame and trouble;\n"+
		"And, not without some scandal to yourself,\n"+
		"With circumstance and oaths so to deny\n"+
		"This chain which now you wear so openly:\n"+
		"Beside the charge, the shame, imprisonment,\n"+
		"You have done wrong to this my honest friend,\n"+
		"Who, but for staying on our controversy,\n"+
		"Had hoisted sail and put to sea to-day:\n"+
		"This chain you had of me; can you deny it?\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"I think I had; I never did deny it.\n"+
		"Second Merchant\n"+
		"Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?\n"+
		"Second Merchant\n"+
		"These ears of mine, thou know'st did hear thee.\n"+
		"Fie on thee, wretch! 'tis pity that thou livest\n"+
		"To walk where any honest man resort.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Thou art a villain to impeach me thus:\n"+
		"I'll prove mine honour and mine honesty\n"+
		"Against thee presently, if thou darest stand.\n"+
		"Second Merchant\n"+
		"I dare, and do defy thee for a villain.\n"+
		"They draw\n"+
		"Enter ADRIANA, LUCIANA, the Courtezan, and others\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"Hold, hurt him not, for God's sake! he is mad.\n"+
		"Some get within him, take his sword away:\n"+
		"Bind Dromio too, and bear them to my house.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Run, master, run; for God's sake, take a house!\n"+
		"This is some priory. In, or we are spoil'd!\n"+
		"Exeunt Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse to the Priory\n"+
		"Enter the Lady Abbess, AEMILIA\n"+
		"AEMELIA\n"+
		"Be quiet, people. Wherefore throng you hither?\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"To fetch my poor distracted husband hence.\n"+
		"Let us come in, that we may bind him fast\n"+
		"And bear him home for his recovery.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"I knew he was not in his perfect wits.\n"+
		"Second Merchant\n"+
		"I am sorry now that I did draw on him.\n"+
		"AEMELIA\n"+
		"How long hath this possession held the man?\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,\n"+
		"And much different from the man he was;\n"+
		"But till this afternoon his passion\n"+
		"Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.\n"+
		"AEMELIA\n"+
		"Hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea?\n"+
		"Buried some dear friend? Hath not else his eye\n"+
		"Stray'd his affection in unlawful love?\n"+
		"A sin prevailing much in youthful men,\n"+
		"Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing.\n"+
		"Which of these sorrows is he subject to?\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"To none of these, except it be the last;\n"+
		"Namely, some love that drew him oft from home.\n"+
		"AEMELIA\n"+
		"You should for that have reprehended him.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"Why, so I did.\n"+
		"AEMELIA\n"+
		"Ay, but not rough enough.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"As roughly as my modesty would let me.\n"+
		"AEMELIA\n"+
		"Haply, in private.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"And in assemblies too.\n"+
		"AEMELIA\n"+
		"Ay, but not enough.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"It was the copy of our conference:\n"+
		"In bed he slept not for my urging it;\n"+
		"At board he fed not for my urging it;\n"+
		"Alone, it was the subject of my theme;\n"+
		"In company I often glanced it;\n"+
		"Still did I tell him it was vile and bad.\n"+
		"AEMELIA\n"+
		"And thereof came it that the man was mad.\n"+
		"The venom clamours of a jealous woman\n"+
		"Poisons more deadly than a mad dog's tooth.\n"+
		"It seems his sleeps were hinder'd by thy railing,\n"+
		"And therefore comes it that his head is light.\n"+
		"Thou say'st his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings:\n"+
		"Unquiet meals make ill digestions;\n"+
		"Thereof the raging fire of fever bred;\n"+
		"And what's a fever but a fit of madness?\n"+
		"Thou say'st his sports were hinderd by thy brawls:\n"+
		"Sweet recreation barr'd, what doth ensue\n"+
		"But moody and dull melancholy,\n"+
		"Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,\n"+
		"And at her heels a huge infectious troop\n"+
		"Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?\n"+
		"In food, in sport and life-preserving rest\n"+
		"To be disturb'd, would mad or man or beast:\n"+
		"The consequence is then thy jealous fits\n"+
		"Have scared thy husband from the use of wits.\n"+
		"LUCIANA\n"+
		"She never reprehended him but mildly,\n"+
		"When he demean'd himself rough, rude and wildly.\n"+
		"Why bear you these rebukes and answer not?\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"She did betray me to my own reproof.\n"+
		"Good people enter and lay hold on him.\n"+
		"AEMELIA\n"+
		"No, not a creature enters in my house.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"Then let your servants bring my husband forth.\n"+
		"AEMELIA\n"+
		"Neither: he took this place for sanctuary,\n"+
		"And it shall privilege him from your hands\n"+
		"Till I have brought him to his wits again,\n"+
		"Or lose my labour in assaying it.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"I will attend my husband, be his nurse,\n"+
		"Diet his sickness, for it is my office,\n"+
		"And will have no attorney but myself;\n"+
		"And therefore let me have him home with me.\n"+
		"AEMELIA\n"+
		"Be patient; for I will not let him stir\n"+
		"Till I have used the approved means I have,\n"+
		"With wholesome syrups, drugs and holy prayers,\n"+
		"To make of him a formal man again:\n"+
		"It is a branch and parcel of mine oath,\n"+
		"A charitable duty of my order.\n"+
		"Therefore depart and leave him here with me.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"I will not hence and leave my husband here:\n"+
		"And ill it doth beseem your holiness\n"+
		"To separate the husband and the wife.\n"+
		"AEMELIA\n"+
		"Be quiet and depart: thou shalt not have him.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"LUCIANA\n"+
		"Complain unto the duke of this indignity.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"Come, go: I will fall prostrate at his feet\n"+
		"And never rise until my tears and prayers\n"+
		"Have won his grace to come in person hither\n"+
		"And take perforce my husband from the abbess.\n"+
		"Second Merchant\n"+
		"By this, I think, the dial points at five:\n"+
		"Anon, I'm sure, the duke himself in person\n"+
		"Comes this way to the melancholy vale,\n"+
		"The place of death and sorry execution,\n"+
		"Behind the ditches of the abbey here.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Upon what cause?\n"+
		"Second Merchant\n"+
		"To see a reverend Syracusian merchant,\n"+
		"Who put unluckily into this bay\n"+
		"Against the laws and statutes of this town,\n"+
		"Beheaded publicly for his offence.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"See where they come: we will behold his death.\n"+
		"LUCIANA\n"+
		"Kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey.\n"+
		"Enter DUKE SOLINUS, attended; AEGEON bareheaded; with the Headsman and other Officers\n"+
		"DUKE SOLINUS\n"+
		"Yet once again proclaim it publicly,\n"+
		"If any friend will pay the sum for him,\n"+
		"He shall not die; so much we tender him.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"Justice, most sacred duke, against the abbess!\n"+
		"DUKE SOLINUS\n"+
		"She is a virtuous and a reverend lady:\n"+
		"It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"May it please your grace, Antipholus, my husband,\n"+
		"Whom I made lord of me and all I had,\n"+
		"At your important letters,--this ill day\n"+
		"A most outrageous fit of madness took him;\n"+
		"That desperately he hurried through the street,\n"+
		"With him his bondman, all as mad as he--\n"+
		"Doing displeasure to the citizens\n"+
		"By rushing in their houses, bearing thence\n"+
		"Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like.\n"+
		"Once did I get him bound and sent him home,\n"+
		"Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went,\n"+
		"That here and there his fury had committed.\n"+
		"Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,\n"+
		"He broke from those that had the guard of him;\n"+
		"And with his mad attendant and himself,\n"+
		"Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords,\n"+
		"Met us again and madly bent on us,\n"+
		"Chased us away; till, raising of more aid,\n"+
		"We came again to bind them. Then they fled\n"+
		"Into this abbey, whither we pursued them:\n"+
		"And here the abbess shuts the gates on us\n"+
		"And will not suffer us to fetch him out,\n"+
		"Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.\n"+
		"Therefore, most gracious duke, with thy command\n"+
		"Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help.\n"+
		"DUKE SOLINUS\n"+
		"Long since thy husband served me in my wars,\n"+
		"And I to thee engaged a prince's word,\n"+
		"When thou didst make him master of thy bed,\n"+
		"To do him all the grace and good I could.\n"+
		"Go, some of you, knock at the abbey-gate\n"+
		"And bid the lady abbess come to me.\n"+
		"I will determine this before I stir.\n"+
		"Enter a Servant\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"O mistress, mistress, shift and save yourself!\n"+
		"My master and his man are both broke loose,\n"+
		"Beaten the maids a-row and bound the doctor\n"+
		"Whose beard they have singed off with brands of fire;\n"+
		"And ever, as it blazed, they threw on him\n"+
		"Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair:\n"+
		"My master preaches patience to him and the while\n"+
		"His man with scissors nicks him like a fool,\n"+
		"And sure, unless you send some present help,\n"+
		"Between them they will kill the conjurer.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"Peace, fool! thy master and his man are here,\n"+
		"And that is false thou dost report to us.\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"Mistress, upon my life, I tell you true;\n"+
		"I have not breathed almost since I did see it.\n"+
		"He cries for you, and vows, if he can take you,\n"+
		"To scorch your face and to disfigure you.\n"+
		"Cry within\n"+
		"Hark, hark! I hear him, mistress. fly, be gone!\n"+
		"DUKE SOLINUS\n"+
		"Come, stand by me; fear nothing. Guard with halberds!\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"Ay me, it is my husband! Witness you,\n"+
		"That he is borne about invisible:\n"+
		"Even now we housed him in the abbey here;\n"+
		"And now he's there, past thought of human reason.\n"+
		"Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and DROMIO of Ephesus\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Justice, most gracious duke, O, grant me justice!\n"+
		"Even for the service that long since I did thee,\n"+
		"When I bestrid thee in the wars and took\n"+
		"Deep scars to save thy life; even for the blood\n"+
		"That then I lost for thee, now grant me justice.\n"+
		"AEGEON\n"+
		"Unless the fear of death doth make me dote,\n"+
		"I see my son Antipholus and Dromio.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Justice, sweet prince, against that woman there!\n"+
		"She whom thou gavest to me to be my wife,\n"+
		"That hath abused and dishonour'd me\n"+
		"Even in the strength and height of injury!\n"+
		"Beyond imagination is the wrong\n"+
		"That she this day hath shameless thrown on me.\n"+
		"DUKE SOLINUS\n"+
		"Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"This day, great duke, she shut the doors upon me,\n"+
		"While she with harlots feasted in my house.\n"+
		"DUKE SOLINUS\n"+
		"A grievous fault! Say, woman, didst thou so?\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"No, my good lord: myself, he and my sister\n"+
		"To-day did dine together. So befall my soul\n"+
		"As this is false he burdens me withal!\n"+
		"LUCIANA\n"+
		"Ne'er may I look on day, nor sleep on night,\n"+
		"But she tells to your highness simple truth!\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"O perjured woman! They are both forsworn:\n"+
		"In this the madman justly chargeth them.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"My liege, I am advised what I say,\n"+
		"Neither disturbed with the effect of wine,\n"+
		"Nor heady-rash, provoked with raging ire,\n"+
		"Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad.\n"+
		"This woman lock'd me out this day from dinner:\n"+
		"That goldsmith there, were he not pack'd with her,\n"+
		"Could witness it, for he was with me then;\n"+
		"Who parted with me to go fetch a chain,\n"+
		"Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,\n"+
		"Where Balthazar and I did dine together.\n"+
		"Our dinner done, and he not coming thither,\n"+
		"I went to seek him: in the street I met him\n"+
		"And in his company that gentleman.\n"+
		"There did this perjured goldsmith swear me down\n"+
		"That I this day of him received the chain,\n"+
		"Which, God he knows, I saw not: for the which\n"+
		"He did arrest me with an officer.\n"+
		"I did obey, and sent my peasant home\n"+
		"For certain ducats: he with none return'd\n"+
		"Then fairly I bespoke the officer\n"+
		"To go in person with me to my house.\n"+
		"By the way we met\n"+
		"My wife, her sister, and a rabble more\n"+
		"Of vile confederates. Along with them\n"+
		"They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-faced villain,\n"+
		"A mere anatomy, a mountebank,\n"+
		"A threadbare juggler and a fortune-teller,\n"+
		"A needy, hollow-eyed, sharp-looking wretch,\n"+
		"A dead-looking man: this pernicious slave,\n"+
		"Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer,\n"+
		"And, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,\n"+
		"And with no face, as 'twere, outfacing me,\n"+
		"Cries out, I was possess'd. Then all together\n"+
		"They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence\n"+
		"And in a dark and dankish vault at home\n"+
		"There left me and my man, both bound together;\n"+
		"Till, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,\n"+
		"I gain'd my freedom, and immediately\n"+
		"Ran hither to your grace; whom I beseech\n"+
		"To give me ample satisfaction\n"+
		"For these deep shames and great indignities.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him,\n"+
		"That he dined not at home, but was lock'd out.\n"+
		"DUKE SOLINUS\n"+
		"But had he such a chain of thee or no?\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"He had, my lord: and when he ran in here,\n"+
		"These people saw the chain about his neck.\n"+
		"Second Merchant\n"+
		"Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine\n"+
		"Heard you confess you had the chain of him\n"+
		"After you first forswore it on the mart:\n"+
		"And thereupon I drew my sword on you;\n"+
		"And then you fled into this abbey here,\n"+
		"From whence, I think, you are come by miracle.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"I never came within these abbey-walls,\n"+
		"Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me:\n"+
		"I never saw the chain, so help me Heaven!\n"+
		"And this is false you burden me withal.\n"+
		"DUKE SOLINUS\n"+
		"Why, what an intricate impeach is this!\n"+
		"I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.\n"+
		"If here you housed him, here he would have been;\n"+
		"If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly:\n"+
		"You say he dined at home; the goldsmith here\n"+
		"Denies that saying. Sirrah, what say you?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Sir, he dined with her there, at the Porpentine.\n"+
		"Courtezan\n"+
		"He did, and from my finger snatch'd that ring.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"'Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of her.\n"+
		"DUKE SOLINUS\n"+
		"Saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here?\n"+
		"Courtezan\n"+
		"As sure, my liege, as I do see your grace.\n"+
		"DUKE SOLINUS\n"+
		"Why, this is strange. Go call the abbess hither.\n"+
		"I think you are all mated or stark mad.\n"+
		"Exit one to Abbess\n"+
		"AEGEON\n"+
		"Most mighty duke, vouchsafe me speak a word:\n"+
		"Haply I see a friend will save my life\n"+
		"And pay the sum that may deliver me.\n"+
		"DUKE SOLINUS\n"+
		"Speak freely, Syracusian, what thou wilt.\n"+
		"AEGEON\n"+
		"Is not your name, sir, call'd Antipholus?\n"+
		"And is not that your bondman, Dromio?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Within this hour I was his bondman sir,\n"+
		"But he, I thank him, gnaw'd in two my cords:\n"+
		"Now am I Dromio and his man unbound.\n"+
		"AEGEON\n"+
		"I am sure you both of you remember me.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Ourselves we do remember, sir, by you;\n"+
		"For lately we were bound, as you are now\n"+
		"You are not Pinch's patient, are you, sir?\n"+
		"AEGEON\n"+
		"Why look you strange on me? you know me well.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"I never saw you in my life till now.\n"+
		"AEGEON\n"+
		"O, grief hath changed me since you saw me last,\n"+
		"And careful hours with time's deformed hand\n"+
		"Have written strange defeatures in my face:\n"+
		"But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice?\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Neither.\n"+
		"AEGEON\n"+
		"Dromio, nor thou?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"No, trust me, sir, nor I.\n"+
		"AEGEON\n"+
		"I am sure thou dost.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Ay, sir, but I am sure I do not; and whatsoever a\n"+
		"man denies, you are now bound to believe him.\n"+
		"AEGEON\n"+
		"Not know my voice! O time's extremity,\n"+
		"Hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor tongue\n"+
		"In seven short years, that here my only son\n"+
		"Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares?\n"+
		"Though now this grained face of mine be hid\n"+
		"In sap-consuming winter's drizzled snow,\n"+
		"And all the conduits of my blood froze up,\n"+
		"Yet hath my night of life some memory,\n"+
		"My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left,\n"+
		"My dull deaf ears a little use to hear:\n"+
		"All these old witnesses--I cannot err--\n"+
		"Tell me thou art my son Antipholus.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"I never saw my father in my life.\n"+
		"AEGEON\n"+
		"But seven years since, in Syracusa, boy,\n"+
		"Thou know'st we parted: but perhaps, my son,\n"+
		"Thou shamest to acknowledge me in misery.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"The duke and all that know me in the city\n"+
		"Can witness with me that it is not so\n"+
		"I ne'er saw Syracusa in my life.\n"+
		"DUKE SOLINUS\n"+
		"I tell thee, Syracusian, twenty years\n"+
		"Have I been patron to Antipholus,\n"+
		"During which time he ne'er saw Syracusa:\n"+
		"I see thy age and dangers make thee dote.\n"+
		"Re-enter AEMILIA, with ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse and DROMIO of Syracuse\n"+
		"AEMELIA\n"+
		"Most mighty duke, behold a man much wrong'd.\n"+
		"All gather to see them\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me.\n"+
		"DUKE SOLINUS\n"+
		"One of these men is Genius to the other;\n"+
		"And so of these. Which is the natural man,\n"+
		"And which the spirit? who deciphers them?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"I, sir, am Dromio; command him away.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"I, sir, am Dromio; pray, let me stay.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"AEgeon art thou not? or else his ghost?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"O, my old master! who hath bound him here?\n"+
		"AEMELIA\n"+
		"Whoever bound him, I will loose his bonds\n"+
		"And gain a husband by his liberty.\n"+
		"Speak, old AEgeon, if thou be'st the man\n"+
		"That hadst a wife once call'd AEmilia\n"+
		"That bore thee at a burden two fair sons:\n"+
		"O, if thou be'st the same AEgeon, speak,\n"+
		"And speak unto the same AEmilia!\n"+
		"AEGEON\n"+
		"If I dream not, thou art AEmilia:\n"+
		"If thou art she, tell me where is that son\n"+
		"That floated with thee on the fatal raft?\n"+
		"AEMELIA\n"+
		"By men of Epidamnum he and I\n"+
		"And the twin Dromio all were taken up;\n"+
		"But by and by rude fishermen of Corinth\n"+
		"By force took Dromio and my son from them\n"+
		"And me they left with those of Epidamnum.\n"+
		"What then became of them I cannot tell\n"+
		"I to this fortune that you see me in.\n"+
		"DUKE SOLINUS\n"+
		"Why, here begins his morning story right;\n"+
		"These two Antipholuses, these two so like,\n"+
		"And these two Dromios, one in semblance,--\n"+
		"Besides her urging of her wreck at sea,--\n"+
		"These are the parents to these children,\n"+
		"Which accidentally are met together.\n"+
		"Antipholus, thou camest from Corinth first?\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"No, sir, not I; I came from Syracuse.\n"+
		"DUKE SOLINUS\n"+
		"Stay, stand apart; I know not which is which.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord,--\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"And I with him.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Brought to this town by that most famous warrior,\n"+
		"Duke Menaphon, your most renowned uncle.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"Which of you two did dine with me to-day?\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"I, gentle mistress.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"And are not you my husband?\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"No; I say nay to that.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"And so do I; yet did she call me so:\n"+
		"And this fair gentlewoman, her sister here,\n"+
		"Did call me brother.\n"+
		"To Luciana\n"+
		"What I told you then,\n"+
		"I hope I shall have leisure to make good;\n"+
		"If this be not a dream I see and hear.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"That is the chain, sir, which you had of me.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"I think it be, sir; I deny it not.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"And you, sir, for this chain arrested me.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"I think I did, sir; I deny it not.\n"+
		"ADRIANA\n"+
		"I sent you money, sir, to be your bail,\n"+
		"By Dromio; but I think he brought it not.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"No, none by me.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"This purse of ducats I received from you,\n"+
		"And Dromio, my man, did bring them me.\n"+
		"I see we still did meet each other's man,\n"+
		"And I was ta'en for him, and he for me,\n"+
		"And thereupon these errors are arose.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"These ducats pawn I for my father here.\n"+
		"DUKE SOLINUS\n"+
		"It shall not need; thy father hath his life.\n"+
		"Courtezan\n"+
		"Sir, I must have that diamond from you.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"There, take it; and much thanks for my good cheer.\n"+
		"AEMELIA\n"+
		"Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains\n"+
		"To go with us into the abbey here\n"+
		"And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes:\n"+
		"And all that are assembled in this place,\n"+
		"That by this sympathized one day's error\n"+
		"Have suffer'd wrong, go keep us company,\n"+
		"And we shall make full satisfaction.\n"+
		"Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail\n"+
		"Of you, my sons; and till this present hour\n"+
		"My heavy burden ne'er delivered.\n"+
		"The duke, my husband and my children both,\n"+
		"And you the calendars of their nativity,\n"+
		"Go to a gossips' feast and go with me;\n"+
		"After so long grief, such festivity!\n"+
		"DUKE SOLINUS\n"+
		"With all my heart, I'll gossip at this feast.\n"+
		"Exeunt all but Antipholus of Syracuse, Antipholus of Ephesus, Dromio of Syracuse and Dromio of Ephesus\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Master, shall I fetch your stuff from shipboard?\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embark'd?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Your goods that lay at host, sir, in the Centaur.\n"+
		"ANTIPHOLUS\n"+
		"OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"He speaks to me. I am your master, Dromio:\n"+
		"Come, go with us; we'll look to that anon:\n"+
		"Embrace thy brother there; rejoice with him.\n"+
		"Exeunt Antipholus of Syracuse and Antipholus of Ephesus\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"There is a fat friend at your master's house,\n"+
		"That kitchen'd me for you to-day at dinner:\n"+
		"She now shall be my sister, not my wife.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Methinks you are my glass, and not my brother:\n"+
		"I see by you I am a sweet-faced youth.\n"+
		"Will you walk in to see their gossiping?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"Not I, sir; you are my elder.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"That's a question: how shall we try it?\n"+
		"DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n"+
		"We'll draw cuts for the senior: till then lead thou first.\n"+
		"DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n"+
		"Nay, then, thus:\n"+
		"We came into the world like brother and brother;\n"+
		"And now let's go hand in hand, not one before another.\n"+
