		"The Life and Death of Richard the Second\n"+
		"ACT I\n"+
		"SCENE I. London. KING RICHARD II's palace.\n"+
		"Enter KING RICHARD II, JOHN OF GAUNT, with other Nobles and Attendants\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Old John of Gaunt, time-honour'd Lancaster,\n"+
		"Hast thou, according to thy oath and band,\n"+
		"Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son,\n"+
		"Here to make good the boisterous late appeal,\n"+
		"Which then our leisure would not let us hear,\n"+
		"Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?\n"+
		"JOHN OF GAUNT\n"+
		"I have, my liege.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him,\n"+
		"If he appeal the duke on ancient malice;\n"+
		"Or worthily, as a good subject should,\n"+
		"On some known ground of treachery in him?\n"+
		"JOHN OF GAUNT\n"+
		"As near as I could sift him on that argument,\n"+
		"On some apparent danger seen in him\n"+
		"Aim'd at your highness, no inveterate malice.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Then call them to our presence; face to face,\n"+
		"And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear\n"+
		"The accuser and the accused freely speak:\n"+
		"High-stomach'd are they both, and full of ire,\n"+
		"In rage deaf as the sea, hasty as fire.\n"+
		"Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE and THOMAS MOWBRAY\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"Many years of happy days befal\n"+
		"My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege!\n"+
		"THOMAS MOWBRAY\n"+
		"Each day still better other's happiness;\n"+
		"Until the heavens, envying earth's good hap,\n"+
		"Add an immortal title to your crown!\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"We thank you both: yet one but flatters us,\n"+
		"As well appeareth by the cause you come;\n"+
		"Namely to appeal each other of high treason.\n"+
		"Cousin of Hereford, what dost thou object\n"+
		"Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"First, heaven be the record to my speech!\n"+
		"In the devotion of a subject's love,\n"+
		"Tendering the precious safety of my prince,\n"+
		"And free from other misbegotten hate,\n"+
		"Come I appellant to this princely presence.\n"+
		"Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,\n"+
		"And mark my greeting well; for what I speak\n"+
		"My body shall make good upon this earth,\n"+
		"Or my divine soul answer it in heaven.\n"+
		"Thou art a traitor and a miscreant,\n"+
		"Too good to be so and too bad to live,\n"+
		"Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,\n"+
		"The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.\n"+
		"Once more, the more to aggravate the note,\n"+
		"With a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat;\n"+
		"And wish, so please my sovereign, ere I move,\n"+
		"What my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove.\n"+
		"THOMAS MOWBRAY\n"+
		"Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal:\n"+
		"'Tis not the trial of a woman's war,\n"+
		"The bitter clamour of two eager tongues,\n"+
		"Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain;\n"+
		"The blood is hot that must be cool'd for this:\n"+
		"Yet can I not of such tame patience boast\n"+
		"As to be hush'd and nought at all to say:\n"+
		"First, the fair reverence of your highness curbs me\n"+
		"From giving reins and spurs to my free speech;\n"+
		"Which else would post until it had return'd\n"+
		"These terms of treason doubled down his throat.\n"+
		"Setting aside his high blood's royalty,\n"+
		"And let him be no kinsman to my liege,\n"+
		"I do defy him, and I spit at him;\n"+
		"Call him a slanderous coward and a villain:\n"+
		"Which to maintain I would allow him odds,\n"+
		"And meet him, were I tied to run afoot\n"+
		"Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps,\n"+
		"Or any other ground inhabitable,\n"+
		"Where ever Englishman durst set his foot.\n"+
		"Mean time let this defend my loyalty,\n"+
		"By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie.\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage,\n"+
		"Disclaiming here the kindred of the king,\n"+
		"And lay aside my high blood's royalty,\n"+
		"Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except.\n"+
		"If guilty dread have left thee so much strength\n"+
		"As to take up mine honour's pawn, then stoop:\n"+
		"By that and all the rites of knighthood else,\n"+
		"Will I make good against thee, arm to arm,\n"+
		"What I have spoke, or thou canst worse devise.\n"+
		"THOMAS MOWBRAY\n"+
		"I take it up; and by that sword I swear\n"+
		"Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder,\n"+
		"I'll answer thee in any fair degree,\n"+
		"Or chivalrous design of knightly trial:\n"+
		"And when I mount, alive may I not light,\n"+
		"If I be traitor or unjustly fight!\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray's charge?\n"+
		"It must be great that can inherit us\n"+
		"So much as of a thought of ill in him.\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"Look, what I speak, my life shall prove it true;\n"+
		"That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles\n"+
		"In name of lendings for your highness' soldiers,\n"+
		"The which he hath detain'd for lewd employments,\n"+
		"Like a false traitor and injurious villain.\n"+
		"Besides I say and will in battle prove,\n"+
		"Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge\n"+
		"That ever was survey'd by English eye,\n"+
		"That all the treasons for these eighteen years\n"+
		"Complotted and contrived in this land\n"+
		"Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.\n"+
		"Further I say and further will maintain\n"+
		"Upon his bad life to make all this good,\n"+
		"That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's death,\n"+
		"Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,\n"+
		"And consequently, like a traitor coward,\n"+
		"Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood:\n"+
		"Which blood, like sacrificing Abel's, cries,\n"+
		"Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth,\n"+
		"To me for justice and rough chastisement;\n"+
		"And, by the glorious worth of my descent,\n"+
		"This arm shall do it, or this life be spent.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"How high a pitch his resolution soars!\n"+
		"Thomas of Norfolk, what say'st thou to this?\n"+
		"THOMAS MOWBRAY\n"+
		"O, let my sovereign turn away his face\n"+
		"And bid his ears a little while be deaf,\n"+
		"Till I have told this slander of his blood,\n"+
		"How God and good men hate so foul a liar.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears:\n"+
		"Were he my brother, nay, my kingdom's heir,\n"+
		"As he is but my father's brother's son,\n"+
		"Now, by my sceptre's awe, I make a vow,\n"+
		"Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood\n"+
		"Should nothing privilege him, nor partialize\n"+
		"The unstooping firmness of my upright soul:\n"+
		"He is our subject, Mowbray; so art thou:\n"+
		"Free speech and fearless I to thee allow.\n"+
		"THOMAS MOWBRAY\n"+
		"Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,\n"+
		"Through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest.\n"+
		"Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais\n"+
		"Disbursed I duly to his highness' soldiers;\n"+
		"The other part reserved I by consent,\n"+
		"For that my sovereign liege was in my debt\n"+
		"Upon remainder of a dear account,\n"+
		"Since last I went to France to fetch his queen:\n"+
		"Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester's death,\n"+
		"I slew him not; but to my own disgrace\n"+
		"Neglected my sworn duty in that case.\n"+
		"For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,\n"+
		"The honourable father to my foe\n"+
		"Once did I lay an ambush for your life,\n"+
		"A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul\n"+
		"But ere I last received the sacrament\n"+
		"I did confess it, and exactly begg'd\n"+
		"Your grace's pardon, and I hope I had it.\n"+
		"This is my fault: as for the rest appeall'd,\n"+
		"It issues from the rancour of a villain,\n"+
		"A recreant and most degenerate traitor\n"+
		"Which in myself I boldly will defend;\n"+
		"And interchangeably hurl down my gage\n"+
		"Upon this overweening traitor's foot,\n"+
		"To prove myself a loyal gentleman\n"+
		"Even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom.\n"+
		"In haste whereof, most heartily I pray\n"+
		"Your highness to assign our trial day.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Wrath-kindled gentlemen, be ruled by me;\n"+
		"Let's purge this choler without letting blood:\n"+
		"This we prescribe, though no physician;\n"+
		"Deep malice makes too deep incision;\n"+
		"Forget, forgive; conclude and be agreed;\n"+
		"Our doctors say this is no month to bleed.\n"+
		"Good uncle, let this end where it begun;\n"+
		"We'll calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your son.\n"+
		"JOHN OF GAUNT\n"+
		"To be a make-peace shall become my age:\n"+
		"Throw down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk's gage.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"And, Norfolk, throw down his.\n"+
		"JOHN OF GAUNT\n"+
		"When, Harry, when?\n"+
		"Obedience bids I should not bid again.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Norfolk, throw down, we bid; there is no boot.\n"+
		"THOMAS MOWBRAY\n"+
		"Myself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot.\n"+
		"My life thou shalt command, but not my shame:\n"+
		"The one my duty owes; but my fair name,\n"+
		"Despite of death that lives upon my grave,\n"+
		"To dark dishonour's use thou shalt not have.\n"+
		"I am disgraced, impeach'd and baffled here,\n"+
		"Pierced to the soul with slander's venom'd spear,\n"+
		"The which no balm can cure but his heart-blood\n"+
		"Which breathed this poison.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Rage must be withstood:\n"+
		"Give me his gage: lions make leopards tame.\n"+
		"THOMAS MOWBRAY\n"+
		"Yea, but not change his spots: take but my shame.\n"+
		"And I resign my gage. My dear dear lord,\n"+
		"The purest treasure mortal times afford\n"+
		"Is spotless reputation: that away,\n"+
		"Men are but gilded loam or painted clay.\n"+
		"A jewel in a ten-times-barr'd-up chest\n"+
		"Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast.\n"+
		"Mine honour is my life; both grow in one:\n"+
		"Take honour from me, and my life is done:\n"+
		"Then, dear my liege, mine honour let me try;\n"+
		"In that I live and for that will I die.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Cousin, throw up your gage; do you begin.\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"O, God defend my soul from such deep sin!\n"+
		"Shall I seem crest-fall'n in my father's sight?\n"+
		"Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height\n"+
		"Before this out-dared dastard? Ere my tongue\n"+
		"Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong,\n"+
		"Or sound so base a parle, my teeth shall tear\n"+
		"The slavish motive of recanting fear,\n"+
		"And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,\n"+
		"Where shame doth harbour, even in Mowbray's face.\n"+
		"Exit JOHN OF GAUNT\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"We were not born to sue, but to command;\n"+
		"Which since we cannot do to make you friends,\n"+
		"Be ready, as your lives shall answer it,\n"+
		"At Coventry, upon Saint Lambert's day:\n"+
		"There shall your swords and lances arbitrate\n"+
		"The swelling difference of your settled hate:\n"+
		"Since we can not atone you, we shall see\n"+
		"Justice design the victor's chivalry.\n"+
		"Lord marshal, command our officers at arms\n"+
		"Be ready to direct these home alarms.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. The DUKE OF LANCASTER'S palace.\n"+
		"Enter JOHN OF GAUNT with DUCHESS\n"+
		"JOHN OF GAUNT\n"+
		"Alas, the part I had in Woodstock's blood\n"+
		"Doth more solicit me than your exclaims,\n"+
		"To stir against the butchers of his life!\n"+
		"But since correction lieth in those hands\n"+
		"Which made the fault that we cannot correct,\n"+
		"Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven;\n"+
		"Who, when they see the hours ripe on earth,\n"+
		"Will rain hot vengeance on offenders' heads.\n"+
		"DUCHESS\n"+
		"Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?\n"+
		"Hath love in thy old blood no living fire?\n"+
		"Edward's seven sons, whereof thyself art one,\n"+
		"Were as seven vials of his sacred blood,\n"+
		"Or seven fair branches springing from one root:\n"+
		"Some of those seven are dried by nature's course,\n"+
		"Some of those branches by the Destinies cut;\n"+
		"But Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my Gloucester,\n"+
		"One vial full of Edward's sacred blood,\n"+
		"One flourishing branch of his most royal root,\n"+
		"Is crack'd, and all the precious liquor spilt,\n"+
		"Is hack'd down, and his summer leaves all faded,\n"+
		"By envy's hand and murder's bloody axe.\n"+
		"Ah, Gaunt, his blood was thine! that bed, that womb,\n"+
		"That metal, that self-mould, that fashion'd thee\n"+
		"Made him a man; and though thou livest and breathest,\n"+
		"Yet art thou slain in him: thou dost consent\n"+
		"In some large measure to thy father's death,\n"+
		"In that thou seest thy wretched brother die,\n"+
		"Who was the model of thy father's life.\n"+
		"Call it not patience, Gaunt; it is despair:\n"+
		"In suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter'd,\n"+
		"Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life,\n"+
		"Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee:\n"+
		"That which in mean men we intitle patience\n"+
		"Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.\n"+
		"What shall I say? to safeguard thine own life,\n"+
		"The best way is to venge my Gloucester's death.\n"+
		"JOHN OF GAUNT\n"+
		"God's is the quarrel; for God's substitute,\n"+
		"His deputy anointed in His sight,\n"+
		"Hath caused his death: the which if wrongfully,\n"+
		"Let heaven revenge; for I may never lift\n"+
		"An angry arm against His minister.\n"+
		"DUCHESS\n"+
		"Where then, alas, may I complain myself?\n"+
		"JOHN OF GAUNT\n"+
		"To God, the widow's champion and defence.\n"+
		"DUCHESS\n"+
		"Why, then, I will. Farewell, old Gaunt.\n"+
		"Thou goest to Coventry, there to behold\n"+
		"Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight:\n"+
		"O, sit my husband's wrongs on Hereford's spear,\n"+
		"That it may enter butcher Mowbray's breast!\n"+
		"Or, if misfortune miss the first career,\n"+
		"Be Mowbray's sins so heavy in his bosom,\n"+
		"They may break his foaming courser's back,\n"+
		"And throw the rider headlong in the lists,\n"+
		"A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford!\n"+
		"Farewell, old Gaunt: thy sometimes brother's wife\n"+
		"With her companion grief must end her life.\n"+
		"JOHN OF GAUNT\n"+
		"Sister, farewell; I must to Coventry:\n"+
		"As much good stay with thee as go with me!\n"+
		"DUCHESS\n"+
		"Yet one word more: grief boundeth where it falls,\n"+
		"Not with the empty hollowness, but weight:\n"+
		"I take my leave before I have begun,\n"+
		"For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done.\n"+
		"Commend me to thy brother, Edmund York.\n"+
		"Lo, this is all:--nay, yet depart not so;\n"+
		"Though this be all, do not so quickly go;\n"+
		"I shall remember more. Bid him--ah, what?--\n"+
		"With all good speed at Plashy visit me.\n"+
		"Alack, and what shall good old York there see\n"+
		"But empty lodgings and unfurnish'd walls,\n"+
		"Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?\n"+
		"And what hear there for welcome but my groans?\n"+
		"Therefore commend me; let him not come there,\n"+
		"To seek out sorrow that dwells every where.\n"+
		"Desolate, desolate, will I hence and die:\n"+
		"The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. The lists at Coventry.\n"+
		"Enter the Lord Marshal and the DUKE OF AUMERLE\n"+
		"Lord Marshal\n"+
		"My Lord Aumerle, is Harry Hereford arm'd?\n"+
		"DUKE OF AUMERLE\n"+
		"Yea, at all points; and longs to enter in.\n"+
		"Lord Marshal\n"+
		"The Duke of Norfolk, sprightfully and bold,\n"+
		"Stays but the summons of the appellant's trumpet.\n"+
		"DUKE OF AUMERLE\n"+
		"Why, then, the champions are prepared, and stay\n"+
		"For nothing but his majesty's approach.\n"+
		"The trumpets sound, and KING RICHARD enters with his nobles, JOHN OF GAUNT, BUSHY, BAGOT, GREEN, and others. When they are set, enter THOMAS MOWBRAY in arms, defendant, with a Herald\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Marshal, demand of yonder champion\n"+
		"The cause of his arrival here in arms:\n"+
		"Ask him his name and orderly proceed\n"+
		"To swear him in the justice of his cause.\n"+
		"Lord Marshal\n"+
		"In God's name and the king's, say who thou art\n"+
		"And why thou comest thus knightly clad in arms,\n"+
		"Against what man thou comest, and what thy quarrel:\n"+
		"Speak truly, on thy knighthood and thy oath;\n"+
		"As so defend thee heaven and thy valour!\n"+
		"THOMAS MOWBRAY\n"+
		"My name is Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk;\n"+
		"Who hither come engaged by my oath--\n"+
		"Which God defend a knight should violate!--\n"+
		"Both to defend my loyalty and truth\n"+
		"To God, my king and my succeeding issue,\n"+
		"Against the Duke of Hereford that appeals me\n"+
		"And, by the grace of God and this mine arm,\n"+
		"To prove him, in defending of myself,\n"+
		"A traitor to my God, my king, and me:\n"+
		"And as I truly fight, defend me heaven!\n"+
		"The trumpets sound. Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE, appellant, in armour, with a Herald\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Marshal, ask yonder knight in arms,\n"+
		"Both who he is and why he cometh hither\n"+
		"Thus plated in habiliments of war,\n"+
		"And formally, according to our law,\n"+
		"Depose him in the justice of his cause.\n"+
		"Lord Marshal\n"+
		"What is thy name? and wherefore comest thou hither,\n"+
		"Before King Richard in his royal lists?\n"+
		"Against whom comest thou? and what's thy quarrel?\n"+
		"Speak like a true knight, so defend thee heaven!\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby\n"+
		"Am I; who ready here do stand in arms,\n"+
		"To prove, by God's grace and my body's valour,\n"+
		"In lists, on Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,\n"+
		"That he is a traitor, foul and dangerous,\n"+
		"To God of heaven, King Richard and to me;\n"+
		"And as I truly fight, defend me heaven!\n"+
		"Lord Marshal\n"+
		"On pain of death, no person be so bold\n"+
		"Or daring-hardy as to touch the lists,\n"+
		"Except the marshal and such officers\n"+
		"Appointed to direct these fair designs.\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"Lord marshal, let me kiss my sovereign's hand,\n"+
		"And bow my knee before his majesty:\n"+
		"For Mowbray and myself are like two men\n"+
		"That vow a long and weary pilgrimage;\n"+
		"Then let us take a ceremonious leave\n"+
		"And loving farewell of our several friends.\n"+
		"Lord Marshal\n"+
		"The appellant in all duty greets your highness,\n"+
		"And craves to kiss your hand and take his leave.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"We will descend and fold him in our arms.\n"+
		"Cousin of Hereford, as thy cause is right,\n"+
		"So be thy fortune in this royal fight!\n"+
		"Farewell, my blood; which if to-day thou shed,\n"+
		"Lament we may, but not revenge thee dead.\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"O let no noble eye profane a tear\n"+
		"For me, if I be gored with Mowbray's spear:\n"+
		"As confident as is the falcon's flight\n"+
		"Against a bird, do I with Mowbray fight.\n"+
		"My loving lord, I take my leave of you;\n"+
		"Of you, my noble cousin, Lord Aumerle;\n"+
		"Not sick, although I have to do with death,\n"+
		"But lusty, young, and cheerly drawing breath.\n"+
		"Lo, as at English feasts, so I regreet\n"+
		"The daintiest last, to make the end most sweet:\n"+
		"O thou, the earthly author of my blood,\n"+
		"Whose youthful spirit, in me regenerate,\n"+
		"Doth with a twofold vigour lift me up\n"+
		"To reach at victory above my head,\n"+
		"Add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers;\n"+
		"And with thy blessings steel my lance's point,\n"+
		"That it may enter Mowbray's waxen coat,\n"+
		"And furbish new the name of John a Gaunt,\n"+
		"Even in the lusty havior of his son.\n"+
		"JOHN OF GAUNT\n"+
		"God in thy good cause make thee prosperous!\n"+
		"Be swift like lightning in the execution;\n"+
		"And let thy blows, doubly redoubled,\n"+
		"Fall like amazing thunder on the casque\n"+
		"Of thy adverse pernicious enemy:\n"+
		"Rouse up thy youthful blood, be valiant and live.\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"Mine innocency and Saint George to thrive!\n"+
		"THOMAS MOWBRAY\n"+
		"However God or fortune cast my lot,\n"+
		"There lives or dies, true to King Richard's throne,\n"+
		"A loyal, just and upright gentleman:\n"+
		"Never did captive with a freer heart\n"+
		"Cast off his chains of bondage and embrace\n"+
		"His golden uncontroll'd enfranchisement,\n"+
		"More than my dancing soul doth celebrate\n"+
		"This feast of battle with mine adversary.\n"+
		"Most mighty liege, and my companion peers,\n"+
		"Take from my mouth the wish of happy years:\n"+
		"As gentle and as jocund as to jest\n"+
		"Go I to fight: truth hath a quiet breast.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Farewell, my lord: securely I espy\n"+
		"Virtue with valour couched in thine eye.\n"+
		"Order the trial, marshal, and begin.\n"+
		"Lord Marshal\n"+
		"Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby,\n"+
		"Receive thy lance; and God defend the right!\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"Strong as a tower in hope, I cry amen.\n"+
		"Lord Marshal\n"+
		"Go bear this lance to Thomas, Duke of Norfolk.\n"+
		"First Herald\n"+
		"Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby,\n"+
		"Stands here for God, his sovereign and himself,\n"+
		"On pain to be found false and recreant,\n"+
		"To prove the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray,\n"+
		"A traitor to his God, his king and him;\n"+
		"And dares him to set forward to the fight.\n"+
		"Second Herald\n"+
		"Here standeth Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,\n"+
		"On pain to be found false and recreant,\n"+
		"Both to defend himself and to approve\n"+
		"Henry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby,\n"+
		"To God, his sovereign and to him disloyal;\n"+
		"Courageously and with a free desire\n"+
		"Attending but the signal to begin.\n"+
		"Lord Marshal\n"+
		"Sound, trumpets; and set forward, combatants.\n"+
		"A charge sounded\n"+
		"Stay, the king hath thrown his warder down.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Let them lay by their helmets and their spears,\n"+
		"And both return back to their chairs again:\n"+
		"Withdraw with us: and let the trumpets sound\n"+
		"While we return these dukes what we decree.\n"+
		"A long flourish\n"+
		"Draw near,\n"+
		"And list what with our council we have done.\n"+
		"For that our kingdom's earth should not be soil'd\n"+
		"With that dear blood which it hath fostered;\n"+
		"And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect\n"+
		"Of civil wounds plough'd up with neighbours' sword;\n"+
		"And for we think the eagle-winged pride\n"+
		"Of sky-aspiring and ambitious thoughts,\n"+
		"With rival-hating envy, set on you\n"+
		"To wake our peace, which in our country's cradle\n"+
		"Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep;\n"+
		"Which so roused up with boisterous untuned drums,\n"+
		"With harsh resounding trumpets' dreadful bray,\n"+
		"And grating shock of wrathful iron arms,\n"+
		"Might from our quiet confines fright fair peace\n"+
		"And make us wade even in our kindred's blood,\n"+
		"Therefore, we banish you our territories:\n"+
		"You, cousin Hereford, upon pain of life,\n"+
		"Till twice five summers have enrich'd our fields\n"+
		"Shall not regreet our fair dominions,\n"+
		"But tread the stranger paths of banishment.\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"Your will be done: this must my comfort be,\n"+
		"Sun that warms you here shall shine on me;\n"+
		"And those his golden beams to you here lent\n"+
		"Shall point on me and gild my banishment.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Norfolk, for thee remains a heavier doom,\n"+
		"Which I with some unwillingness pronounce:\n"+
		"The sly slow hours shall not determinate\n"+
		"The dateless limit of thy dear exile;\n"+
		"The hopeless word of 'never to return'\n"+
		"Breathe I against thee, upon pain of life.\n"+
		"THOMAS MOWBRAY\n"+
		"A heavy sentence, my most sovereign liege,\n"+
		"And all unlook'd for from your highness' mouth:\n"+
		"A dearer merit, not so deep a maim\n"+
		"As to be cast forth in the common air,\n"+

		"Than an unstringed viol or a harp,\n"+
		"Or like a cunning instrument cased up,\n"+
		"Or, being open, put into his hands\n"+
		"That knows no touch to tune the harmony:\n"+
		"Within my mouth you have engaol'd my tongue,\n"+
		"Doubly portcullis'd with my teeth and lips;\n"+
		"And dull unfeeling barren ignorance\n"+
		"Is made my gaoler to attend on me.\n"+
		"I am too old to fawn upon a nurse,\n"+

		"For, ere the six years that he hath to spend\n"+
		"Can change their moons and bring their times about\n"+
		"My oil-dried lamp and time-bewasted light\n"+
		"Shall be extinct with age and endless night;\n"+

		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Why uncle, thou hast many years to live.\n"+
		"JOHN OF GAUNT\n"+
		"But not a minute, king, that thou canst give:\n"+
		"Shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow,\n"+
		"And pluck nights from me, but not lend a morrow;\n"+
		"Thou canst help time to furrow me with age,\n"+
		"But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage;\n"+
		"Thy word is current with him for my death,\n"+
		"But dead, thy kingdom cannot buy my breath.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Thy son is banish'd upon good advice,\n"+
		"Whereto thy tongue a party-verdict gave:\n"+

		"You would have bid me argue like a father.\n"+
		"O, had it been a stranger, not my child,\n"+
		"To smooth his fault I should have been more mild:\n"+
		"A partial slander sought I to avoid,\n"+
		"And in the sentence my own life destroy'd.\n"+
		"Alas, I look'd when some of you should say,\n"+
		"I was too strict to make mine own away;\n"+
		"But you gave leave to my unwilling tongue\n"+
		"Against my will to do myself this wrong.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Cousin, farewell; and, uncle, bid him so:\n"+
		"Six years we banish him, and he shall go.\n"+

		"That thou return'st no greeting to thy friends?\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"I have too few to take my leave of you,\n"+
		"When the tongue's office should be prodigal\n"+

		"To men in joy; but grief makes one hour ten.\n"+
		"JOHN OF GAUNT\n"+
		"Call it a travel that thou takest for pleasure.\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"My heart will sigh when I miscall it so,\n"+
		"Which finds it an inforced pilgrimage.\n"+
		"JOHN OF GAUNT\n"+
		"The sullen passage of thy weary steps\n"+
		"Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set\n"+
		"The precious jewel of thy home return.\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"Nay, rather, every tedious stride I make\n"+
		"Will but remember me what a deal of world\n"+
		"I wander from the jewels that I love.\n"+
		"Must I not serve a long apprenticehood\n"+
		"To foreign passages, and in the end,\n"+
		"Having my freedom, boast of nothing else\n"+
		"But that I was a journeyman to grief?\n"+
		"JOHN OF GAUNT\n"+
		"All places that the eye of heaven visits\n"+
		"Are to a wise man ports and happy havens.\n"+

		"There is no virtue like necessity.\n"+

		"But thou the king. Woe doth the heavier sit,\n"+
		"Where it perceives it is but faintly borne.\n"+
		"Go, say I sent thee forth to purchase honour\n"+
		"And not the king exiled thee; or suppose\n"+
		"Devouring pestilence hangs in our air\n"+
		"And thou art flying to a fresher clime:\n"+
		"Look, what thy soul holds dear, imagine it\n"+
		"To lie that way thou go'st, not whence thou comest:\n"+
		"Suppose the singing birds musicians,\n"+
		"The grass whereon thou tread'st the presence strew'd,\n"+
		"The flowers fair ladies, and thy steps no more\n"+
		"Than a delightful measure or a dance;\n"+
		"For gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite\n"+
		"The man that mocks at it and sets it light.\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"O, who can hold a fire in his hand\n"+
		"By thinking on the frosty Caucasus?\n"+
		"Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite\n"+
		"By bare imagination of a feast?\n"+
		"Or wallow naked in December snow\n"+
		"By thinking on fantastic summer's heat?\n"+
		"O, no! the apprehension of the good\n"+
		"Gives but the greater feeling to the worse:\n"+
		"Fell sorrow's tooth doth never rankle more\n"+
		"Than when he bites, but lanceth not the sore.\n"+
		"JOHN OF GAUNT\n"+
		"Come, come, my son, I'll bring thee on thy way:\n"+
		"Had I thy youth and cause, I would not stay.\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"Then, England's ground, farewell; sweet soil, adieu;\n"+
		"My mother, and my nurse, that bears me yet!\n"+
		"Where'er I wander, boast of this I can,\n"+
		"Though banish'd, yet a trueborn Englishman.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV. The court.\n"+
		"Enter KING RICHARD II, with BAGOT and GREEN at one door; and the DUKE OF AUMERLE at another\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"We did observe. Cousin Aumerle,\n"+
		"How far brought you high Hereford on his way?\n"+
		"DUKE OF AUMERLE\n"+
		"I brought high Hereford, if you call him so,\n"+
		"But to the next highway, and there I left him.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"And say, what store of parting tears were shed?\n"+
		"DUKE OF AUMERLE\n"+
		"Faith, none for me; except the north-east wind,\n"+
		"Which then blew bitterly against our faces,\n"+
		"Awaked the sleeping rheum, and so by chance\n"+
		"Did grace our hollow parting with a tear.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"What said our cousin when you parted with him?\n"+
		"DUKE OF AUMERLE\n"+
		"'Farewell:'\n"+
		"And, for my heart disdained that my tongue\n"+
		"Should so profane the word, that taught me craft\n"+
		"To counterfeit oppression of such grief\n"+
		"That words seem'd buried in my sorrow's grave.\n"+
		"Marry, would the word 'farewell' have lengthen'd hours\n"+
		"And added years to his short banishment,\n"+
		"He should have had a volume of farewells;\n"+
		"But since it would not, he had none of me.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"He is our cousin, cousin; but 'tis doubt,\n"+
		"When time shall call him home from banishment,\n"+
		"Whether our kinsman come to see his friends.\n"+
		"Ourself and Bushy, Bagot here and Green\n"+
		"Observed his courtship to the common people;\n"+
		"How he did seem to dive into their hearts\n"+
		"With humble and familiar courtesy,\n"+
		"What reverence he did throw away on slaves,\n"+
		"Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles\n"+
		"And patient underbearing of his fortune,\n"+
		"As 'twere to banish their affects with him.\n"+
		"Off goes his bonnet to an oyster-wench;\n"+
		"A brace of draymen bid God speed him well\n"+
		"And had the tribute of his supple knee,\n"+
		"With 'Thanks, my countrymen, my loving friends;'\n"+
		"As were our England in reversion his,\n"+
		"And he our subjects' next degree in hope.\n"+
		"GREEN\n"+
		"Well, he is gone; and with him go these thoughts.\n"+
		"Now for the rebels which stand out in Ireland,\n"+
		"Expedient manage must be made, my liege,\n"+
		"Ere further leisure yield them further means\n"+
		"For their advantage and your highness' loss.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"We will ourself in person to this war:\n"+
		"And, for our coffers, with too great a court\n"+
		"And liberal largess, are grown somewhat light,\n"+
		"We are inforced to farm our royal realm;\n"+
		"The revenue whereof shall furnish us\n"+
		"For our affairs in hand: if that come short,\n"+
		"Our substitutes at home shall have blank charters;\n"+
		"Whereto, when they shall know what men are rich,\n"+
		"They shall subscribe them for large sums of gold\n"+
		"And send them after to supply our wants;\n"+
		"For we will make for Ireland presently.\n"+
		"Enter BUSHY\n"+
		"Bushy, what news?\n"+
		"BUSHY\n"+
		"Old John of Gaunt is grievous sick, my lord,\n"+
		"Suddenly taken; and hath sent post haste\n"+
		"To entreat your majesty to visit him.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Where lies he?\n"+
		"BUSHY\n"+
		"At Ely House.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Now put it, God, in the physician's mind\n"+
		"To help him to his grave immediately!\n"+
		"The lining of his coffers shall make coats\n"+
		"To deck our soldiers for these Irish wars.\n"+
		"Come, gentlemen, let's all go visit him:\n"+
		"Pray God we may make haste, and come too late!\n"+
		"All\n"+
		"Amen.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT II\n"+
		"SCENE I. Ely House.\n"+
		"Enter JOHN OF GAUNT sick, with the DUKE OF YORK, & c\n"+
		"JOHN OF GAUNT\n"+
		"Will the king come, that I may breathe my last\n"+
		"In wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth?\n"+
		"DUKE OF YORK\n"+
		"Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;\n"+
		"For all in vain comes counsel to his ear.\n"+
		"JOHN OF GAUNT\n"+
		"O, but they say the tongues of dying men\n"+
		"Enforce attention like deep harmony:\n"+
		"Where words are scarce, they are seldom spent in vain,\n"+
		"For they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain.\n"+
		"He that no more must say is listen'd more\n"+
		"Than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose;\n"+
		"More are men's ends mark'd than their lives before:\n"+
		"The setting sun, and music at the close,\n"+
		"As the last taste of sweets, is sweetest last,\n"+
		"Writ in remembrance more than things long past:\n"+
		"Though Richard my life's counsel would not hear,\n"+
		"My death's sad tale may yet undeaf his ear.\n"+
		"DUKE OF YORK\n"+
		"No; it is stopp'd with other flattering sounds,\n"+
		"As praises, of whose taste the wise are fond,\n"+
		"Lascivious metres, to whose venom sound\n"+
		"The open ear of youth doth always listen;\n"+
		"Report of fashions in proud Italy,\n"+
		"Whose manners still our tardy apish nation\n"+
		"Limps after in base imitation.\n"+
		"Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity--\n"+
		"So it be new, there's no respect how vile--\n"+
		"That is not quickly buzzed into his ears?\n"+
		"Then all too late comes counsel to be heard,\n"+
		"Where will doth mutiny with wit's regard.\n"+
		"Direct not him whose way himself will choose:\n"+
		"'Tis breath thou lack'st, and that breath wilt thou lose.\n"+
		"JOHN OF GAUNT\n"+
		"Methinks I am a prophet new inspired\n"+
		"And thus expiring do foretell of him:\n"+
		"His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,\n"+
		"For violent fires soon burn out themselves;\n"+
		"Small showers last long, but sudden storms are short;\n"+
		"He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes;\n"+
		"With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder:\n"+
		"Light vanity, insatiate cormorant,\n"+
		"Consuming means, soon preys upon itself.\n"+
		"This royal throne of kings, this scepter'd isle,\n"+
		"This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,\n"+
		"This other Eden, demi-paradise,\n"+
		"This fortress built by Nature for herself\n"+
		"Against infection and the hand of war,\n"+
		"This happy breed of men, this little world,\n"+
		"This precious stone set in the silver sea,\n"+
		"Which serves it in the office of a wall,\n"+
		"Or as a moat defensive to a house,\n"+
		"Against the envy of less happier lands,\n"+
		"This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England,\n"+
		"This nurse, this teeming womb of royal kings,\n"+
		"Fear'd by their breed and famous by their birth,\n"+
		"Renowned for their deeds as far from home,\n"+
		"For Christian service and true chivalry,\n"+
		"As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry,\n"+
		"Of the world's ransom, blessed Mary's Son,\n"+
		"This land of such dear souls, this dear dear land,\n"+
		"Dear for her reputation through the world,\n"+
		"Is now leased out, I die pronouncing it,\n"+
		"Like to a tenement or pelting farm:\n"+
		"England, bound in with the triumphant sea\n"+
		"Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege\n"+
		"Of watery Neptune, is now bound in with shame,\n"+
		"With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds:\n"+
		"That England, that was wont to conquer others,\n"+
		"Hath made a shameful conquest of itself.\n"+
		"Ah, would the scandal vanish with my life,\n"+
		"How happy then were my ensuing death!\n"+
		"Enter KING RICHARD II and QUEEN, DUKE OF AUMERLE, BUSHY, GREEN, BAGOT, LORD ROSS, and LORD WILLOUGHBY\n"+
		"DUKE OF YORK\n"+
		"The king is come: deal mildly with his youth;\n"+
		"For young hot colts being raged do rage the more.\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"How fares our noble uncle, Lancaster?\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"What comfort, man? how is't with aged Gaunt?\n"+
		"JOHN OF GAUNT\n"+
		"O how that name befits my composition!\n"+
		"Old Gaunt indeed, and gaunt in being old:\n"+
		"Within me grief hath kept a tedious fast;\n"+
		"And who abstains from meat that is not gaunt?\n"+
		"For sleeping England long time have I watch'd;\n"+
		"Watching breeds leanness, leanness is all gaunt:\n"+
		"The pleasure that some fathers feed upon,\n"+
		"Is my strict fast; I mean, my children's looks;\n"+
		"And therein fasting, hast thou made me gaunt:\n"+
		"Gaunt am I for the grave, gaunt as a grave,\n"+
		"Whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Can sick men play so nicely with their names?\n"+
		"JOHN OF GAUNT\n"+
		"No, misery makes sport to mock itself:\n"+
		"Since thou dost seek to kill my name in me,\n"+
		"I mock my name, great king, to flatter thee.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Should dying men flatter with those that live?\n"+
		"JOHN OF GAUNT\n"+
		"No, no, men living flatter those that die.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Thou, now a-dying, say'st thou flatterest me.\n"+
		"JOHN OF GAUNT\n"+
		"O, no! thou diest, though I the sicker be.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"I am in health, I breathe, and see thee ill.\n"+
		"JOHN OF GAUNT\n"+
		"Now He that made me knows I see thee ill;\n"+
		"Ill in myself to see, and in thee seeing ill.\n"+
		"Thy death-bed is no lesser than thy land\n"+
		"Wherein thou liest in reputation sick;\n"+
		"And thou, too careless patient as thou art,\n"+
		"Commit'st thy anointed body to the cure\n"+
		"Of those physicians that first wounded thee:\n"+
		"A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown,\n"+
		"Whose compass is no bigger than thy head;\n"+
		"And yet, incaged in so small a verge,\n"+
		"The waste is no whit lesser than thy land.\n"+
		"O, had thy grandsire with a prophet's eye\n"+
		"Seen how his son's son should destroy his sons,\n"+
		"From forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame,\n"+
		"Deposing thee before thou wert possess'd,\n"+
		"Which art possess'd now to depose thyself.\n"+
		"Why, cousin, wert thou regent of the world,\n"+
		"It were a shame to let this land by lease;\n"+
		"But for thy world enjoying but this land,\n"+
		"Is it not more than shame to shame it so?\n"+
		"Landlord of England art thou now, not king:\n"+
		"Thy state of law is bondslave to the law; And thou--\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"A lunatic lean-witted fool,\n"+
		"Presuming on an ague's privilege,\n"+
		"Darest with thy frozen admonition\n"+
		"Make pale our cheek, chasing the royal blood\n"+
		"With fury from his native residence.\n"+
		"Now, by my seat's right royal majesty,\n"+
		"Wert thou not brother to great Edward's son,\n"+
		"This tongue that runs so roundly in thy head\n"+
		"Should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders.\n"+
		"JOHN OF GAUNT\n"+
		"O, spare me not, my brother Edward's son,\n"+
		"For that I was his father Edward's son;\n"+
		"That blood already, like the pelican,\n"+
		"Hast thou tapp'd out and drunkenly caroused:\n"+
		"My brother Gloucester, plain well-meaning soul,\n"+
		"Whom fair befal in heaven 'mongst happy souls!\n"+
		"May be a precedent and witness good\n"+
		"That thou respect'st not spilling Edward's blood:\n"+
		"Join with the present sickness that I have;\n"+
		"And thy unkindness be like crooked age,\n"+
		"To crop at once a too long wither'd flower.\n"+
		"Live in thy shame, but die not shame with thee!\n"+
		"These words hereafter thy tormentors be!\n"+
		"Convey me to my bed, then to my grave:\n"+
		"Love they to live that love and honour have.\n"+
		"Exit, borne off by his Attendants\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"And let them die that age and sullens have;\n"+
		"For both hast thou, and both become the grave.\n"+
		"DUKE OF YORK\n"+
		"I do beseech your majesty, impute his words\n"+
		"To wayward sickliness and age in him:\n"+
		"He loves you, on my life, and holds you dear\n"+
		"As Harry Duke of Hereford, were he here.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Right, you say true: as Hereford's love, so his;\n"+
		"As theirs, so mine; and all be as it is.\n"+
		"Enter NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"My liege, old Gaunt commends him to your majesty.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"What says he?\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"Nay, nothing; all is said\n"+
		"His tongue is now a stringless instrument;\n"+
		"Words, life and all, old Lancaster hath spent.\n"+
		"DUKE OF YORK\n"+
		"Be York the next that must be bankrupt so!\n"+
		"Though death be poor, it ends a mortal woe.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"The ripest fruit first falls, and so doth he;\n"+
		"His time is spent, our pilgrimage must be.\n"+
		"So much for that. Now for our Irish wars:\n"+
		"We must supplant those rough rug-headed kerns,\n"+
		"Which live like venom where no venom else\n"+
		"But only they have privilege to live.\n"+
		"And for these great affairs do ask some charge,\n"+
		"Towards our assistance we do seize to us\n"+
		"The plate, corn, revenues and moveables,\n"+
		"Whereof our uncle Gaunt did stand possess'd.\n"+
		"DUKE OF YORK\n"+
		"How long shall I be patient? ah, how long\n"+
		"Shall tender duty make me suffer wrong?\n"+
		"Not Gloucester's death, nor Hereford's banishment\n"+
		"Not Gaunt's rebukes, nor England's private wrongs,\n"+
		"Nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke\n"+
		"About his marriage, nor my own disgrace,\n"+
		"Have ever made me sour my patient cheek,\n"+
		"Or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign's face.\n"+
		"I am the last of noble Edward's sons,\n"+
		"Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, was first:\n"+
		"In war was never lion raged more fierce,\n"+
		"In peace was never gentle lamb more mild,\n"+
		"Than was that young and princely gentleman.\n"+
		"His face thou hast, for even so look'd he,\n"+
		"Accomplish'd with the number of thy hours;\n"+
		"But when he frown'd, it was against the French\n"+
		"And not against his friends; his noble hand\n"+
		"Did will what he did spend and spent not that\n"+
		"Which his triumphant father's hand had won;\n"+
		"His hands were guilty of no kindred blood,\n"+
		"But bloody with the enemies of his kin.\n"+
		"O Richard! York is too far gone with grief,\n"+
		"Or else he never would compare between.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Why, uncle, what's the matter?\n"+
		"DUKE OF YORK\n"+
		"O my liege,\n"+
		"Pardon me, if you please; if n ot, I, pleased\n"+
		"Not to be pardon'd, am content withal.\n"+
		"Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands\n"+
		"The royalties and rights of banish'd Hereford?\n"+
		"Is not Gaunt dead, and doth not Hereford live?\n"+
		"Was not Gaunt just, and is not Harry true?\n"+
		"Did not the one deserve to have an heir?\n"+

		"His livery, and deny his offer'd homage,\n"+
		"You pluck a thousand dangers on your head,\n"+
		"You lose a thousand well-disposed hearts\n"+

		"Our uncle York lord governor of England;\n"+
		"For he is just and always loved us well.\n"+
		"Come on, our queen: to-morrow must we part;\n"+
		"Be merry, for our time of stay is short\n"+
		"Flourish. Exeunt KING RICHARD II, QUEEN, DUKE OF AUMERLE, BUSHY, GREEN, and BAGOT\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"Well, lords, the Duke of Lancaster is dead.\n"+
		"LORD ROSS\n"+
		"And living too; for now his son is duke.\n"+
		"LORD WILLOUGHBY\n"+
		"Barely in title, not in revenue.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"Richly in both, if justice had her right.\n"+
		"LORD ROSS\n"+
		"My heart is great; but it must break with silence,\n"+
		"Ere't be disburden'd with a liberal tongue.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"Nay, speak thy mind; and let him ne'er speak more\n"+
		"That speaks thy words again to do thee harm!\n"+
		"LORD WILLOUGHBY\n"+
		"Tends that thou wouldst speak to the Duke of Hereford?\n"+
		"If it be so, out with it boldly, man;\n"+
		"Quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him.\n"+
		"LORD ROSS\n"+
		"No good at all that I can do for him;\n"+
		"Unless you call it good to pity him,\n"+
		"Bereft and gelded of his patrimony.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"Now, afore God, 'tis shame such wrongs are borne\n"+
		"In him, a royal prince, and many moe\n"+
		"Of noble blood in this declining land.\n"+
		"The king is not himself, but basely led\n"+
		"By flatterers; and what they will inform,\n"+
		"Merely in hate, 'gainst any of us all,\n"+
		"That will the king severely prosecute\n"+
		"'Gainst us, our lives, our children, and our heirs.\n"+
		"LORD ROSS\n"+
		"The commons hath he pill'd with grievous taxes,\n"+
		"And quite lost their hearts: the nobles hath he fined\n"+
		"For ancient quarrels, and quite lost their hearts.\n"+
		"LORD WILLOUGHBY\n"+
		"And daily new exactions are devised,\n"+
		"As blanks, benevolences, and I wot not what:\n"+
		"But what, o' God's name, doth become of this?\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"Wars have not wasted it, for warr'd he hath not,\n"+
		"But basely yielded upon compromise\n"+
		"That which his noble ancestors achieved with blows:\n"+
		"More hath he spent in peace than they in wars.\n"+
		"LORD ROSS\n"+
		"The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm.\n"+
		"LORD WILLOUGHBY\n"+
		"The king's grown bankrupt, like a broken man.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him.\n"+
		"LORD ROSS\n"+
		"He hath not money for these Irish wars,\n"+
		"His burthenous taxations notwithstanding,\n"+
		"But by the robbing of the banish'd duke.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"His noble kinsman: most degenerate king!\n"+
		"But, lords, we hear this fearful tempest sing,\n"+
		"Yet see no shelter to avoid the storm;\n"+
		"We see the wind sit sore upon our sails,\n"+
		"And yet we strike not, but securely perish.\n"+
		"LORD ROSS\n"+
		"We see the very wreck that we must suffer;\n"+
		"And unavoided is the danger now,\n"+
		"For suffering so the causes of our wreck.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"Not so; even through the hollow eyes of death\n"+
		"I spy life peering; but I dare not say\n"+
		"How near the tidings of our comfort is.\n"+
		"LORD WILLOUGHBY\n"+
		"Nay, let us share thy thoughts, as thou dost ours.\n"+
		"LORD ROSS\n"+
		"Be confident to speak, Northumberland:\n"+
		"We three are but thyself; and, speaking so,\n"+
		"Thy words are but as thoughts; therefore, be bold.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"Then thus: I have from Port le Blanc, a bay\n"+
		"In Brittany, received intelligence\n"+
		"That Harry Duke of Hereford, Rainold Lord Cobham,\n"+
		"That late broke from the Duke of Exeter,\n"+
		"His brother, Archbishop late of Canterbury,\n"+
		"Sir Thomas Erpingham, Sir John Ramston,\n"+
		"Sir John Norbery, Sir Robert Waterton and Francis Quoint,\n"+
		"All these well furnish'd by the Duke of Bretagne\n"+
		"With eight tall ships, three thousand men of war,\n"+
		"Are making hither with all due expedience\n"+
		"And shortly mean to touch our northern shore:\n"+
		"Perhaps they had ere this, but that they stay\n"+
		"The first departing of the king for Ireland.\n"+
		"If then we shall shake off our slavish yoke,\n"+
		"Imp out our drooping country's broken wing,\n"+
		"Redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown,\n"+
		"Wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre's gilt\n"+
		"And make high majesty look like itself,\n"+
		"Away with me in post to Ravenspurgh;\n"+
		"But if you faint, as fearing to do so,\n"+
		"Stay and be secret, and myself will go.\n"+
		"LORD ROSS\n"+
		"To horse, to horse! urge doubts to them that fear.\n"+
		"LORD WILLOUGHBY\n"+
		"Hold out my horse, and I will first be there.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. The palace.\n"+
		"Enter QUEEN, BUSHY, and BAGOT\n"+
		"BUSHY\n"+
		"Madam, your majesty is too much sad:\n"+
		"You promised, when you parted with the king,\n"+
		"To lay aside life-harming heaviness\n"+
		"And entertain a cheerful disposition.\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"To please the king I did; to please myself\n"+
		"I cannot do it; yet I know no cause\n"+
		"Why I should welcome such a guest as grief,\n"+
		"Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest\n"+
		"As my sweet Richard: yet again, methinks,\n"+
		"Some unborn sorrow, ripe in fortune's womb,\n"+
		"Is coming towards me, and my inward soul\n"+
		"With nothing trembles: at some thing it grieves,\n"+
		"More than with parting from my lord the king.\n"+
		"BUSHY\n"+
		"Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows,\n"+
		"Which shows like grief itself, but is not so;\n"+
		"For sorrow's eye, glazed with blinding tears,\n"+
		"Divides one thing entire to many objects;\n"+
		"Like perspectives, which rightly gazed upon\n"+
		"Show nothing but confusion, eyed awry\n"+
		"Distinguish form: so your sweet majesty,\n"+
		"Looking awry upon your lord's departure,\n"+
		"Find shapes of grief, more than himself, to wail;\n"+
		"Which, look'd on as it is, is nought but shadows\n"+
		"Of what it is not. Then, thrice-gracious queen,\n"+
		"More than your lord's departure weep not: more's not seen;\n"+
		"Or if it be, 'tis with false sorrow's eye,\n"+
		"Which for things true weeps things imaginary.\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"It may be so; but yet my inward soul\n"+
		"Persuades me it is otherwise: howe'er it be,\n"+
		"I cannot but be sad; so heavy sad\n"+
		"As, though on thinking on no thought I think,\n"+
		"Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink.\n"+
		"BUSHY\n"+
		"'Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady.\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"'Tis nothing less: conceit is still derived\n"+
		"From some forefather grief; mine is not so,\n"+
		"For nothing had begot my something grief;\n"+
		"Or something hath the nothing that I grieve:\n"+
		"'Tis in reversion that I do possess;\n"+
		"But what it is, that is not yet known; what\n"+
		"I cannot name; 'tis nameless woe, I wot.\n"+
		"Enter GREEN\n"+
		"GREEN\n"+
		"God save your majesty! and well met, gentlemen:\n"+
		"I hope the king is not yet shipp'd for Ireland.\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"Why hopest thou so? 'tis better hope he is;\n"+
		"For his designs crave haste, his haste good hope:\n"+
		"Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipp'd?\n"+
		"GREEN\n"+
		"That he, our hope, might have retired his power,\n"+
		"And driven into despair an enemy's hope,\n"+
		"Who strongly hath set footing in this land:\n"+
		"The banish'd Bolingbroke repeals himself,\n"+
		"And with uplifted arms is safe arrived\n"+
		"At Ravenspurgh.\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"Now God in heaven forbid!\n"+
		"GREEN\n"+
		"Ah, madam, 'tis too true: and that is worse,\n"+
		"The Lord Northumberland, his son young Henry Percy,\n"+
		"The Lords of Ross, Beaumond, and Willoughby,\n"+
		"With all their powerful friends, are fled to him.\n"+
		"BUSHY\n"+
		"Why have you not proclaim'd Northumberland\n"+
		"And all the rest revolted faction traitors?\n"+
		"GREEN\n"+
		"We have: whereupon the Earl of Worcester\n"+
		"Hath broke his staff, resign'd his stewardship,\n"+
		"And all the household servants fled with him\n"+
		"To Bolingbroke.\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"So, Green, thou art the midwife to my woe,\n"+
		"And Bolingbroke my sorrow's dismal heir:\n"+
		"Now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy,\n"+
		"And I, a gasping new-deliver'd mother,\n"+
		"Have woe to woe, sorrow to sorrow join'd.\n"+
		"BUSHY\n"+
		"Despair not, madam.\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"Who shall hinder me?\n"+
		"I will despair, and be at enmity\n"+
		"With cozening hope: he is a flatterer,\n"+
		"A parasite, a keeper back of death,\n"+
		"Who gently would dissolve the bands of life,\n"+
		"Which false hope lingers in extremity.\n"+
		"Enter DUKE OF YORK\n"+
		"GREEN\n"+
		"Here comes the Duke of York.\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"With signs of war about his aged neck:\n"+
		"O, full of careful business are his looks!\n"+
		"Uncle, for God's sake, speak comfortable words.\n"+
		"DUKE OF YORK\n"+
		"Should I do so, I should belie my thoughts:\n"+
		"Comfort's in heaven; and we are on the earth,\n"+
		"Where nothing lives but crosses, cares and grief.\n"+
		"Your husband, he is gone to save far off,\n"+
		"Whilst others come to make him lose at home:\n"+
		"Here am I left to underprop his land,\n"+
		"Who, weak with age, cannot support myself:\n"+
		"Now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made;\n"+
		"Now shall he try his friends that flatter'd him.\n"+
		"Enter a Servant\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"My lord, your son was gone before I came.\n"+
		"DUKE OF YORK\n"+
		"He was? Why, so! go all which way it will!\n"+
		"The nobles they are fled, the commons they are cold,\n"+
		"And will, I fear, revolt on Hereford's side.\n"+
		"Sirrah, get thee to Plashy, to my sister Gloucester;\n"+
		"Bid her send me presently a thousand pound:\n"+
		"Hold, take my ring.\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"My lord, I had forgot to tell your lordship,\n"+
		"To-day, as I came by, I called there;\n"+
		"But I shall grieve you to report the rest.\n"+
		"DUKE OF YORK\n"+
		"What is't, knave?\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"An hour before I came, the duchess died.\n"+
		"DUKE OF YORK\n"+
		"God for his mercy! what a tide of woes\n"+
		"Comes rushing on this woeful land at once!\n"+
		"I know not what to do: I would to God,\n"+
		"So my untruth had not provoked him to it,\n"+
		"The king had cut off my head with my brother's.\n"+
		"What, are there no posts dispatch'd for Ireland?\n"+
		"How shall we do for money for these wars?\n"+
		"Come, sister,--cousin, I would say--pray, pardon me.\n"+
		"Go, fellow, get thee home, provide some carts\n"+
		"And bring away the armour that is there.\n"+
		"Exit Servant\n"+
		"Gentlemen, will you go muster men?\n"+
		"If I know how or which way to order these affairs\n"+
		"Thus thrust disorderly into my hands,\n"+
		"Never believe me. Both are my kinsmen:\n"+
		"The one is my sovereign, whom both my oath\n"+
		"And duty bids defend; the other again\n"+
		"Is my kinsman, whom the king hath wrong'd,\n"+
		"Whom conscience and my kindred bids to right.\n"+
		"Well, somewhat we must do. Come, cousin, I'll\n"+
		"Dispose of you.\n"+
		"Gentlemen, go, muster up your men,\n"+
		"And meet me presently at Berkeley.\n"+
		"I should to Plashy too;\n"+
		"But time will not permit: all is uneven,\n"+
		"And every thing is left at six and seven.\n"+
		"Exeunt DUKE OF YORK and QUEEN\n"+
		"BUSHY\n"+
		"The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland,\n"+
		"But none returns. For us to levy power\n"+
		"Proportionable to the enemy\n"+
		"Is all unpossible.\n"+
		"GREEN\n"+
		"Besides, our nearness to the king in love\n"+
		"Is near the hate of those love not the king.\n"+
		"BAGOT\n"+
		"And that's the wavering commons: for their love\n"+
		"Lies in their purses, and whoso empties them\n"+
		"By so much fills their hearts with deadly hate.\n"+
		"BUSHY\n"+
		"Wherein the king stands generally condemn'd.\n"+
		"BAGOT\n"+
		"If judgement lie in them, then so do we,\n"+
		"Because we ever have been near the king.\n"+
		"GREEN\n"+
		"Well, I will for refuge straight to Bristol castle:\n"+
		"The Earl of Wiltshire is already there.\n"+
		"BUSHY\n"+
		"Thither will I with you; for little office\n"+
		"The hateful commons will perform for us,\n"+
		"Except like curs to tear us all to pieces.\n"+
		"Will you go along with us?\n"+
		"BAGOT\n"+
		"No; I will to Ireland to his majesty.\n"+
		"Farewell: if heart's presages be not vain,\n"+
		"We three here art that ne'er shall meet again.\n"+
		"BUSHY\n"+
		"That's as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke.\n"+
		"GREEN\n"+
		"Alas, poor duke! the task he undertakes\n"+
		"Is numbering sands and drinking oceans dry:\n"+
		"Where one on his side fights, thousands will fly.\n"+
		"Farewell at once, for once, for all, and ever.\n"+
		"BUSHY\n"+
		"Well, we may meet again.\n"+
		"BAGOT\n"+
		"I fear me, never.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. Wilds in Gloucestershire.\n"+
		"Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE and NORTHUMBERLAND, with Forces\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"How far is it, my lord, to Berkeley now?\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"Believe me, noble lord,\n"+
		"I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire:\n"+
		"These high wild hills and rough uneven ways\n"+
		"Draws out our miles, and makes them wearisome,\n"+
		"And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar,\n"+
		"Making the hard way sweet and delectable.\n"+
		"But I bethink me what a weary way\n"+
		"From Ravenspurgh to Cotswold will be found\n"+
		"In Ross and Willoughby, wanting your company,\n"+
		"Which, I protest, hath very much beguiled\n"+
		"The tediousness and process of my travel:\n"+
		"But theirs is sweetened with the hope to have\n"+
		"The present benefit which I possess;\n"+
		"And hope to joy is little less in joy\n"+
		"Than hope enjoy'd: by this the weary lords\n"+
		"Shall make their way seem short, as mine hath done\n"+
		"By sight of what I have, your noble company.\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"Of much less value is my company\n"+
		"Than your good words. But who comes here?\n"+
		"Enter HENRY PERCY\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"It is my son, young Harry Percy,\n"+
		"Sent from my brother Worcester, whencesoever.\n"+
		"Harry, how fares your uncle?\n"+
		"HENRY PERCY\n"+
		"I had thought, my lord, to have learn'd his health of you.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"Why, is he not with the queen?\n"+
		"HENRY PERCY\n"+
		"No, my good Lord; he hath forsook the court,\n"+
		"Broken his staff of office and dispersed\n"+
		"The household of the king.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"What was his reason?\n"+
		"He was not so resolved when last we spake together.\n"+
		"HENRY PERCY\n"+
		"Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor.\n"+
		"But he, my lord, is gone to Ravenspurgh,\n"+
		"To offer service to the Duke of Hereford,\n"+
		"And sent me over by Berkeley, to discover\n"+
		"What power the Duke of York had levied there;\n"+
		"Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy?\n"+
		"HENRY PERCY\n"+
		"No, my good lord, for that is not forgot\n"+
		"Which ne'er I did remember: to my knowledge,\n"+
		"I never in my life did look on him.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"Then learn to know him now; this is the duke.\n"+
		"HENRY PERCY\n"+
		"My gracious lord, I tender you my service,\n"+
		"Such as it is, being tender, raw and young:\n"+
		"Which elder days shall ripen and confirm\n"+
		"To more approved service and desert.\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"I thank thee, gentle Percy; and be sure\n"+
		"I count myself in nothing else so happy\n"+
		"As in a soul remembering my good friends;\n"+
		"And, as my fortune ripens with thy love,\n"+
		"It shall be still thy true love's recompense:\n"+
		"My heart this covenant makes, my hand thus seals it.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"How far is it to Berkeley? and what stir\n"+
		"Keeps good old York there with his men of war?\n"+
		"HENRY PERCY\n"+
		"There stands the castle, by yon tuft of trees,\n"+
		"Mann'd with three hundred men, as I have heard;\n"+
		"And in it are the Lords of York, Berkeley, and Seymour;\n"+
		"None else of name and noble estimate.\n"+
		"Enter LORD ROSS and LORD WILLOUGHBY\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby,\n"+
		"Bloody with spurring, fiery-red with haste.\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"Welcome, my lords. I wot your love pursues\n"+
		"A banish'd traitor: all my treasury\n"+
		"Is yet but unfelt thanks, which more enrich'd\n"+
		"Shall be your love and labour's recompense.\n"+
		"LORD ROSS\n"+
		"Your presence makes us rich, most noble lord.\n"+
		"LORD WILLOUGHBY\n"+
		"And far surmounts our labour to attain it.\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"Evermore thanks, the exchequer of the poor;\n"+
		"Which, till my infant fortune comes to years,\n"+
		"Stands for my bounty. But who comes here?\n"+
		"Enter LORD BERKELEY\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"It is my Lord of Berkeley, as I guess.\n"+
		"LORD BERKELEY\n"+
		"My Lord of Hereford, my message is to you.\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"My lord, my answer is--to Lancaster;\n"+
		"And I am come to seek that name in England;\n"+
		"And I must find that title in your tongue,\n"+
		"Before I make reply to aught you say.\n"+
		"LORD BERKELEY\n"+
		"Mistake me not, my lord; 'tis not my meaning\n"+
		"To raze one title of your honour out:\n"+
		"To you, my lord, I come, what lord you will,\n"+
		"From the most gracious regent of this land,\n"+
		"The Duke of York, to know what pricks you on\n"+
		"To take advantage of the absent time\n"+
		"And fright our native peace with self-born arms.\n"+
		"Enter DUKE OF YORK attended\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"I shall not need transport my words by you;\n"+
		"Here comes his grace in person. My noble uncle!\n"+
		"Kneels\n"+
		"DUKE OF YORK\n"+
		"Show me thy humble heart, and not thy knee,\n"+
		"Whose duty is deceiveable and false.\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"My gracious uncle--\n"+
		"DUKE OF YORK\n"+
		"Tut, tut!\n"+
		"Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle:\n"+
		"I am no traitor's uncle; and that word 'grace.'\n"+
		"In an ungracious mouth is but profane.\n"+
		"Why have those banish'd and forbidden legs\n"+
		"Dared once to touch a dust of England's ground?\n"+
		"But then more 'why?' why have they dared to march\n"+
		"So many miles upon her peaceful bosom,\n"+
		"Frighting her pale-faced villages with war\n"+
		"And ostentation of despised arms?\n"+
		"Comest thou because the anointed king is hence?\n"+
		"Why, foolish boy, the king is left behind,\n"+
		"And in my loyal bosom lies his power.\n"+
		"Were I but now the lord of such hot youth\n"+
		"As when brave Gaunt, thy father, and myself\n"+
		"Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,\n"+
		"From forth the ranks of many thousand French,\n"+
		"O, then how quickly should this arm of mine.\n"+
		"Now prisoner to the palsy, chastise thee\n"+
		"And minister correction to thy fault!\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"My gracious uncle, let me know my fault:\n"+
		"On what condition stands it and wherein?\n"+
		"DUKE OF YORK\n"+
		"Even in condition of the worst degree,\n"+
		"In gross rebellion and detested treason:\n"+
		"Thou art a banish'd man, and here art come\n"+
		"Before the expiration of thy time,\n"+
		"In braving arms against thy sovereign.\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"As I was banish'd, I was banish'd Hereford;\n"+
		"But as I come, I come for Lancaster.\n"+
		"And, noble uncle, I beseech your grace\n"+
		"Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye:\n"+
		"You are my father, for methinks in you\n"+
		"I see old Gaunt alive; O, then, my father,\n"+
		"Will you permit that I shall stand condemn'd\n"+
		"A wandering vagabond; my rights and royalties\n"+
		"Pluck'd from my arms perforce and given away\n"+
		"To upstart unthrifts? Wherefore was I born?\n"+
		"If that my cousin king be King of England,\n"+
		"It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster.\n"+
		"You have a son, Aumerle, my noble cousin;\n"+
		"Had you first died, and he been thus trod down,\n"+
		"He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father,\n"+
		"To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay.\n"+
		"I am denied to sue my livery here,\n"+
		"And yet my letters-patents give me leave:\n"+
		"My father's goods are all distrain'd and sold,\n"+
		"And these and all are all amiss employ'd.\n"+
		"What would you have me do? I am a subject,\n"+
		"And I challenge law: attorneys are denied me;\n"+
		"And therefore, personally I lay my claim\n"+
		"To my inheritance of free descent.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"The noble duke hath been too much abused.\n"+
		"LORD ROSS\n"+
		"It stands your grace upon to do him right.\n"+
		"LORD WILLOUGHBY\n"+
		"Base men by his endowments are made great.\n"+
		"DUKE OF YORK\n"+
		"My lords of England, let me tell you this:\n"+
		"I have had feeling of my cousin's wrongs\n"+
		"And laboured all I could to do him right;\n"+
		"But in this kind to come, in braving arms,\n"+
		"Be his own carver and cut out his way,\n"+
		"To find out right with wrong, it may not be;\n"+
		"And you that do abet him in this kind\n"+
		"Cherish rebellion and are rebels all.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"The noble duke hath sworn his coming is\n"+
		"But for his own; and for the right of that\n"+
		"We all have strongly sworn to give him aid;\n"+
		"And let him ne'er see joy that breaks that oath!\n"+
		"DUKE OF YORK\n"+
		"Well, well, I see the issue of these arms:\n"+
		"I cannot mend it, I must needs confess,\n"+
		"Because my power is weak and all ill left:\n"+
		"But if I could, by Him that gave me life,\n"+
		"I would attach you all and make you stoop\n"+
		"Unto the sovereign mercy of the king;\n"+
		"But since I cannot, be it known to you\n"+
		"I do remain as neuter. So, fare you well;\n"+
		"Unless you please to enter in the castle\n"+
		"And there repose you for this night.\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"An offer, uncle, that we will accept:\n"+
		"But we must win your grace to go with us\n"+
		"To Bristol castle, which they say is held\n"+
		"By Bushy, Bagot and their complices,\n"+
		"The caterpillars of the commonwealth,\n"+
		"Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away.\n"+
		"DUKE OF YORK\n"+
		"It may be I will go with you: but yet I'll pause;\n"+
		"For I am loath to break our country's laws.\n"+
		"Nor friends nor foes, to me welcome you are:\n"+
		"Things past redress are now with me past care.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV. A camp in Wales.\n"+
		"Enter EARL OF SALISBURY and a Welsh Captain\n"+
		"Captain\n"+
		"My lord of Salisbury, we have stay'd ten days,\n"+
		"And hardly kept our countrymen together,\n"+
		"And yet we hear no tidings from the king;\n"+
		"Therefore we will disperse ourselves: farewell.\n"+
		"EARL OF SALISBURY\n"+
		"Stay yet another day, thou trusty Welshman:\n"+
		"The king reposeth all his confidence in thee.\n"+
		"Captain\n"+
		"'Tis thought the king is dead; we will not stay.\n"+
		"The bay-trees in our country are all wither'd\n"+
		"And meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven;\n"+
		"The pale-faced moon looks bloody on the earth\n"+
		"And lean-look'd prophets whisper fearful change;\n"+
		"Rich men look sad and ruffians dance and leap,\n"+
		"The one in fear to lose what they enjoy,\n"+

		"EARL OF SALISBURY\n"+
		"Ah, Richard, with the eyes of heavy mind\n"+
		"I see thy glory like a shooting star\n"+
		"Fall to the base earth from the firmament.\n"+
		"Thy sun sets weeping in the lowly west,\n"+
		"Witnessing storms to come, woe and unrest:\n"+
		"Thy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes,\n"+

		"Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE, DUKE OF YORK, NORTHUMBERLAND, LORD ROSS, HENRY PERCY, LORD WILLOUGHBY, with BUSHY and GREEN, prisoners\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"Bring forth these men.\n"+
		"Bushy and Green, I will not vex your souls--\n"+
		"Since presently your souls must part your bodies--\n"+
		"With too much urging your pernicious lives,\n"+
		"For 'twere no charity; yet, to wash your blood\n"+
		"From off my hands, here in the view of men\n"+
		"I will unfold some causes of your deaths.\n"+
		"You have misled a prince, a royal king,\n"+
		"A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments,\n"+
		"By you unhappied and disfigured clean:\n"+
		"You have in manner with your sinful hours\n"+
		"Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him,\n"+
		"Broke the possession of a royal bed\n"+
		"And stain'd the beauty of a fair queen's cheeks\n"+
		"With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs.\n"+
		"Myself, a prince by fortune of my birth,\n"+
		"Near to the king in blood, and near in love\n"+
		"Till you did make him misinterpret me,\n"+
		"Have stoop'd my neck under your injuries,\n"+
		"And sigh'd my English breath in foreign clouds,\n"+
		"Eating the bitter bread of banishment;\n"+
		"Whilst you have fed upon my signories,\n"+
		"Dispark'd my parks and fell'd my forest woods,\n"+
		"From my own windows torn my household coat,\n"+
		"Razed out my imprese, leaving me no sign,\n"+
		"Save men's opinions and my living blood,\n"+
		"To show the world I am a gentleman.\n"+
		"This and much more, much more than twice all this,\n"+
		"Condemns you to the death. See them deliver'd over\n"+
		"To execution and the hand of death.\n"+
		"BUSHY\n"+
		"More welcome is the stroke of death to me\n"+
		"Than Bolingbroke to England. Lords, farewell.\n"+
		"GREEN\n"+
		"My comfort is that heaven will take our souls\n"+

		"SCENE II. The coast of Wales. A castle in view.\n"+

		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Barkloughly castle call they this at hand?\n"+
		"DUKE OF AUMERLE\n"+
		"Yea, my lord. How brooks your grace the air,\n"+
		"After your late tossing on the breaking seas?\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Needs must I like it well: I weep for joy\n"+
		"To stand upon my kingdom once again.\n"+
		"Dear earth, I do salute thee with my hand,\n"+
		"Though rebels wound thee with their horses' hoofs:\n"+
		"As a long-parted mother with her child\n"+
		"Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting,\n"+
		"So, weeping, smiling, greet I thee, my earth,\n"+
		"And do thee favours with my royal hands.\n"+
		"Feed not thy sovereign's foe, my gentle earth,\n"+
		"Nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense;\n"+
		"But let thy spiders, that suck up thy venom,\n"+
		"And heavy-gaited toads lie in their way,\n"+
		"Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet\n"+
		"Which with usurping steps do trample thee:\n"+
		"Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies;\n"+
		"And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower,\n"+
		"Guard it, I pray thee, with a lurking adder\n"+
		"Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch\n"+
		"Throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies.\n"+
		"Mock not my senseless conjuration, lords:\n"+
		"This earth shall have a feeling and these stones\n"+
		"Prove armed soldiers, ere her native king\n"+
		"Shall falter under foul rebellion's arms.\n"+
		"BISHOP OF CARLISLE\n"+
		"Fear not, my lord: that Power that made you king\n"+
		"Hath power to keep you king in spite of all.\n"+
		"The means that heaven yields must be embraced,\n"+
		"And not neglected; else, if heaven would,\n"+
		"And we will not, heaven's offer we refuse,\n"+
		"The proffer'd means of succor and redress.\n"+
		"DUKE OF AUMERLE\n"+
		"He means, my lord, that we are too remiss;\n"+
		"Whilst Bolingbroke, through our security,\n"+
		"Grows strong and great in substance and in power.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Discomfortable cousin! know'st thou not\n"+
		"That when the searching eye of heaven is hid,\n"+
		"Behind the globe, that lights the lower world,\n"+
		"Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen\n"+
		"In murders and in outrage, boldly here;\n"+
		"But when from under this terrestrial ball\n"+
		"He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines\n"+
		"And darts his light through every guilty hole,\n"+
		"Then murders, treasons and detested sins,\n"+
		"The cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs,\n"+
		"Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves?\n"+
		"So when this thief, this traitor, Bolingbroke,\n"+
		"Who all this while hath revell'd in the night\n"+
		"Whilst we were wandering with the antipodes,\n"+
		"Shall see us rising in our throne, the east,\n"+
		"His treasons will sit blushing in his face,\n"+
		"Not able to endure the sight of day,\n"+
		"But self-affrighted tremble at his sin.\n"+
		"Not all the water in the rough rude sea\n"+
		"Can wash the balm off from an anointed king;\n"+
		"The breath of worldly men cannot depose\n"+
		"The deputy elected by the Lord:\n"+
		"For every man that Bolingbroke hath press'd\n"+
		"To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown,\n"+
		"God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay\n"+
		"A glorious angel: then, if angels fight,\n"+
		"Weak men must fall, for heaven still guards the right.\n"+
		"Enter EARL OF SALISBURY\n"+
		"Welcome, my lord how far off lies your power?\n"+
		"EARL OF SALISBURY\n"+
		"Nor near nor farther off, my gracious lord,\n"+
		"Than this weak arm: discomfort guides my tongue\n"+
		"And bids me speak of nothing but despair.\n"+
		"One day too late, I fear me, noble lord,\n"+
		"Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth:\n"+
		"O, call back yesterday, bid time return,\n"+
		"And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men!\n"+
		"To-day, to-day, unhappy day, too late,\n"+
		"O'erthrows thy joys, friends, fortune and thy state:\n"+
		"For all the Welshmen, hearing thou wert dead.\n"+
		"Are gone to Bolingbroke, dispersed and fled.\n"+
		"DUKE OF AUMERLE\n"+
		"Comfort, my liege; why looks your grace so pale?\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"But now the blood of twenty thousand men\n"+
		"Did triumph in my face, and they are fled;\n"+
		"And, till so much blood thither come again,\n"+
		"Have I not reason to look pale and dead?\n"+
		"All souls that will be safe fly from my side,\n"+
		"For time hath set a blot upon my pride.\n"+
		"DUKE OF AUMERLE\n"+
		"Comfort, my liege; remember who you are.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"I had forgot myself; am I not king?\n"+
		"Awake, thou coward majesty! thou sleepest.\n"+
		"Is not the king's name twenty thousand names?\n"+
		"Arm, arm, my name! a puny subject strikes\n"+
		"At thy great glory. Look not to the ground,\n"+
		"Ye favourites of a king: are we not high?\n"+
		"High be our thoughts: I know my uncle York\n"+
		"Hath power enough to serve our turn. But who comes here?\n"+
		"Enter SIR STEPHEN SCROOP\n"+
		"SIR STEPHEN SCROOP\n"+
		"More health and happiness betide my liege\n"+
		"Than can my care-tuned tongue deliver him!\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Mine ear is open and my heart prepared;\n"+
		"The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold.\n"+
		"Say, is my kingdom lost? why, 'twas my care\n"+
		"And what loss is it to be rid of care?\n"+
		"Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we?\n"+
		"Greater he shall not be; if he serve God,\n"+
		"We'll serve Him too and be his fellow so:\n"+
		"Revolt our subjects? that we cannot mend;\n"+
		"They break their faith to God as well as us:\n"+
		"Cry woe, destruction, ruin and decay:\n"+
		"The worst is death, and death will have his day.\n"+
		"SIR STEPHEN SCROOP\n"+
		"Glad am I that your highness is so arm'd\n"+
		"To bear the tidings of calamity.\n"+
		"Like an unseasonable stormy day,\n"+
		"Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores,\n"+
		"As if the world were all dissolved to tears,\n"+
		"So high above his limits swells the rage\n"+
		"Of Bolingbroke, covering your fearful land\n"+
		"With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel.\n"+
		"White-beards have arm'd their thin and hairless scalps\n"+
		"Against thy majesty; boys, with women's voices,\n"+
		"Strive to speak big and clap their female joints\n"+
		"In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown:\n"+
		"The very beadsmen learn to bend their bows\n"+
		"Of double-fatal yew against thy state;\n"+
		"Yea, distaff-women manage rusty bills\n"+
		"Against thy seat: both young and old rebel,\n"+
		"And all goes worse than I have power to tell.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Too well, too well thou tell'st a tale so ill.\n"+
		"Where is the Earl of Wiltshire? where is Bagot?\n"+
		"What is become of Bushy? where is Green?\n"+
		"That they have let the dangerous enemy\n"+
		"Measure our confines with such peaceful steps?\n"+
		"If we prevail, their heads shall pay for it:\n"+
		"I warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke.\n"+
		"SIR STEPHEN SCROOP\n"+
		"Peace have they made with him indeed, my lord.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"O villains, vipers, damn'd without redemption!\n"+
		"Dogs, easily won to fawn on any man!\n"+
		"Snakes, in my heart-blood warm'd, that sting my heart!\n"+
		"Three Judases, each one thrice worse than Judas!\n"+
		"Would they make peace? terrible hell make war\n"+
		"Upon their spotted souls for this offence!\n"+
		"SIR STEPHEN SCROOP\n"+
		"Sweet love, I see, changing his property,\n"+
		"Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate:\n"+
		"Again uncurse their souls; their peace is made\n"+
		"With heads, and not with hands; those whom you curse\n"+
		"Have felt the worst of death's destroying wound\n"+
		"And lie full low, graved in the hollow ground.\n"+
		"DUKE OF AUMERLE\n"+
		"Is Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire dead?\n"+
		"SIR STEPHEN SCROOP\n"+
		"Ay, all of them at Bristol lost their heads.\n"+
		"DUKE OF AUMERLE\n"+
		"Where is the duke my father with his power?\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"No matter where; of comfort no man speak:\n"+
		"Let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs;\n"+
		"Make dust our paper and with rainy eyes\n"+
		"Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth,\n"+
		"Let's choose executors and talk of wills:\n"+
		"And yet not so, for what can we bequeath\n"+
		"Save our deposed bodies to the ground?\n"+
		"Our lands, our lives and all are Bolingbroke's,\n"+
		"And nothing can we call our own but death\n"+
		"And that small model of the barren earth\n"+
		"Which serves as paste and cover to our bones.\n"+
		"For God's sake, let us sit upon the ground\n"+
		"And tell sad stories of the death of kings;\n"+
		"How some have been deposed; some slain in war,\n"+
		"Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed;\n"+
		"Some poison'd by their wives: some sleeping kill'd;\n"+
		"All murder'd: for within the hollow crown\n"+
		"That rounds the mortal temples of a king\n"+
		"Keeps Death his court and there the antic sits,\n"+
		"Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp,\n"+
		"Allowing him a breath, a little scene,\n"+
		"To monarchize, be fear'd and kill with looks,\n"+
		"Infusing him with self and vain conceit,\n"+
		"As if this flesh which walls about our life,\n"+
		"Were brass impregnable, and humour'd thus\n"+
		"Comes at the last and with a little pin\n"+
		"Bores through his castle wall, and farewell king!\n"+
		"Cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood\n"+
		"With solemn reverence: throw away respect,\n"+
		"Tradition, form and ceremonious duty,\n"+
		"For you have but mistook me all this while:\n"+
		"I live with bread like you, feel want,\n"+
		"Taste grief, need friends: subjected thus,\n"+
		"How can you say to me, I am a king?\n"+
		"BISHOP OF CARLISLE\n"+
		"My lord, wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes,\n"+
		"But presently prevent the ways to wail.\n"+
		"To fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength,\n"+
		"Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe,\n"+
		"And so your follies fight against yourself.\n"+
		"Fear and be slain; no worse can come to fight:\n"+
		"And fight and die is death destroying death;\n"+
		"Where fearing dying pays death servile breath.\n"+
		"DUKE OF AUMERLE\n"+
		"My father hath a power; inquire of him\n"+
		"And learn to make a body of a limb.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Thou chidest me well: proud Bolingbroke, I come\n"+
		"To change blows with thee for our day of doom.\n"+
		"This ague fit of fear is over-blown;\n"+
		"An easy task it is to win our own.\n"+
		"Say, Scroop, where lies our uncle with his power?\n"+
		"Speak sweetly, man, although thy looks be sour.\n"+
		"SIR STEPHEN SCROOP\n"+
		"Men judge by the complexion of the sky\n"+
		"The state and inclination of the day:\n"+
		"So may you by my dull and heavy eye,\n"+
		"My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say.\n"+
		"I play the torturer, by small and small\n"+
		"To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken:\n"+
		"Your uncle York is join'd with Bolingbroke,\n"+
		"And all your northern castles yielded up,\n"+
		"And all your southern gentlemen in arms\n"+
		"Upon his party.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Thou hast said enough.\n"+
		"Beshrew thee, cousin, which didst lead me forth\n"+
		"To DUKE OF AUMERLE\n"+
		"Of that sweet way I was in to despair!\n"+
		"What say you now? what comfort have we now?\n"+
		"By heaven, I'll hate him everlastingly\n"+
		"That bids me be of comfort any more.\n"+
		"Go to Flint castle: there I'll pine away;\n"+
		"A king, woe's slave, shall kingly woe obey.\n"+
		"That power I have, discharge; and let them go\n"+
		"To ear the land that hath some hope to grow,\n"+
		"For I have none: let no man speak again\n"+
		"To alter this, for counsel is but vain.\n"+
		"DUKE OF AUMERLE\n"+
		"My liege, one word.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"He does me double wrong\n"+
		"That wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue.\n"+
		"Discharge my followers: let them hence away,\n"+
		"From Richard's night to Bolingbroke's fair day.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. Wales. Before Flint castle.\n"+
		"Enter, with drum and colours, HENRY BOLINGBROKE, DUKE OF YORK, NORTHUMBERLAND, Attendants, and forces\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"So that by this intelligence we learn\n"+
		"The Welshmen are dispersed, and Salisbury\n"+
		"Is gone to meet the king, who lately landed\n"+
		"With some few private friends upon this coast.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"The news is very fair and good, my lord:\n"+
		"Richard not far from hence hath hid his head.\n"+
		"DUKE OF YORK\n"+
		"It would beseem the Lord Northumberland\n"+
		"To say 'King Richard:' alack the heavy day\n"+
		"When such a sacred king should hide his head.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"Your grace mistakes; only to be brief\n"+
		"Left I his title out.\n"+
		"DUKE OF YORK\n"+
		"The time hath been,\n"+
		"Would you have been so brief with him, he would\n"+
		"Have been so brief with you, to shorten you,\n"+
		"For taking so the head, your whole head's length.\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"Mistake not, uncle, further than you should.\n"+
		"DUKE OF YORK\n"+
		"Take not, good cousin, further than you should.\n"+
		"Lest you mistake the heavens are o'er our heads.\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"I know it, uncle, and oppose not myself\n"+
		"Against their will. But who comes here?\n"+
		"Enter HENRY PERCY\n"+
		"Welcome, Harry: what, will not this castle yield?\n"+
		"HENRY PERCY\n"+
		"The castle royally is mann'd, my lord,\n"+
		"Against thy entrance.\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"Royally!\n"+
		"Why, it contains no king?\n"+
		"HENRY PERCY\n"+
		"Yes, my good lord,\n"+
		"It doth contain a king; King Richard lies\n"+
		"Within the limits of yon lime and stone:\n"+
		"And with him are the Lord Aumerle, Lord Salisbury,\n"+
		"Sir Stephen Scroop, besides a clergyman\n"+
		"Of holy reverence; who, I cannot learn.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"O, belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle.\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"Noble lords,\n"+
		"Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle;\n"+
		"Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley\n"+
		"Into his ruin'd ears, and thus deliver:\n"+
		"Henry Bolingbroke\n"+
		"On both his knees doth kiss King Richard's hand\n"+
		"And sends allegiance and true faith of heart\n"+
		"To his most royal person, hither come\n"+
		"Even at his feet to lay my arms and power,\n"+
		"Provided that my banishment repeal'd\n"+
		"And lands restored again be freely granted:\n"+
		"If not, I'll use the advantage of my power\n"+
		"And lay the summer's dust with showers of blood\n"+
		"Rain'd from the wounds of slaughter'd Englishmen:\n"+
		"The which, how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke\n"+
		"It is, such crimson tempest should bedrench\n"+
		"The fresh green lap of fair King Richard's land,\n"+
		"My stooping duty tenderly shall show.\n"+
		"Go, signify as much, while here we march\n"+
		"Upon the grassy carpet of this plain.\n"+
		"Let's march without the noise of threatening drum,\n"+
		"That from this castle's tatter'd battlements\n"+
		"Our fair appointments may be well perused.\n"+
		"Methinks King Richard and myself should meet\n"+
		"With no less terror than the elements\n"+
		"Of fire and water, when their thundering shock\n"+
		"At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven.\n"+
		"Be he the fire, I'll be the yielding water:\n"+
		"The rage be his, whilst on the earth I rain\n"+
		"My waters; on the earth, and not on him.\n"+
		"March on, and mark King Richard how he looks.\n"+
		"Parle without, and answer within. Then a flourish. Enter on the walls, KING RICHARD II, the BISHOP OF CARLISLE, DUKE OF AUMERLE, SIR STEPHEN SCROOP, and EARL OF SALISBURY\n"+
		"See, see, King Richard doth himself appear,\n"+
		"As doth the blushing discontented sun\n"+
		"From out the fiery portal of the east,\n"+
		"When he perceives the envious clouds are bent\n"+
		"To dim his glory and to stain the track\n"+
		"Of his bright passage to the occident.\n"+
		"DUKE OF YORK\n"+
		"Yet looks he like a king: behold, his eye,\n"+
		"As bright as is the eagle's, lightens forth\n"+
		"Controlling majesty: alack, alack, for woe,\n"+
		"That any harm should stain so fair a show!\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"We are amazed; and thus long have we stood\n"+
		"To watch the fearful bending of thy knee,\n"+
		"To NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"Because we thought ourself thy lawful king:\n"+
		"And if we be, how dare thy joints forget\n"+
		"To pay their awful duty to our presence?\n"+
		"If we be not, show us the hand of God\n"+
		"That hath dismissed us from our stewardship;\n"+
		"For well we know, no hand of blood and bone\n"+
		"Can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre,\n"+
		"Unless he do profane, steal, or usurp.\n"+
		"And though you think that all, as you have done,\n"+
		"Have torn their souls by turning them from us,\n"+
		"And we are barren and bereft of friends;\n"+
		"Yet know, my master, God omnipotent,\n"+
		"Is mustering in his clouds on our behalf\n"+
		"Armies of pestilence; and they shall strike\n"+
		"Your children yet unborn and unbegot,\n"+
		"That lift your vassal hands against my head\n"+
		"And threat the glory of my precious crown.\n"+
		"Tell Bolingbroke--for yond methinks he stands--\n"+
		"That every stride he makes upon my land\n"+
		"Is dangerous treason: he is come to open\n"+
		"The purple testament of bleeding war;\n"+
		"But ere the crown he looks for live in peace,\n"+
		"Ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers' sons\n"+
		"Shall ill become the flower of England's face,\n"+
		"Change the complexion of her maid-pale peace\n"+
		"To scarlet indignation and bedew\n"+
		"Her pastures' grass with faithful English blood.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"The king of heaven forbid our lord the king\n"+
		"Should so with civil and uncivil arms\n"+
		"Be rush'd upon! Thy thrice noble cousin\n"+
		"Harry Bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand;\n"+
		"And by the honourable tomb he swears,\n"+
		"That stands upon your royal grandsire's bones,\n"+
		"And by the royalties of both your bloods,\n"+
		"Currents that spring from one most gracious head,\n"+
		"And by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt,\n"+
		"And by the worth and honour of himself,\n"+
		"Comprising all that may be sworn or said,\n"+
		"His coming hither hath no further scope\n"+
		"Than for his lineal royalties and to beg\n"+
		"Enfranchisement immediate on his kn ees:\n"+
		"Which on thy royal party granted once,\n"+
		"His glittering arms he will commend to rust,\n"+
		"His barbed steeds to stables, and his heart\n"+
		"To faithful service of your majesty.\n"+
		"This swears he, as he is a prince, is just;\n"+
		"And, as I am a gentleman, I credit him.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Northumberland, say thus the king returns:\n"+
		"His noble cousin is right welcome hither;\n"+
		"And all the number of his fair demands\n"+
		"Shall be accomplish'd without contradiction:\n"+
		"With all the gracious utterance thou hast\n"+
		"Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends.\n"+
		"We do debase ourselves, cousin, do we not,\n"+
		"To DUKE OF AUMERLE\n"+
		"To look so poorly and to speak so fair?\n"+
		"Shall we call back Northumberland, and send\n"+
		"Defiance to the traitor, and so die?\n"+
		"DUKE OF AUMERLE\n"+
		"No, good my lord; let's fight with gentle words\n"+
		"Till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"O God, O God! that e'er this tongue of mine,\n"+
		"That laid the sentence of dread banishment\n"+
		"On yon proud man, should take it off again\n"+
		"With words of sooth! O that I were as great\n"+
		"As is my grief, or lesser than my name!\n"+
		"Or that I could forget what I have been,\n"+
		"Or not remember what I must be now!\n"+
		"Swell'st thou, proud heart? I'll give thee scope to beat,\n"+
		"Since foes have scope to beat both thee and me.\n"+
		"DUKE OF AUMERLE\n"+
		"Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"What must the king do now? must he submit?\n"+
		"The king shall do it: must he be deposed?\n"+
		"The king shall be contented: must he lose\n"+
		"The name of king? o' God's name, let it go:\n"+
		"I'll give my jewels for a set of beads,\n"+
		"My gorgeous palace for a hermitage,\n"+
		"My gay apparel for an almsman's gown,\n"+
		"My figured goblets for a dish of wood,\n"+
		"My sceptre for a palmer's walking staff,\n"+
		"My subjects for a pair of carved saints\n"+
		"And my large kingdom for a little grave,\n"+
		"A little little grave, an obscure grave;\n"+
		"Or I'll be buried in the king's highway,\n"+
		"Some way of common trade, where subjects' feet\n"+
		"May hourly trample on their sovereign's head;\n"+
		"For on my heart they tread now whilst I live;\n"+
		"And buried once, why not upon my head?\n"+
		"Aumerle, thou weep'st, my tender-hearted cousin!\n"+
		"We'll make foul weather with despised tears;\n"+
		"Our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn,\n"+
		"And make a dearth in this revolting land.\n"+
		"Or shall we play the wantons with our woes,\n"+
		"And make some pretty match with shedding tears?\n"+
		"As thus, to drop them still upon one place,\n"+
		"Till they have fretted us a pair of graves\n"+
		"Within the earth; and, therein laid,--there lies\n"+
		"Two kinsmen digg'd their graves with weeping eyes.\n"+
		"Would not this ill do well? Well, well, I see\n"+
		"I talk but idly, and you laugh at me.\n"+
		"Most mighty prince, my Lord Northumberland,\n"+
		"What says King Bolingbroke? will his majesty\n"+
		"Give Richard leave to live till Richard die?\n"+
		"You make a leg, and Bolingbroke says ay.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"My lord, in the base court he doth attend\n"+
		"To speak with you; may it please you to come down.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Down, down I come; like glistering Phaethon,\n"+
		"Wanting the manage of unruly jades.\n"+
		"In the base court? Base court, where kings grow base,\n"+
		"To come at traitors' calls and do them grace.\n"+
		"In the base court? Come down? Down, court!\n"+
		"down, king!\n"+
		"For night-owls shriek where mounting larks\n"+
		"should sing.\n"+
		"Exeunt from above\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"What says his majesty?\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"Sorrow and grief of heart\n"+
		"Makes him speak fondly, like a frantic man\n"+
		"Yet he is come.\n"+
		"Enter KING RICHARD and his attendants below\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"Stand all apart,\n"+
		"And show fair duty to his majesty.\n"+
		"He kneels down\n"+
		"My gracious lord,--\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Fair cousin, you debase your princely knee\n"+
		"To make the base earth proud with kissing it:\n"+
		"Me rather had my heart might feel your love\n"+
		"Than my unpleased eye see your courtesy.\n"+
		"Up, cousin, up; your heart is up, I know,\n"+
		"Thus high at least, although your knee be low.\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"My gracious lord, I come but for mine own.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Your own is yours, and I am yours, and all.\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"So far be mine, my most redoubted lord,\n"+
		"As my true service shall deserve your love.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Well you deserve: they well deserve to have,\n"+
		"That know the strong'st and surest way to get.\n"+
		"Uncle, give me your hands: nay, dry your eyes;\n"+
		"Tears show their love, but want their remedies.\n"+
		"Cousin, I am too young to be your father,\n"+
		"Though you are old enough to be my heir.\n"+
		"What you will have, I'll give, and willing too;\n"+
		"For do we must what force will have us do.\n"+
		"Set on towards London, cousin, is it so?\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"Yea, my good lord.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Then I must not say no.\n"+
		"Flourish. Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV. LANGLEY. The DUKE OF YORK's garden.\n"+
		"Enter the QUEEN and two Ladies\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"What sport shall we devise here in this garden,\n"+
		"To drive away the heavy thought of care?\n"+
		"Lady\n"+
		"Madam, we'll play at bowls.\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"'Twill make me think the world is full of rubs,\n"+
		"And that my fortune rubs against the bias.\n"+
		"Lady\n"+
		"Madam, we'll dance.\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"My legs can keep no measure in delight,\n"+
		"When my poor heart no measure keeps in grief:\n"+
		"Therefore, no dancing, girl; some other sport.\n"+
		"Lady\n"+
		"Madam, we'll tell tales.\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"Of sorrow or of joy?\n"+
		"Lady\n"+
		"Of either, madam.\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"Of neither, girl:\n"+
		"For of joy, being altogether wanting,\n"+
		"It doth remember me the more of sorrow;\n"+
		"Or if of grief, being altogether had,\n"+
		"It adds more sorrow to my want of joy:\n"+
		"For what I have I need not to repeat;\n"+
		"And what I want it boots not to complain.\n"+
		"Lady\n"+
		"Madam, I'll sing.\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"'Tis well that thou hast cause\n"+
		"But thou shouldst please me better, wouldst thou weep.\n"+
		"Lady\n"+
		"I could weep, madam, would it do you good.\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"And I could sing, would weeping do me good,\n"+
		"And never borrow any tear of thee.\n"+
		"Enter a Gardener, and two Servants\n"+
		"But stay, here come the gardeners:\n"+
		"Let's step into the shadow of these trees.\n"+
		"My wretchedness unto a row of pins,\n"+
		"They'll talk of state; for every one doth so\n"+
		"Against a change; woe is forerun with woe.\n"+
		"QUEEN and Ladies retire\n"+
		"Gardener\n"+
		"Go, bind thou up yon dangling apricocks,\n"+
		"Which, like unruly children, make their sire\n"+
		"Stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight:\n"+
		"Give some supportance to the bending twigs.\n"+
		"Go thou, and like an executioner,\n"+
		"Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays,\n"+
		"That look too lofty in our commonwealth:\n"+
		"All must be even in our government.\n"+
		"You thus employ'd, I will go root away\n"+
		"The noisome weeds, which without profit suck\n"+
		"The soil's fertility from wholesome flowers.\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"Why should we in the compass of a pale\n"+
		"Keep law and form and due proportion,\n"+
		"Showing, as in a model, our firm estate,\n"+
		"When our sea-walled garden, the whole land,\n"+
		"Is full of weeds, her fairest flowers choked up,\n"+
		"Her fruit-trees all upturned, her hedges ruin'd,\n"+
		"Her knots disorder'd and her wholesome herbs\n"+
		"Swarming with caterpillars?\n"+
		"Gardener\n"+
		"Hold thy peace:\n"+
		"He that hath suffer'd this disorder'd spring\n"+
		"Hath now himself met with the fall of leaf:\n"+
		"The weeds which his broad-spreading leaves did shelter,\n"+
		"That seem'd in eating him to hold him up,\n"+
		"Are pluck'd up root and all by Bolingbroke,\n"+
		"I mean the Earl of Wiltshire, Bushy, Green.\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"What, are they dead?\n"+
		"Gardener\n"+
		"They are; and Bolingbroke\n"+
		"Hath seized the wasteful king. O, what pity is it\n"+
		"That he had not so trimm'd and dress'd his land\n"+
		"As we this garden! We at time of year\n"+
		"Do wound the bark, the skin of our fruit-trees,\n"+
		"Lest, being over-proud in sap and blood,\n"+
		"With too much riches it confound itself:\n"+
		"Had he done so to great and growing men,\n"+
		"They might have lived to bear and he to taste\n"+
		"Their fruits of duty: superfluous branches\n"+
		"We lop away, that bearing boughs may live:\n"+
		"Had he done so, himself had borne the crown,\n"+
		"Which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down.\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"What, think you then the king shall be deposed?\n"+
		"Gardener\n"+
		"Depress'd he is already, and deposed\n"+
		"'Tis doubt he will be: letters came last night\n"+
		"To a dear friend of the good Duke of York's,\n"+
		"That tell black tidings.\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"O, I am press'd to death through want of speaking!\n"+
		"Coming forward\n"+
		"Thou, old Adam's likeness, set to dress this garden,\n"+
		"How dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news?\n"+
		"What Eve, what serpent, hath suggested thee\n"+
		"To make a second fall of cursed man?\n"+
		"Why dost thou say King Richard is deposed?\n"+
		"Darest thou, thou little better thing than earth,\n"+
		"Divine his downfall? Say, where, when, and how,\n"+
		"Camest thou by this ill tidings? speak, thou wretch.\n"+
		"Gardener\n"+
		"Pardon me, madam: little joy have I\n"+
		"To breathe this news; yet what I say is true.\n"+
		"King Richard, he is in the mighty hold\n"+
		"Of Bolingbroke: their fortunes both are weigh'd:\n"+
		"In your lord's scale is nothing but himself,\n"+
		"And some few vanities that make him light;\n"+
		"But in the balance of great Bolingbroke,\n"+
		"Besides himself, are all the English peers,\n"+
		"And with that odds he weighs King Richard down.\n"+
		"Post you to London, and you will find it so;\n"+
		"I speak no more than every one doth know.\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"Nimble mischance, that art so light of foot,\n"+
		"Doth not thy embassage belong to me,\n"+
		"And am I last that knows it? O, thou think'st\n"+
		"To serve me last, that I may longest keep\n"+
		"Thy sorrow in my breast. Come, ladies, go,\n"+
		"To meet at London London's king in woe.\n"+
		"What, was I born to this, that my sad look\n"+
		"Should grace the triumph of great Bolingbroke?\n"+
		"Gardener, for telling me these news of woe,\n"+
		"Pray God the plants thou graft'st may never grow.\n"+
		"Exeunt QUEEN and Ladies\n"+
		"GARDENER\n"+
		"Poor queen! so that thy state might be no worse,\n"+
		"I would my skill were subject to thy curse.\n"+
		"Here did she fall a tear; here in this place\n"+
		"I'll set a bank of rue, sour herb of grace:\n"+
		"Rue, even for ruth, here shortly shall be seen,\n"+
		"In the remembrance of a weeping queen.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT IV\n"+
		"SCENE I. Westminster Hall.\n"+
		"Enter, as to the Parliament, HENRY BOLINGBROKE, DUKE OF AUMERLE, NORTHUMBERLAND, HENRY PERCY, LORD FITZWATER, DUKE OF SURREY, the BISHOP OF CARLISLE, the Abbot Of Westminster, and another Lord, Herald, Officers, and BAGOT\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"Call forth Bagot.\n"+
		"Now, Bagot, freely speak thy mind;\n"+
		"What thou dost know of noble Gloucester's death,\n"+
		"Who wrought it with the king, and who perform'd\n"+
		"The bloody office of his timeless end.\n"+
		"BAGOT\n"+
		"Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle.\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"Cousin, stand forth, and look upon that man.\n"+
		"BAGOT\n"+
		"My Lord Aumerle, I know your daring tongue\n"+
		"Scorns to unsay what once it hath deliver'd.\n"+
		"In that dead time when Gloucester's death was plotted,\n"+
		"I heard you say, 'Is not my arm of length,\n"+
		"That reacheth from the restful English court\n"+
		"As far as Calais, to mine uncle's head?'\n"+
		"Amongst much other talk, that very time,\n"+
		"I heard you say that you had rather refuse\n"+
		"The offer of an hundred thousand crowns\n"+
		"Than Bolingbroke's return to England;\n"+
		"Adding withal how blest this land would be\n"+
		"In this your cousin's death.\n"+
		"DUKE OF AUMERLE\n"+
		"Princes and noble lords,\n"+
		"What answer shall I make to this base man?\n"+
		"Shall I so much dishonour my fair stars,\n"+
		"On equal terms to give him chastisement?\n"+
		"Either I must, or have mine honour soil'd\n"+
		"With the attainder of his slanderous lips.\n"+
		"There is my gage, the manual seal of death,\n"+
		"That marks thee out for hell: I say, thou liest,\n"+
		"And will maintain what thou hast said is false\n"+
		"In thy heart-blood, though being all too base\n"+
		"To stain the temper of my knightly sword.\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"Bagot, forbear; thou shalt not take it up.\n"+
		"DUKE OF AUMERLE\n"+
		"Excepting one, I would he were the best\n"+
		"In all this presence that hath moved me so.\n"+
		"LORD FITZWATER\n"+
		"If that thy valour stand on sympathy,\n"+
		"There is my gage, Aumerle, in gage to thine:\n"+
		"By that fair sun which shows me where thou stand'st,\n"+
		"I heard thee say, and vauntingly thou spakest it\n"+
		"That thou wert cause of noble Gloucester's death.\n"+
		"If thou deny'st it twenty times, thou liest;\n"+
		"And I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart,\n"+
		"Where it was forged, with my rapier's point.\n"+
		"DUKE OF AUMERLE\n"+
		"Thou darest not, coward, live to see that day.\n"+
		"LORD FITZWATER\n"+
		"Now by my soul, I would it were this hour.\n"+
		"DUKE OF AUMERLE\n"+
		"Fitzwater, thou art damn'd to hell for this.\n"+
		"HENRY PERCY\n"+
		"Aumerle, thou liest; his honour is as true\n"+
		"In this appeal as thou art all unjust;\n"+
		"And that thou art so, there I throw my gage,\n"+
		"To prove it on thee to the extremest point\n"+
		"Of mortal breathing: seize it, if thou darest.\n"+
		"DUKE OF AUMERLE\n"+
		"An if I do not, may my hands rot off\n"+
		"And never brandish more revengeful steel\n"+
		"Over the glittering helmet of my foe!\n"+
		"Lord\n"+
		"I task the earth to the like, forsworn Aumerle;\n"+
		"And spur thee on with full as many lies\n"+
		"As may be holloa'd in thy treacherous ear\n"+
		"From sun to sun: there is my honour's pawn;\n"+
		"Engage it to the trial, if thou darest.\n"+
		"DUKE OF AUMERLE\n"+
		"Who sets me else? by heaven, I'll throw at all:\n"+
		"I have a thousand spirits in one breast,\n"+
		"To answer twenty thousand such as you.\n"+
		"DUKE OF SURREY\n"+
		"My Lord Fitzwater, I do remember well\n"+
		"The very time Aumerle and you did talk.\n"+
		"LORD FITZWATER\n"+
		"'Tis very true: you were in presence then;\n"+
		"And you can witness with me this is true.\n"+
		"DUKE OF SURREY\n"+
		"As false, by heaven, as heaven itself is true.\n"+
		"LORD FITZWATER\n"+
		"Surrey, thou liest.\n"+
		"DUKE OF SURREY\n"+
		"Dishonourable boy!\n"+
		"That lie shall lie so heavy on my sword,\n"+
		"That it shall render vengeance and revenge\n"+
		"Till thou the lie-giver and that lie do lie\n"+
		"In earth as quiet as thy father's skull:\n"+
		"In proof whereof, there is my honour's pawn;\n"+
		"Engage it to the trial, if thou darest.\n"+
		"LORD FITZWATER\n"+
		"How fondly dost thou spur a forward horse!\n"+
		"If I dare eat, or drink, or breathe, or live,\n"+
		"I dare meet Surrey in a wilderness,\n"+
		"And spit upon him, whilst I say he lies,\n"+
		"And lies, and lies: there is my bond of faith,\n"+
		"To tie thee to my strong correction.\n"+
		"As I intend to thrive in this new world,\n"+
		"Aumerle is guilty of my true appeal:\n"+
		"Besides, I heard the banish'd Norfolk say\n"+
		"That thou, Aumerle, didst send two of thy men\n"+
		"To execute the noble duke at Calais.\n"+
		"DUKE OF AUMERLE\n"+
		"Some honest Christian trust me with a gage\n"+
		"That Norfolk lies: here do I throw down this,\n"+
		"If he may be repeal'd, to try his honour.\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"These differences shall all rest under gage\n"+
		"Till Norfolk be repeal'd: repeal'd he shall be,\n"+
		"And, though mine enemy, restored again\n"+
		"To all his lands and signories: when he's return'd,\n"+
		"Against Aumerle we will enforce his trial.\n"+
		"BISHOP OF CARLISLE\n"+
		"That honourable day shall ne'er be seen.\n"+
		"Many a time hath banish'd Norfolk fought\n"+
		"For Jesu Christ in glorious Christian field,\n"+
		"Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross\n"+
		"Against black pagans, Turks, and Saracens:\n"+
		"And toil'd with works of war, retired himself\n"+
		"To Italy; and there at Venice gave\n"+
		"His body to that pleasant country's earth,\n"+
		"And his pure soul unto his captain Christ,\n"+
		"Under whose colours he had fought so long.\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"Why, bishop, is Norfolk dead?\n"+
		"BISHOP OF CARLISLE\n"+
		"As surely as I live, my lord.\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"Sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom\n"+
		"Of good old Abraham! Lords appellants,\n"+
		"Your differences shall all rest under gage\n"+
		"Till we assign you to your days of trial.\n"+
		"Enter DUKE OF YORK, attended\n"+
		"DUKE OF YORK\n"+
		"Great Duke of Lancaster, I come to thee\n"+
		"From plume-pluck'd Richard; who with willing soul\n"+
		"Adopts thee heir, and his high sceptre yields\n"+
		"To the possession of thy royal hand:\n"+
		"Ascend his throne, descending now from him;\n"+
		"And long live Henry, fourth of that name!\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"In God's name, I'll ascend the regal throne.\n"+
		"BISHOP OF CARLISLE\n"+
		"Marry. God forbid!\n"+
		"Worst in this royal presence may I speak,\n"+
		"Yet best beseeming me to speak the truth.\n"+
		"Would God that any in this noble presence\n"+
		"Were enough noble to be upright judge\n"+
		"Of noble Richard! then true noblesse would\n"+
		"Learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong.\n"+
		"What subject can give sentence on his king?\n"+
		"And who sits here that is not Richard's subject?\n"+
		"Thieves are not judged but they are by to hear,\n"+
		"Although apparent guilt be seen in them;\n"+
		"And shall the figure of God's majesty,\n"+
		"His captain, steward, deputy-elect,\n"+
		"Anointed, crowned, planted many years,\n"+
		"Be judged by subject and inferior breath,\n"+
		"And he himself not present? O, forfend it, God,\n"+
		"That in a Christian climate souls refined\n"+
		"Should show so heinous, black, obscene a deed!\n"+
		"I speak to subjects, and a subject speaks,\n"+
		"Stirr'd up by God, thus boldly for his king:\n"+
		"My Lord of Hereford here, whom you call king,\n"+
		"Is a foul traitor to proud Hereford's king:\n"+
		"And if you crown him, let me prophesy:\n"+
		"The blood of English shall manure the ground,\n"+
		"And future ages groan for this foul act;\n"+
		"Peace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels,\n"+
		"And in this seat of peace tumultuous wars\n"+
		"Shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound;\n"+
		"Disorder, horror, fear and mutiny\n"+
		"Shall here inhabit, and this land be call'd\n"+
		"The field of Golgotha and dead men's skulls.\n"+
		"O, if you raise this house against this house,\n"+
		"It will the woefullest division prove\n"+
		"That ever fell upon this cursed earth.\n"+
		"Prevent it, resist it, let it not be so,\n"+
		"Lest child, child's children, cry against you woe!\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"Well have you argued, sir; and, for your pains,\n"+
		"Of capital treason we arrest you here.\n"+
		"My Lord of Westminster, be it your charge\n"+
		"To keep him safely till his day of trial.\n"+
		"May it please you, lords, to grant the commons' suit.\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"Fetch hither Richard, that in common view\n"+
		"He may surrender; so we shall proceed\n"+
		"Without suspicion.\n"+
		"DUKE OF YORK\n"+
		"I will be his conduct.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"Lords, you that here are under our arrest,\n"+
		"Procure your sureties for your days of answer.\n"+
		"Little are we beholding to your love,\n"+
		"And little look'd for at your helping hands.\n"+
		"Re-enter DUKE OF YORK, with KING RICHARD II, and Officers bearing the regalia\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Alack, why am I sent for to a king,\n"+
		"Before I have shook off the regal thoughts\n"+
		"Wherewith I reign'd? I hardly yet have learn'd\n"+
		"To insinuate, flatter, bow, and bend my limbs:\n"+
		"Give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me\n"+
		"To this submission. Yet I well remember\n"+
		"The favours of these men: were they not mine?\n"+
		"Did they not sometime cry, 'all hail!' to me?\n"+
		"So Judas did to Christ: but he, in twelve,\n"+
		"Found truth in all but one: I, in twelve thousand, none.\n"+
		"God save the king! Will no man say amen?\n"+
		"Am I both priest and clerk? well then, amen.\n"+
		"God save the king! although I be not he;\n"+
		"And yet, amen, if heaven do think him me.\n"+
		"To do what service am I sent for hither?\n"+
		"DUKE OF YORK\n"+
		"To do that office of thine own good will\n"+
		"Which tired majesty did make thee offer,\n"+
		"The resignation of thy state and crown\n"+
		"To Henry Bolingbroke.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Give me the crown. Here, cousin, seize the crown;\n"+
		"Here cousin:\n"+
		"On this side my hand, and on that side yours.\n"+
		"Now is this golden crown like a deep well\n"+
		"That owes two buckets, filling one another,\n"+
		"The emptier ever dancing in the air,\n"+
		"The other down, unseen and full of water:\n"+
		"That bucket down and full of tears am I,\n"+
		"Drinking my griefs, whilst you mount up on high.\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"I thought you had been willing to resign.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"My crown I am; but still my griefs are mine:\n"+
		"You may my glories and my state depose,\n"+
		"But not my griefs; still am I king of those.\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"Part of your cares you give me with your crown.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down.\n"+
		"My care is loss of care, by old care done;\n"+
		"Your care is gain of care, by new care won:\n"+
		"The cares I give I have, though given away;\n"+
		"They tend the crown, yet still with me they stay.\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"Are you contented to resign the crown?\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Ay, no; no, ay; for I must nothing be;\n"+
		"Therefore no no, for I resign to thee.\n"+
		"Now mark me, how I will undo myself;\n"+
		"I give this heavy weight from off my head\n"+
		"And this unwieldy sceptre from my hand,\n"+
		"The pride of kingly sway from out my heart;\n"+
		"With mine own tears I wash away my balm,\n"+
		"With mine own hands I give away my crown,\n"+
		"With mine own tongue deny my sacred state,\n"+
		"With mine own breath release all duty's rites:\n"+
		"All pomp and majesty I do forswear;\n"+
		"My manors, rents, revenues I forego;\n"+
		"My acts, decrees, and statutes I deny:\n"+
		"God pardon all oaths that are broke to me!\n"+
		"God keep all vows unbroke that swear to thee!\n"+
		"Make me, that nothing have, with nothing grieved,\n"+
		"And thou with all pleased, that hast all achieved!\n"+
		"Long mayst thou live in Richard's seat to sit,\n"+
		"And soon lie Richard in an earthly pit!\n"+
		"God save King Harry, unking'd Richard says,\n"+
		"And send him many years of sunshine days!\n"+
		"What more remains?\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"No more, but that you read\n"+
		"These accusations and these grievous crimes\n"+
		"Committed by your person and your followers\n"+
		"Against the state and profit of this land;\n"+
		"That, by confessing them, the souls of men\n"+
		"May deem that you are worthily deposed.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Must I do so? and must I ravel out\n"+
		"My weaved-up folly? Gentle Northumberland,\n"+
		"If thy offences were upon record,\n"+
		"Would it not shame thee in so fair a troop\n"+
		"To read a lecture of them? If thou wouldst,\n"+
		"There shouldst thou find one heinous article,\n"+
		"Containing the deposing of a king\n"+
		"And cracking the strong warrant of an oath,\n"+
		"Mark'd with a blot, damn'd in the book of heaven:\n"+
		"Nay, all of you that stand and look upon,\n"+
		"Whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself,\n"+
		"Though some of you with Pilate wash your hands\n"+
		"Showing an outward pity; yet you Pilates\n"+
		"Have here deliver'd me to my sour cross,\n"+
		"And water cannot wash away your sin.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"My lord, dispatch; read o'er these articles.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Mine eyes are full of tears, I cannot see:\n"+
		"And yet salt water blinds them not so much\n"+
		"But they can see a sort of traitors here.\n"+
		"Nay, if I turn mine eyes upon myself,\n"+
		"I find myself a traitor with the rest;\n"+
		"For I have given here my soul's consent\n"+
		"To undeck the pompous body of a king;\n"+
		"Made glory base and sovereignty a slave,\n"+
		"Proud majesty a subject, state a peasant.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"My lord,--\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"No lord of thine, thou haught insulting man,\n"+
		"Nor no man's lord; I have no name, no title,\n"+
		"No, not that name was given me at the font,\n"+
		"But 'tis usurp'd: alack the heavy day,\n"+
		"That I have worn so many winters out,\n"+
		"And know not now what name to call myself!\n"+
		"O that I were a mockery king of snow,\n"+
		"Standing before the sun of Bolingbroke,\n"+
		"To melt myself away in water-drops!\n"+
		"Good king, great king, and yet not greatly good,\n"+

		"Give me the glass, and therein will I read.\n"+
		"No deeper wrinkles yet? hath sorrow struck\n"+

		"Was this the face that faced so many follies,\n"+

		"A brittle glory shineth in this face:\n"+
		"As brittle as the glory is the face;\n"+
		"Dashes the glass against the ground\n"+

		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"The shadow of your sorrow hath destroy'd\n"+

		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Say that again.\n"+
		"The shadow of my sorrow! ha! let's see:\n"+
		"'Tis very true, my grief lies all within;\n"+
		"And these external manners of laments\n"+

		"A woeful pageant have we here beheld.\n"+
		"BISHOP OF CARLISLE\n"+
		"The woe's to come; the children yet unborn.\n"+

		"To rid the realm of this pernicious blot?\n"+
		"Abbot\n"+
		"My lord,\n"+
		"Before I freely speak my mind herein,\n"+

		"Enter QUEEN and Ladies\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"This way the king will come; this is the way\n"+
		"To Julius Caesar's ill-erected tower,\n"+
		"To whose flint bosom my condemned lord\n"+
		"Is doom'd a prisoner by proud Bolingbroke:\n"+
		"Here let us rest, if this rebellious earth\n"+
		"Have any resting for her true king's queen.\n"+
		"Enter KING RICHARD II and Guard\n"+
		"But soft, but see, or rather do not see,\n"+
		"My fair rose wither: yet look up, behold,\n"+
		"That you in pity may dissolve to dew,\n"+
		"And wash him fresh again with true-love tears.\n"+
		"Ah, thou, the model where old Troy did stand,\n"+
		"Thou map of honour, thou King Richard's tomb,\n"+
		"And not King Richard; thou most beauteous inn,\n"+
		"Why should hard-favour'd grief be lodged in thee,\n"+
		"When triumph is become an alehouse guest?\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Join not with grief, fair woman, do not so,\n"+
		"To make my end too sudden: learn, good soul,\n"+
		"To think our former state a happy dream;\n"+
		"From which awaked, the truth of what we are\n"+
		"Shows us but this: I am sworn brother, sweet,\n"+
		"To grim Necessity, and he and I\n"+
		"Will keep a league till death. Hie thee to France\n"+
		"And cloister thee in some religious house:\n"+
		"Our holy lives must win a new world's crown,\n"+
		"Which our profane hours here have stricken down.\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"What, is my Richard both in shape and mind\n"+
		"Transform'd and weaken'd? hath Bolingbroke deposed\n"+
		"Thine intellect? hath he been in thy heart?\n"+
		"The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw,\n"+
		"And wounds the earth, if nothing else, with rage\n"+
		"To be o'erpower'd; and wilt thou, pupil-like,\n"+
		"Take thy correction mildly, kiss the rod,\n"+
		"And fawn on rage with base humility,\n"+
		"Which art a lion and a king of beasts?\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"A king of beasts, indeed; if aught but beasts,\n"+
		"I had been still a happy king of men.\n"+
		"Good sometime queen, prepare thee hence for France:\n"+
		"Think I am dead and that even here thou takest,\n"+
		"As from my death-bed, thy last living leave.\n"+
		"In winter's tedious nights sit by the fire\n"+
		"With good old folks and let them tell thee tales\n"+
		"Of woeful ages long ago betid;\n"+
		"And ere thou bid good night, to quit their griefs,\n"+
		"Tell thou the lamentable tale of me\n"+
		"And send the hearers weeping to their beds:\n"+
		"For why, the senseless brands will sympathize\n"+
		"The heavy accent of thy moving tongue\n"+
		"And in compassion weep the fire out;\n"+
		"And some will mourn in ashes, some coal-black,\n"+
		"For the deposing of a rightful king.\n"+
		"Enter NORTHUMBERLAND and others\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"My lord, the mind of Bolingbroke is changed:\n"+
		"You must to Pomfret, not unto the Tower.\n"+
		"And, madam, there is order ta'en for you;\n"+
		"With all swift speed you must away to France.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Northumberland, thou ladder wherewithal\n"+
		"The mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne,\n"+
		"The time shall not be many hours of age\n"+
		"More than it is ere foul sin gathering head\n"+
		"Shalt break into corruption: thou shalt think,\n"+
		"Though he divide the realm and give thee half,\n"+
		"It is too little, helping him to all;\n"+
		"And he shall think that thou, which know'st the way\n"+
		"To plant unrightful kings, wilt know again,\n"+
		"Being ne'er so little urged, another way\n"+
		"To pluck him headlong from the usurped throne.\n"+
		"The love of wicked men converts to fear;\n"+
		"That fear to hate, and hate turns one or both\n"+
		"To worthy danger and deserved death.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"My guilt be on my head, and there an end.\n"+
		"Take leave and part; for you must part forthwith.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Doubly divorced! Bad men, you violate\n"+
		"A twofold marriage, 'twixt my crown and me,\n"+
		"And then betwixt me and my married wife.\n"+
		"Let me unkiss the oath 'twixt thee and me;\n"+
		"And yet not so, for with a kiss 'twas made.\n"+
		"Part us, Northumberland; I toward the north,\n"+
		"Where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime;\n"+
		"My wife to France: from whence, set forth in pomp,\n"+
		"She came adorned hither like sweet May,\n"+
		"Sent back like Hallowmas or short'st of day.\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"And must we be divided? must we part?\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Ay, hand from hand, my love, and heart from heart.\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"Banish us both and send the king with me.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"That were some love but little policy.\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"Then whither he goes, thither let me go.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"So two, together weeping, make one woe.\n"+
		"Weep thou for me in France, I for thee here;\n"+
		"Better far off than near, be ne'er the near.\n"+
		"Go, count thy way with sighs; I mine with groans.\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"So longest way shall have the longest moans.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Twice for one step I'll groan, the way being short,\n"+
		"And piece the way out with a heavy heart.\n"+
		"Come, come, in wooing sorrow let's be brief,\n"+
		"Since, wedding it, there is such length in grief;\n"+
		"One kiss shall stop our mouths, and dumbly part;\n"+
		"Thus give I mine, and thus take I thy heart.\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"Give me mine own again; 'twere no good part\n"+
		"To take on me to keep and kill thy heart.\n"+
		"So, now I have mine own again, be gone,\n"+
		"That I might strive to kill it with a groan.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"We make woe wanton with this fond delay:\n"+
		"Once more, adieu; the rest let sorrow say.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. The DUKE OF YORK's palace.\n"+
		"Enter DUKE OF YORK and DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"My lord, you told me you would tell the rest,\n"+
		"When weeping made you break the story off,\n"+
		"of our two cousins coming into London.\n"+
		"DUKE OF YORK\n"+
		"Where did I leave?\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"At that sad stop, my lord,\n"+
		"Where rude misgovern'd hands from windows' tops\n"+
		"Threw dust and rubbish on King Richard's head.\n"+
		"DUKE OF YORK\n"+
		"Then, as I said, the duke, great Bolingbroke,\n"+
		"Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed\n"+
		"Which his aspiring rider seem'd to know,\n"+
		"With slow but stately pace kept on his course,\n"+
		"Whilst all tongues cried 'God save thee,\n"+
		"Bolingbroke!'\n"+
		"You would have thought the very windows spake,\n"+
		"So many greedy looks of young and old\n"+
		"Through casements darted their desiring eyes\n"+
		"Upon his visage, and that all the walls\n"+
		"With painted imagery had said at once\n"+
		"'Jesu preserve thee! welcome, Bolingbroke!'\n"+
		"Whilst he, from the one side to the other turning,\n"+
		"Bareheaded, lower than his proud steed's neck,\n"+
		"Bespake them thus: 'I thank you, countrymen:'\n"+
		"And thus still doing, thus he pass'd along.\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"Alack, poor Richard! where rode he the whilst?\n"+
		"DUKE OF YORK\n"+
		"As in a theatre, the eyes of men,\n"+
		"After a well-graced actor leaves the stage,\n"+
		"Are idly bent on him that enters next,\n"+
		"Thinking his prattle to be tedious;\n"+
		"Even so, or with much more contempt, men's eyes\n"+
		"Did scowl on gentle Richard; no man cried 'God save him!'\n"+
		"No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home:\n"+
		"But dust was thrown upon his sacred head:\n"+
		"Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off,\n"+
		"His face still combating with tears and smiles,\n"+
		"The badges of his grief and patience,\n"+
		"That had not God, for some strong purpose, steel'd\n"+
		"The hearts of men, they must perforce have melted\n"+
		"And barbarism itself have pitied him.\n"+
		"But heaven hath a hand in these events,\n"+
		"To whose high will we bound our calm contents.\n"+
		"To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now,\n"+
		"Whose state and honour I for aye allow.\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"Here comes my son Aumerle.\n"+
		"DUKE OF YORK\n"+
		"Aumerle that was;\n"+
		"But that is lost for being Richard's friend,\n"+
		"And, madam, you must call him Rutland now:\n"+
		"I am in parliament pledge for his truth\n"+
		"And lasting fealty to the new-made king.\n"+
		"Enter DUKE OF AUMERLE\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"Welcome, my son: who are the violets now\n"+
		"That strew the green lap of the new come spring?\n"+
		"DUKE OF AUMERLE\n"+
		"Madam, I know not, nor I greatly care not:\n"+
		"God knows I had as lief be none as one.\n"+
		"DUKE OF YORK\n"+
		"Well, bear you well in this new spring of time,\n"+
		"Lest you be cropp'd before you come to prime.\n"+
		"What news from Oxford? hold those justs and triumphs?\n"+
		"DUKE OF AUMERLE\n"+
		"For aught I know, my lord, they do.\n"+
		"DUKE OF YORK\n"+
		"You will be there, I know.\n"+
		"DUKE OF AUMERLE\n"+
		"If God prevent not, I purpose so.\n"+
		"DUKE OF YORK\n"+
		"What seal is that, that hangs without thy bosom?\n"+
		"Yea, look'st thou pale? let me see the writing.\n"+
		"DUKE OF AUMERLE\n"+
		"My lord, 'tis nothing.\n"+
		"DUKE OF YORK\n"+
		"No matter, then, who see it;\n"+
		"I will be satisfied; let me see the writing.\n"+
		"DUKE OF AUMERLE\n"+
		"I do beseech your grace to pardon me:\n"+
		"It is a matter of small consequence,\n"+
		"Which for some reasons I would not have seen.\n"+
		"DUKE OF YORK\n"+
		"Which for some reasons, sir, I mean to see.\n"+
		"I fear, I fear,--\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"What should you fear?\n"+
		"'Tis nothing but some bond, that he is enter'd into\n"+
		"For gay apparel 'gainst the triumph day.\n"+
		"DUKE OF YORK\n"+
		"Bound to himself! what doth he with a bond\n"+
		"That he is bound to? Wife, thou art a fool.\n"+
		"Boy, let me see the writing.\n"+
		"DUKE OF AUMERLE\n"+
		"I do beseech you, pardon me; I may not show it.\n"+
		"DUKE OF YORK\n"+
		"I will be satisfied; let me see it, I say.\n"+
		"He plucks it out of his bosom and reads it\n"+
		"Treason! foul treason! Villain! traitor! slave!\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"What is the matter, my lord?\n"+
		"DUKE OF YORK\n"+
		"Ho! who is within there?\n"+
		"Enter a Servant\n"+
		"Saddle my horse.\n"+
		"God for his mercy, what treachery is here!\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"Why, what is it, my lord?\n"+
		"DUKE OF YORK\n"+
		"Give me my boots, I say; saddle my horse.\n"+
		"Now, by mine honour, by my life, by my troth,\n"+
		"I will appeach the villain.\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"What is the matter?\n"+
		"DUKE OF YORK\n"+
		"Peace, foolish woman.\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"I will not peace. What is the matter, Aumerle.\n"+
		"DUKE OF AUMERLE\n"+
		"Good mother, be content; it is no more\n"+
		"Than my poor life must answer.\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"Thy life answer!\n"+
		"DUKE OF YORK\n"+
		"Bring me my boots: I will unto the king.\n"+
		"Re-enter Servant with boots\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"Strike him, Aumerle. Poor boy, thou art amazed.\n"+
		"Hence, villain! never more come in my sight.\n"+
		"DUKE OF YORK\n"+
		"Give me my boots, I say.\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"Why, York, what wilt thou do?\n"+
		"Wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own?\n"+
		"Have we more sons? or are we like to have?\n"+
		"Is not my teeming date drunk up with time?\n"+
		"And wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age,\n"+
		"And rob me of a happy mother's name?\n"+
		"Is he not like thee? is he not thine own?\n"+
		"DUKE OF YORK\n"+
		"Thou fond mad woman,\n"+
		"Wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy?\n"+
		"A dozen of them here have ta'en the sacrament,\n"+
		"And interchangeably set down their hands,\n"+
		"To kill the king at Oxford.\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"He shall be none;\n"+
		"We'll keep him here: then what is that to him?\n"+
		"DUKE OF YORK\n"+
		"Away, fond woman! were he twenty times my son,\n"+
		"I would appeach him.\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"Hadst thou groan'd for him\n"+
		"As I have done, thou wouldst be more pitiful.\n"+
		"But now I know thy mind; thou dost suspect\n"+
		"That I have been disloyal to thy bed,\n"+
		"And that he is a bastard, not thy son:\n"+
		"Sweet York, sweet husband, be not of that mind:\n"+
		"He is as like thee as a man may be,\n"+
		"Not like to me, or any of my kin,\n"+
		"And yet I love him.\n"+
		"DUKE OF YORK\n"+
		"Make way, unruly woman!\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"After, Aumerle! mount thee upon his horse;\n"+
		"Spur post, and get before him to the king,\n"+
		"And beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee.\n"+
		"I'll not be long behind; though I be old,\n"+
		"I doubt not but to ride as fast as York:\n"+
		"And never will I rise up from the ground\n"+
		"Till Bolingbroke have pardon'd thee. Away, be gone!\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+

		"With unrestrained loose companions,\n"+
		"Even such, they say, as stand in narrow lanes,\n"+

		"So dissolute a crew.\n"+
		"HENRY PERCY\n"+
		"My lord, some two days since I saw the prince,\n"+

		"And what said the gallant?\n"+
		"HENRY PERCY\n"+
		"His answer was, he would unto the stews,\n"+
		"And from the common'st creature pluck a glove,\n"+
		"And wear it as a favour; and with that\n"+
		"He would unhorse the lustiest challenger.\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"As dissolute as desperate; yet through both\n"+

		"Unto my mother's prayers I bend my knee.\n"+
		"DUKE OF YORK\n"+
		"Against them both my true joints bended be.\n"+
		"Ill mayst thou thrive, if thou grant any grace!\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"Pleads he in earnest? look upon his face;\n"+
		"His eyes do drop no tears, his prayers are in jest;\n"+
		"His words come from his mouth, ours from our breast:\n"+
		"He prays but faintly and would be denied;\n"+
		"We pray with heart and soul and all beside:\n"+
		"His weary joints would gladly rise, I know;\n"+
		"Our knees shall kneel till to the ground they grow:\n"+
		"His prayers are full of false hypocrisy;\n"+
		"Ours of true zeal and deep integrity.\n"+
		"Our prayers do out-pray his; then let them have\n"+
		"That mercy which true prayer ought to have.\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"Good aunt, stand up.\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"Nay, do not say, 'stand up;'\n"+
		"Say, 'pardon' first, and afterwards 'stand up.'\n"+
		"And if I were thy nurse, thy tongue to teach,\n"+
		"'Pardon' should be the first word of thy speech.\n"+
		"I never long'd to hear a word till now;\n"+
		"Say 'pardon,' king; let pity teach thee how:\n"+
		"The word is short, but not so short as sweet;\n"+
		"No word like 'pardon' for kings' mouths so meet.\n"+
		"DUKE OF YORK\n"+
		"Speak it in French, king; say, 'pardonne moi.'\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?\n"+
		"Ah, my sour husband, my hard-hearted lord,\n"+
		"That set'st the word itself against the word!\n"+
		"Speak 'pardon' as 'tis current in our land;\n"+
		"The chopping French we do not understand.\n"+
		"Thine eye begins to speak; set thy tongue there;\n"+
		"Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear;\n"+
		"That hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce,\n"+
		"Pity may move thee 'pardon' to rehearse.\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"Good aunt, stand up.\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"I do not sue to stand;\n"+
		"Pardon is all the suit I have in hand.\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"I pardon him, as God shall pardon me.\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"O happy vantage of a kneeling knee!\n"+
		"Yet am I sick for fear: speak it again;\n"+
		"Twice saying 'pardon' doth not pardon twain,\n"+
		"But makes one pardon strong.\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"With all my heart\n"+
		"I pardon him.\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"A god on earth thou art.\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"But for our trusty brother-in-law and the abbot,\n"+
		"With all the rest of that consorted crew,\n"+
		"Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels.\n"+
		"Good uncle, help to order several powers\n"+
		"To Oxford, or where'er these traitors are:\n"+
		"They shall not live within this world, I swear,\n"+
		"But I will have them, if I once know where.\n"+
		"Uncle, farewell: and, cousin too, adieu:\n"+
		"Your mother well hath pray'd, and prove you true.\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"Come, my old son: I pray God make thee new.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV. The same.\n"+
		"Enter EXTON and Servant\n"+
		"EXTON\n"+
		"Didst thou not mark the king, what words he spake,\n"+
		"'Have I no friend will rid me of this living fear?'\n"+
		"Was it not so?\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"These were his very words.\n"+
		"EXTON\n"+
		"'Have I no friend?' quoth he: he spake it twice,\n"+
		"And urged it twice together, did he not?\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"He did.\n"+
		"EXTON\n"+
		"And speaking it, he wistly look'd on me,\n"+
		"And who should say, 'I would thou wert the man'\n"+
		"That would divorce this terror from my heart;'\n"+
		"Meaning the king at Pomfret. Come, let's go:\n"+
		"I am the king's friend, and will rid his foe.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE V. Pomfret castle.\n"+
		"Enter KING RICHARD\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"I have been studying how I may compare\n"+
		"This prison where I live unto the world:\n"+
		"And for because the world is populous\n"+
		"And here is not a creature but myself,\n"+
		"I cannot do it; yet I'll hammer it out.\n"+
		"My brain I'll prove the female to my soul,\n"+
		"My soul the father; and these two beget\n"+
		"A generation of still-breeding thoughts,\n"+
		"And these same thoughts people this little world,\n"+
		"In humours like the people of this world,\n"+
		"For no thought is contented. The better sort,\n"+
		"As thoughts of things divine, are intermix'd\n"+
		"With scruples and do set the word itself\n"+
		"Against the word:\n"+
		"As thus, 'Come, little ones,' and then again,\n"+
		"'It is as hard to come as for a camel\n"+
		"To thread the postern of a small needle's eye.'\n"+
		"Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot\n"+
		"Unlikely wonders; how these vain weak nails\n"+
		"May tear a passage through the flinty ribs\n"+
		"Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls,\n"+
		"And, for they cannot, die in their own pride.\n"+
		"Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves\n"+
		"That they are not the first of fortune's slaves,\n"+
		"Nor shall not be the last; like silly beggars\n"+
		"Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame,\n"+
		"That many have and others must sit there;\n"+
		"And in this thought they find a kind of ease,\n"+
		"Bearing their own misfortunes on the back\n"+
		"Of such as have before endured the like.\n"+
		"Thus play I in one person many people,\n"+
		"And none contented: sometimes am I king;\n"+
		"Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,\n"+
		"And so I am: then crushing penury\n"+
		"Persuades me I was better when a king;\n"+
		"Then am I king'd again: and by and by\n"+
		"Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke,\n"+
		"And straight am nothing: but whate'er I be,\n"+
		"Nor I nor any man that but man is\n"+
		"With nothing shall be pleased, till he be eased\n"+
		"With being nothing. Music do I hear?\n"+
		"Music\n"+
		"Ha, ha! keep time: how sour sweet music is,\n"+
		"When time is broke and no proportion kept!\n"+
		"So is it in the music of men's lives.\n"+
		"And here have I the daintiness of ear\n"+
		"To cheque time broke in a disorder'd string;\n"+
		"But for the concord of my state and time\n"+
		"Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.\n"+
		"I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;\n"+
		"For now hath time made me his numbering clock:\n"+
		"My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar\n"+
		"Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,\n"+
		"Whereto my finger, like a dial's point,\n"+
		"Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.\n"+
		"Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is\n"+
		"Are clamorous groans, which strike upon my heart,\n"+
		"Which is the bell: so sighs and tears and groans\n"+
		"Show minutes, times, and hours: but my time\n"+
		"Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy,\n"+
		"While I stand fooling here, his Jack o' the clock.\n"+
		"This music mads me; let it sound no more;\n"+
		"For though it have holp madmen to their wits,\n"+
		"In me it seems it will make wise men mad.\n"+
		"Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!\n"+
		"For 'tis a sign of love; and love to Richard\n"+
		"Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world.\n"+
		"Enter a Groom of the Stable\n"+
		"Groom\n"+
		"Hail, royal prince!\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Thanks, noble peer;\n"+
		"The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear.\n"+
		"What art thou? and how comest thou hither,\n"+
		"Where no man never comes but that sad dog\n"+
		"That brings me food to make misfortune live?\n"+
		"Groom\n"+
		"I was a poor groom of thy stable, king,\n"+
		"When thou wert king; who, travelling towards York,\n"+
		"With much ado at length have gotten leave\n"+
		"To look upon my sometimes royal master's face.\n"+
		"O, how it yearn'd my heart when I beheld\n"+
		"In London streets, that coronation-day,\n"+
		"When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary,\n"+
		"That horse that thou so often hast bestrid,\n"+
		"That horse that I so carefully have dress'd!\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Rode he on Barbary? Tell me, gentle friend,\n"+
		"How went he under him?\n"+
		"Groom\n"+
		"So proudly as if he disdain'd the ground.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back!\n"+
		"That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand;\n"+
		"This hand hath made him proud with clapping him.\n"+
		"Would he not stumble? would he not fall down,\n"+
		"Since pride must have a fall, and break the neck\n"+
		"Of that proud man that did usurp his back?\n"+
		"Forgiveness, horse! why do I rail on thee,\n"+
		"Since thou, created to be awed by man,\n"+
		"Wast born to bear? I was not made a horse;\n"+
		"And yet I bear a burthen like an ass,\n"+
		"Spurr'd, gall'd and tired by jouncing Bolingbroke.\n"+
		"Enter Keeper, with a dish\n"+
		"Keeper\n"+
		"Fellow, give place; here is no longer stay.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"If thou love me, 'tis time thou wert away.\n"+
		"Groom\n"+
		"What my tongue dares not, that my heart shall say.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"Keeper\n"+
		"My lord, will't please you to fall to?\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"Taste of it first, as thou art wont to do.\n"+
		"Keeper\n"+
		"My lord, I dare not: Sir Pierce of Exton, who\n"+
		"lately came from the king, commands the contrary.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"The devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee!\n"+
		"Patience is stale, and I am weary of it.\n"+
		"Beats the keeper\n"+
		"Keeper\n"+
		"Help, help, help!\n"+
		"Enter EXTON and Servants, armed\n"+
		"KING RICHARD II\n"+
		"How now! what means death in this rude assault?\n"+
		"Villain, thy own hand yields thy death's instrument.\n"+
		"Snatching an axe from a Servant and killing him\n"+
		"Go thou, and fill another room in hell.\n"+
		"He kills another. Then Exton strikes him down\n"+
		"That hand shall burn in never-quenching fire\n"+
		"That staggers thus my person. Exton, thy fierce hand\n"+
		"Hath with the king's blood stain'd the king's own land.\n"+
		"Mount, mount, my soul! thy seat is up on high;\n"+
		"Whilst my gross flesh sinks downward, here to die.\n"+
		"Dies\n"+
		"EXTON\n"+
		"As full of valour as of royal blood:\n"+
		"Both have I spill'd; O would the deed were good!\n"+
		"For now the devil, that told me I did well,\n"+
		"Says that this deed is chronicled in hell.\n"+
		"This dead king to the living king I'll bear\n"+
		"Take hence the rest, and give them burial here.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE VI. Windsor castle.\n"+
		"Flourish. Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE, DUKE OF YORK, with other Lords, and Attendants\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"Kind uncle York, the latest news we hear\n"+
		"Is that the rebels have consumed with fire\n"+
		"Our town of Cicester in Gloucestershire;\n"+
		"But whether they be ta'en or slain we hear not.\n"+
		"Enter NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"Welcome, my lord what is the news?\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"First, to thy sacred state wish I all happiness.\n"+
		"The next news is, I have to London sent\n"+
		"The heads of Oxford, Salisbury, Blunt, and Kent:\n"+
		"The manner of their taking may appear\n"+
		"At large discoursed in this paper here.\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"We thank thee, gentle Percy, for thy pains;\n"+
		"And to thy worth will add right worthy gains.\n"+
		"Enter LORD FITZWATER\n"+
		"LORD FITZWATER\n"+
		"My lord, I have from Oxford sent to London\n"+
		"The heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely,\n"+
		"Two of the dangerous consorted traitors\n"+
		"That sought at Oxford thy dire overthrow.\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"Thy pains, Fitzwater, shall not be forgot;\n"+
		"Right noble is thy merit, well I wot.\n"+
		"Enter HENRY PERCY, and the BISHOP OF CARLISLE\n"+
		"HENRY PERCY\n"+
		"The grand conspirator, Abbot of Westminster,\n"+
		"With clog of conscience and sour melancholy\n"+
		"Hath yielded up his body to the grave;\n"+
		"But here is Carlisle living, to abide\n"+
		"Thy kingly doom and sentence of his pride.\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"Carlisle, this is your doom:\n"+
		"Choose out some secret place, some reverend room,\n"+
		"More than thou hast, and with it joy thy life;\n"+
		"So as thou livest in peace, die free from strife:\n"+
		"For though mine enemy thou hast ever been,\n"+
		"High sparks of honour in thee have I seen.\n"+
		"Enter EXTON, with persons bearing a coffin\n"+
		"EXTON\n"+
		"Great king, within this coffin I present\n"+
		"Thy buried fear: herein all breathless lies\n"+
		"The mightiest of thy greatest enemies,\n"+
		"Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought\n"+
		"A deed of slander with thy fatal hand\n"+
		"Upon my head and all this famous land.\n"+
		"EXTON\n"+
		"From your own mouth, my lord, did I this deed.\n"+
		"HENRY BOLINGBROKE\n"+
		"They love not poison that do poison need,\n"+
		"Nor do I thee: though I did wish him dead,\n"+
		"I hate the murderer, love him murdered.\n"+
		"The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour,\n"+
		"But neither my good word nor princely favour:\n"+
		"With Cain go wander through shades of night,\n"+
		"And never show thy head by day nor light.\n"+
		"Lords, I protest, my soul is full of woe,\n"+
		"That blood should sprinkle me to make me grow:\n"+
		"Come, mourn with me for that I do lament,\n"+
		"And put on sullen black incontinent:\n"+
		"I'll make a voyage to the Holy Land,\n"+
		"To wash this blood off from my guilty hand:\n"+
		"March sadly after; grace my mournings here;\n"+
		"In weeping after this untimely bier.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"
