		"Pericles, Prince of Tyre\n"+
		"ACT I\n"+
		"PROLOGUE\n"+
		"Enter GOWER\n"+
		"Before the palace of Antioch\n"+
		"To sing a song that old was sung,\n"+
		"From ashes ancient Gower is come;\n"+
		"Assuming man's infirmities,\n"+
		"To glad your ear, and please your eyes.\n"+
		"It hath been sung at festivals,\n"+
		"On ember-eves and holy-ales;\n"+
		"And lords and ladies in their lives\n"+
		"Have read it for restoratives:\n"+
		"The purchase is to make men glorious;\n"+
		"Et bonum quo antiquius, eo melius.\n"+
		"If you, born in these latter times,\n"+
		"When wit's more ripe, accept my rhymes.\n"+
		"And that to hear an old man sing\n"+
		"May to your wishes pleasure bring\n"+
		"I life would wish, and that I might\n"+
		"Waste it for you, like taper-light.\n"+
		"This Antioch, then, Antiochus the Great\n"+
		"Built up, this city, for his chiefest seat:\n"+
		"The fairest in all Syria,\n"+
		"I tell you what mine authors say:\n"+
		"This king unto him took a fere,\n"+
		"Who died and left a female heir,\n"+
		"So buxom, blithe, and full of face,\n"+
		"As heaven had lent her all his grace;\n"+
		"With whom the father liking took,\n"+
		"And her to incest did provoke:\n"+
		"Bad child; worse father! to entice his own\n"+
		"To evil should be done by none:\n"+
		"But custom what they did begin\n"+
		"Was with long use account no sin.\n"+
		"The beauty of this sinful dame\n"+
		"Made many princes thither frame,\n"+
		"To seek her as a bed-fellow,\n"+
		"In marriage-pleasures play-fellow:\n"+
		"Which to prevent he made a law,\n"+
		"To keep her still, and men in awe,\n"+
		"That whoso ask'd her for his wife,\n"+
		"His riddle told not, lost his life:\n"+
		"So for her many a wight did die,\n"+
		"As yon grim looks do testify.\n"+
		"What now ensues, to the judgment of your eye\n"+
		"I give, my cause who best can justify.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE I. Antioch. A room in the palace.\n"+
		"Enter ANTIOCHUS, Prince PERICLES, and followers\n"+
		"ANTIOCHUS\n"+
		"Young prince of Tyre, you have at large received\n"+
		"The danger of the task you undertake.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"I have, Antiochus, and, with a soul\n"+
		"Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,\n"+
		"Think death no hazard in this enterprise.\n"+
		"ANTIOCHUS\n"+
		"Bring in our daughter, clothed like a bride,\n"+
		"For the embracements even of Jove himself;\n"+
		"At whose conception, till Lucina reign'd,\n"+
		"Nature this dowry gave, to glad her presence,\n"+
		"The senate-house of planets all did sit,\n"+
		"To knit in her their best perfections.\n"+
		"Music. Enter the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"See where she comes, apparell'd like the spring,\n"+
		"Graces her subjects, and her thoughts the king\n"+
		"Of every virtue gives renown to men!\n"+
		"Her face the book of praises, where is read\n"+
		"Nothing but curious pleasures, as from thence\n"+
		"Sorrow were ever razed and testy wrath\n"+
		"Could never be her mild companion.\n"+
		"You gods that made me man, and sway in love,\n"+
		"That have inflamed desire in my breast\n"+
		"To taste the fruit of yon celestial tree,\n"+
		"Or die in the adventure, be my helps,\n"+
		"As I am son and servant to your will,\n"+
		"To compass such a boundless happiness!\n"+
		"ANTIOCHUS\n"+
		"Prince Pericles,--\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"That would be son to great Antiochus.\n"+
		"ANTIOCHUS\n"+
		"Before thee stands this fair Hesperides,\n"+
		"With golden fruit, but dangerous to be touch'd;\n"+
		"For death-like dragons here affright thee hard:\n"+
		"Her face, like heaven, enticeth thee to view\n"+
		"Her countless glory, which desert must gain;\n"+
		"And which, without desert, because thine eye\n"+
		"Presumes to reach, all thy whole heap must die.\n"+
		"Yon sometimes famous princes, like thyself,\n"+
		"Drawn by report, adventurous by desire,\n"+
		"Tell thee, with speechless tongues and semblance pale,\n"+
		"That without covering, save yon field of stars,\n"+
		"Here they stand martyrs, slain in Cupid's wars;\n"+
		"And with dead cheeks advise thee to desist\n"+
		"For going on death's net, whom none resist.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"Antiochus, I thank thee, who hath taught\n"+
		"My frail mortality to know itself,\n"+
		"And by those fearful objects to prepare\n"+
		"This body, like to them, to what I must;\n"+
		"For death remember'd should be like a mirror,\n"+
		"Who tells us life's but breath, to trust it error.\n"+
		"I'll make my will then, and, as sick men do\n"+
		"Who know the world, see heaven, but, feeling woe,\n"+
		"Gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did;\n"+
		"So I bequeath a happy peace to you\n"+
		"And all good men, as every prince should do;\n"+
		"My riches to the earth from whence they came;\n"+
		"But my unspotted fire of love to you.\n"+
		"To the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS\n"+
		"Thus ready for the way of life or death,\n"+
		"I wait the sharpest blow, Antiochus.\n"+
		"ANTIOCHUS\n"+
		"Scorning advice, read the conclusion then:\n"+
		"Which read and not expounded, 'tis decreed,\n"+
		"As these before thee thou thyself shalt bleed.\n"+
		"Daughter\n"+
		"Of all say'd yet, mayst thou prove prosperous!\n"+
		"Of all say'd yet, I wish thee happiness!\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"Like a bold champion, I assume the lists,\n"+
		"Nor ask advice of any other thought\n"+
		"But faithfulness and courage.\n"+
		"He reads the riddle\n"+
		"I am no viper, yet I feed\n"+
		"On mother's flesh which did me breed.\n"+
		"I sought a husband, in which labour\n"+
		"I found that kindness in a father:\n"+
		"He's father, son, and husband mild;\n"+
		"I mother, wife, and yet his child.\n"+
		"How they may be, and yet in two,\n"+
		"As you will live, resolve it you.\n"+
		"Sharp physic is the last: but, O you powers\n"+
		"That give heaven countless eyes to view men's acts,\n"+
		"Why cloud they not their sights perpetually,\n"+
		"If this be true, which makes me pale to read it?\n"+
		"Fair glass of light, I loved you, and could still,\n"+
		"Takes hold of the hand of the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS\n"+
		"Were not this glorious casket stored with ill:\n"+
		"But I must tell you, now my thoughts revolt\n"+
		"For he's no man on whom perfections wait\n"+
		"That, knowing sin within, will touch the gate.\n"+
		"You are a fair viol, and your sense the strings;\n"+
		"Who, finger'd to make man his lawful music,\n"+
		"Would draw heaven down, and all the gods, to hearken:\n"+
		"But being play'd upon before your time,\n"+
		"Hell only danceth at so harsh a chime.\n"+
		"Good sooth, I care not for you.\n"+
		"ANTIOCHUS\n"+
		"Prince Pericles, touch not, upon thy life.\n"+
		"For that's an article within our law,\n"+
		"As dangerous as the rest. Your time's expired:\n"+
		"Either expound now, or receive your sentence.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"Great king,\n"+
		"Few love to hear the sins they love to act;\n"+
		"'Twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it.\n"+
		"Who has a book of all that monarchs do,\n"+
		"He's more secure to keep it shut than shown:\n"+
		"For vice repeated is like the wandering wind.\n"+
		"Blows dust in other's eyes, to spread itself;\n"+
		"And yet the end of all is bought thus dear,\n"+
		"The breath is gone, and the sore eyes see clear:\n"+
		"To stop the air would hurt them. The blind mole casts\n"+
		"Copp'd hills towards heaven, to tell the earth is throng'd\n"+
		"By man's oppression; and the poor worm doth die for't.\n"+
		"Kings are earth's gods; in vice their law's\n"+
		"their will;\n"+
		"And if Jove stray, who dares say Jove doth ill?\n"+
		"It is enough you know; and it is fit,\n"+
		"What being more known grows worse, to smother it.\n"+
		"All love the womb that their first being bred,\n"+
		"Then give my tongue like leave to love my head.\n"+
		"ANTIOCHUS\n"+
		"[Aside] Heaven, that I had thy head! he has found\n"+
		"the meaning:\n"+
		"But I will gloze with him.--Young prince of Tyre,\n"+
		"Though by the tenor of our strict edict,\n"+
		"Your exposition misinterpreting,\n"+
		"We might proceed to cancel of your days;\n"+
		"Yet hope, succeeding from so fair a tree\n"+
		"As your fair self, doth tune us otherwise:\n"+
		"Forty days longer we do respite you;\n"+
		"If by which time our secret be undone,\n"+
		"This mercy shows we'll joy in such a son:\n"+
		"And until then your entertain shall be\n"+
		"As doth befit our honour and your worth.\n"+
		"Exeunt all but PERICLES\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"How courtesy would seem to cover sin,\n"+
		"When what is done is like an hypocrite,\n"+
		"The which is good in nothing but in sight!\n"+
		"If it be true that I interpret false,\n"+
		"Then were it certain you were not so bad\n"+
		"As with foul incest to abuse your soul;\n"+
		"Where now you're both a father and a son,\n"+
		"By your untimely claspings with your child,\n"+
		"Which pleasure fits an husband, not a father;\n"+
		"And she an eater of her mother's flesh,\n"+
		"By the defiling of her parent's bed;\n"+
		"And both like serpents are, who though they feed\n"+
		"On sweetest flowers, yet they poison breed.\n"+
		"Antioch, farewell! for wisdom sees, those men\n"+
		"Blush not in actions blacker than the night,\n"+
		"Will shun no course to keep them from the light.\n"+
		"One sin, I know, another doth provoke;\n"+
		"Murder's as near to lust as flame to smoke:\n"+
		"Poison and treason are the hands of sin,\n"+
		"Ay, and the targets, to put off the shame:\n"+
		"Then, lest my lie be cropp'd to keep you clear,\n"+
		"By flight I'll shun the danger which I fear.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"Re-enter ANTIOCHUS\n"+
		"ANTIOCHUS\n"+
		"He hath found the meaning, for which we mean\n"+
		"To have his head.\n"+
		"He must not live to trumpet forth my infamy,\n"+
		"Nor tell the world Antiochus doth sin\n"+
		"In such a loathed manner;\n"+
		"And therefore instantly this prince must die:\n"+
		"For by his fall my honour must keep high.\n"+
		"Who attends us there?\n"+
		"Enter THALIARD\n"+
		"THALIARD\n"+
		"Doth your highness call?\n"+
		"ANTIOCHUS\n"+
		"Thaliard,\n"+
		"You are of our chamber, and our mind partakes\n"+
		"Her private actions to your secrecy;\n"+
		"And for your faithfulness we will advance you.\n"+
		"Thaliard, behold, here's poison, and here's gold;\n"+
		"We hate the prince of Tyre, and thou must kill him:\n"+
		"It fits thee not to ask the reason why,\n"+
		"Because we bid it. Say, is it done?\n"+
		"THALIARD\n"+
		"My lord,\n"+
		"'Tis done.\n"+
		"ANTIOCHUS\n"+
		"Enough.\n"+
		"Enter a Messenger\n"+
		"Let your breath cool yourself, telling your haste.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"My lord, prince Pericles is fled.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"ANTIOCHUS\n"+
		"As thou\n"+
		"Wilt live, fly after: and like an arrow shot\n"+
		"From a well-experienced archer hits the mark\n"+
		"His eye doth level at, so thou ne'er return\n"+
		"Unless thou say 'Prince Pericles is dead.'\n"+
		"THALIARD\n"+
		"My lord,\n"+
		"If I can get him within my pistol's length,\n"+
		"I'll make him sure enough: so, farewell to your highness.\n"+
		"ANTIOCHUS\n"+
		"Thaliard, adieu!\n"+
		"Exit THALIARD\n"+
		"Till Pericles be dead,\n"+
		"My heart can lend no succor to my head.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE II. Tyre. A room in the palace.\n"+
		"Enter PERICLES\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"[To Lords without] Let none disturb us.--Why should\n"+
		"this change of thoughts,\n"+
		"The sad companion, dull-eyed melancholy,\n"+
		"Be my so used a guest as not an hour,\n"+
		"In the day's glorious walk, or peaceful night,\n"+
		"The tomb where grief should sleep, can breed me quiet?\n"+
		"Here pleasures court mine eyes, and mine eyes shun them,\n"+
		"And danger, which I fear'd, is at Antioch,\n"+
		"Whose aim seems far too short to hit me here:\n"+
		"Yet neither pleasure's art can joy my spirits,\n"+
		"Nor yet the other's distance comfort me.\n"+
		"Then it is thus: the passions of the mind,\n"+
		"That have their first conception by mis-dread,\n"+
		"Have after-nourishment and life by care;\n"+
		"And what was first but fear what might be done,\n"+
		"Grows elder now and cares it be not done.\n"+
		"And so with me: the great Antiochus,\n"+
		"'Gainst whom I am too little to contend,\n"+
		"Since he's so great can make his will his act,\n"+
		"Will think me speaking, though I swear to silence;\n"+
		"Nor boots it me to say I honour him.\n"+
		"If he suspect I may dishonour him:\n"+
		"And what may make him blush in being known,\n"+
		"He'll stop the course by which it might be known;\n"+
		"With hostile forces he'll o'erspread the land,\n"+
		"And with the ostent of war will look so huge,\n"+
		"Amazement shall drive courage from the state;\n"+
		"Our men be vanquish'd ere they do resist,\n"+
		"And subjects punish'd that ne'er thought offence:\n"+
		"Which care of them, not pity of myself,\n"+
		"Who am no more but as the tops of trees,\n"+
		"Which fence the roots they grow by and defend them,\n"+
		"Makes both my body pine and soul to languish,\n"+
		"And punish that before that he would punish.\n"+
		"Enter HELICANUS, with other Lords\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"Joy and all comfort in your sacred breast!\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"And keep your mind, till you return to us,\n"+
		"Peaceful and comfortable!\n"+
		"HELICANUS\n"+
		"Peace, peace, and give experience tongue.\n"+
		"They do abuse the king that flatter him:\n"+
		"For flattery is the bellows blows up sin;\n"+
		"The thing which is flatter'd, but a spark,\n"+
		"To which that blast gives heat and stronger glowing;\n"+
		"Whereas reproof, obedient and in order,\n"+
		"Fits kings, as they are men, for they may err.\n"+
		"When Signior Sooth here does proclaim a peace,\n"+
		"He flatters you, makes war upon your life.\n"+
		"Prince, pardon me, or strike me, if you please;\n"+
		"I cannot be much lower than my knees.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"All leave us else; but let your cares o'erlook\n"+
		"What shipping and what lading's in our haven,\n"+
		"And then return to us.\n"+
		"Exeunt Lords\n"+
		"Helicanus, thou\n"+
		"Hast moved us: what seest thou in our looks?\n"+
		"HELICANUS\n"+
		"An angry brow, dread lord.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"If there be such a dart in princes' frowns,\n"+
		"How durst thy tongue move anger to our face?\n"+
		"HELICANUS\n"+
		"How dare the plants look up to heaven, from whence\n"+
		"They have their nourishment?\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"Thou know'st I have power\n"+
		"To take thy life from thee.\n"+
		"HELICANUS\n"+
		"[Kneeling]\n"+
		"I have ground the axe myself;\n"+
		"Do you but strike the blow.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"Rise, prithee, rise.\n"+
		"Sit down: thou art no flatterer:\n"+
		"I thank thee for it; and heaven forbid\n"+
		"That kings should let their ears hear their\n"+
		"faults hid!\n"+
		"Fit counsellor and servant for a prince,\n"+
		"Who by thy wisdom makest a prince thy servant,\n"+
		"What wouldst thou have me do?\n"+
		"HELICANUS\n"+
		"To bear with patience\n"+
		"Such griefs as you yourself do lay upon yourself.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"Thou speak'st like a physician, Helicanus,\n"+
		"That minister'st a potion unto me\n"+
		"That thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself.\n"+
		"Attend me, then: I went to Antioch,\n"+
		"Where as thou know'st, against the face of death,\n"+
		"I sought the purchase of a glorious beauty.\n"+
		"From whence an issue I might propagate,\n"+
		"Are arms to princes, and bring joys to subjects.\n"+
		"Her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder;\n"+
		"The rest--hark in thine ear--as black as incest:\n"+
		"Which by my knowledge found, the sinful father\n"+
		"Seem'd not to strike, but smooth: but thou\n"+
		"know'st this,\n"+
		"'Tis time to fear when tyrants seem to kiss.\n"+
		"Such fear so grew in me, I hither fled,\n"+
		"Under the covering of a careful night,\n"+
		"Who seem'd my good protector; and, being here,\n"+
		"Bethought me what was past, what might succeed.\n"+
		"I knew him tyrannous; and tyrants' fears\n"+
		"Decrease not, but grow faster than the years:\n"+
		"And should he doubt it, as no doubt he doth,\n"+
		"That I should open to the listening air\n"+
		"How many worthy princes' bloods were shed,\n"+
		"To keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope,\n"+
		"To lop that doubt, he'll fill this land with arms,\n"+
		"And make pretence of wrong that I have done him:\n"+
		"When all, for mine, if I may call offence,\n"+
		"Must feel war's blow, who spares not innocence:\n"+
		"Which love to all, of which thyself art one,\n"+
		"Who now reprovest me for it,--\n"+
		"HELICANUS\n"+
		"Alas, sir!\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"Drew sleep out of mine eyes, blood from my cheeks,\n"+
		"Musings into my mind, with thousand doubts\n"+
		"How I might stop this tempest ere it came;\n"+
		"And finding little comfort to relieve them,\n"+
		"I thought it princely charity to grieve them.\n"+
		"HELICANUS\n"+
		"Well, my lord, since you have given me leave to speak.\n"+
		"Freely will I speak. Antiochus you fear,\n"+
		"And justly too, I think, you fear the tyrant,\n"+
		"Who either by public war or private treason\n"+
		"Will take away your life.\n"+
		"Therefore, my lord, go travel for a while,\n"+
		"Till that his rage and anger be forgot,\n"+
		"Or till the Destinies do cut his thread of life.\n"+
		"Your rule direct to any; if to me.\n"+
		"Day serves not light more faithful than I'll be.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"I do not doubt thy faith;\n"+
		"But should he wrong my liberties in my absence?\n"+
		"HELICANUS\n"+
		"We'll mingle our bloods together in the earth,\n"+
		"From whence we had our being and our birth.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"Tyre, I now look from thee then, and to Tarsus\n"+
		"Intend my travel, where I'll hear from thee;\n"+
		"And by whose letters I'll dispose myself.\n"+
		"The care I had and have of subjects' good\n"+
		"On thee I lay whose wisdom's strength can bear it.\n"+
		"I'll take thy word for faith, not ask thine oath:\n"+
		"Who shuns not to break one will sure crack both:\n"+
		"But in our orbs we'll live so round and safe,\n"+
		"That time of both this truth shall ne'er convince,\n"+
		"Thou show'dst a subject's shine, I a true prince.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. Tyre. An ante-chamber in the palace.\n"+
		"Enter THALIARD\n"+
		"THALIARD\n"+
		"So, this is Tyre, and this the court. Here must I\n"+
		"kill King Pericles; and if I do it not, I am sure to\n"+
		"be hanged at home: 'tis dangerous. Well, I perceive\n"+
		"he was a wise fellow, and had good discretion, that,\n"+
		"being bid to ask what he would of the king, desired\n"+
		"he might know none of his secrets: now do I see he\n"+
		"had some reason for't; for if a king bid a man be a\n"+
		"villain, he's bound by the indenture of his oath to\n"+
		"be one! Hush! here come the lords of Tyre.\n"+
		"Enter HELICANUS and ESCANES, with other Lords of Tyre\n"+
		"HELICANUS\n"+
		"You shall not need, my fellow peers of Tyre,\n"+
		"Further to question me of your king's departure:\n"+
		"His seal'd commission, left in trust with me,\n"+
		"Doth speak sufficiently he's gone to travel.\n"+
		"THALIARD\n"+
		"[Aside] How! the king gone!\n"+
		"HELICANUS\n"+
		"If further yet you will be satisfied,\n"+
		"Why, as it were unlicensed of your loves,\n"+
		"He would depart, I'll give some light unto you.\n"+
		"Being at Antioch--\n"+
		"THALIARD\n"+
		"[Aside] What from Antioch?\n"+
		"HELICANUS\n"+
		"Royal Antiochus--on what cause I know not--\n"+
		"Took some displeasure at him; at least he judged so:\n"+
		"And doubting lest that he had err'd or sinn'd,\n"+
		"To show his sorrow, he'ld correct himself;\n"+
		"So puts himself unto the shipman's toil,\n"+
		"With whom each minute threatens life or death.\n"+
		"THALIARD\n"+
		"[Aside] Well, I perceive\n"+
		"I shall not be hang'd now, although I would;\n"+
		"But since he's gone, the king's seas must please:\n"+
		"He 'scaped the land, to perish at the sea.\n"+
		"I'll present myself. Peace to the lords of Tyre!\n"+
		"HELICANUS\n"+
		"Lord Thaliard from Antiochus is welcome.\n"+
		"THALIARD\n"+
		"From him I come\n"+
		"With message unto princely Pericles;\n"+
		"But since my landing I have understood\n"+
		"Your lord has betook himself to unknown travels,\n"+
		"My message must return from whence it came.\n"+
		"HELICANUS\n"+
		"We have no reason to desire it,\n"+
		"Commended to our master, not to us:\n"+
		"Yet, ere you shall depart, this we desire,\n"+
		"As friends to Antioch, we may feast in Tyre.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV. Tarsus. A room in the Governor's house.\n"+
		"Enter CLEON, the governor of Tarsus, with DIONYZA, and others\n"+
		"CLEON\n"+
		"My Dionyza, shall we rest us here,\n"+
		"And by relating tales of others' griefs,\n"+
		"See if 'twill teach us to forget our own?\n"+
		"DIONYZA\n"+
		"That were to blow at fire in hope to quench it;\n"+
		"For who digs hills because they do aspire\n"+
		"Throws down one mountain to cast up a higher.\n"+
		"O my distressed lord, even such our griefs are;\n"+
		"Here they're but felt, and seen with mischief's eyes,\n"+
		"But like to groves, being topp'd, they higher rise.\n"+
		"CLEON\n"+
		"O Dionyza,\n"+
		"Who wanteth food, and will not say he wants it,\n"+
		"Or can conceal his hunger till he famish?\n"+
		"Our tongues and sorrows do sound deep\n"+
		"Our woes into the air; our eyes do weep,\n"+
		"Till tongues fetch breath that may proclaim them louder;\n"+
		"That, if heaven slumber while their creatures want,\n"+
		"They may awake their helps to comfort them.\n"+
		"I'll then discourse our woes, felt several years,\n"+
		"And wanting breath to speak help me with tears.\n"+
		"DIONYZA\n"+
		"I'll do my best, sir.\n"+
		"CLEON\n"+
		"This Tarsus, o'er which I have the government,\n"+
		"A city on whom plenty held full hand,\n"+
		"For riches strew'd herself even in the streets;\n"+
		"Whose towers bore heads so high they kiss'd the clouds,\n"+
		"And strangers ne'er beheld but wondered at;\n"+
		"Whose men and dames so jetted and adorn'd,\n"+
		"Like one another's glass to trim them by:\n"+
		"Their tables were stored full, to glad the sight,\n"+
		"And not so much to feed on as delight;\n"+
		"All poverty was scorn'd, and pride so great,\n"+
		"The name of help grew odious to repeat.\n"+
		"DIONYZA\n"+
		"O, 'tis too true.\n"+
		"CLEON\n"+
		"But see what heaven can do! By this our change,\n"+
		"These mouths, who but of late, earth, sea, and air,\n"+
		"Were all too little to content and please,\n"+
		"Although they gave their creatures in abundance,\n"+
		"As houses are defiled for want of use,\n"+
		"They are now starved for want of exercise:\n"+
		"Those palates who, not yet two summers younger,\n"+
		"Must have inventions to delight the taste,\n"+
		"Would now be glad of bread, and beg for it:\n"+
		"Those mothers who, to nousle up their babes,\n"+
		"Thought nought too curious, are ready now\n"+
		"To eat those little darlings whom they loved.\n"+
		"So sharp are hunger's teeth, that man and wife\n"+
		"Draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life:\n"+
		"Here stands a lord, and there a lady weeping;\n"+
		"Here many sink, yet those which see them fall\n"+
		"Have scarce strength left to give them burial.\n"+
		"Is not this true?\n"+
		"DIONYZA\n"+
		"Our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it.\n"+

		"O, let those cities that of plenty's cup\n"+
		"And her prosperities so largely taste,\n"+
		"With their superfluous riots, hear these tears!\n"+
		"The misery of Tarsus may be theirs.\n"+
		"Enter a Lord\n"+
		"Lord\n"+
		"Where's the lord governor?\n"+
		"CLEON\n"+
		"Here.\n"+
		"Speak out thy sorrows which thou bring'st in haste,\n"+
		"For comfort is too far for us to expect.\n"+
		"Lord\n"+
		"We have descried, upon our neighbouring shore,\n"+
		"A portly sail of ships make hitherward.\n"+
		"CLEON\n"+
		"I thought as much.\n"+
		"One sorrow never comes but brings an heir,\n"+
		"That may succeed as his inheritor;\n"+
		"And so in ours: some neighbouring nation,\n"+
		"Taking advantage of our misery,\n"+
		"Hath stuff'd these hollow vessels with their power,\n"+
		"To beat us down, the which are down already;\n"+
		"And make a conquest of unhappy me,\n"+
		"Whereas no glory's got to overcome.\n"+
		"Lord\n"+
		"That's the least fear; for, by the semblance\n"+
		"Of their white flags display'd, they bring us peace,\n"+
		"And come to us as favourers, not as foes.\n"+
		"CLEON\n"+
		"Thou speak'st like him's untutor'd to repeat:\n"+
		"Who makes the fairest show means most deceit.\n"+
		"But bring they what they will and what they can,\n"+
		"What need we fear?\n"+
		"The ground's the lowest, and we are half way there.\n"+
		"Go tell their general we attend him here,\n"+
		"To know for what he comes, and whence he comes,\n"+
		"And what he craves.\n"+
		"Lord\n"+
		"I go, my lord.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"CLEON\n"+
		"Welcome is peace, if he on peace consist;\n"+
		"If wars, we are unable to resist.\n"+
		"Enter PERICLES with Attendants\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"Lord governor, for so we hear you are,\n"+
		"Let not our ships and number of our men\n"+
		"Be like a beacon fired to amaze your eyes.\n"+
		"We have heard your miseries as far as Tyre,\n"+
		"And seen the desolation of your streets:\n"+
		"Nor come we to add sorrow to your tears,\n"+
		"But to relieve them of their heavy load;\n"+
		"And these our ships, you happily may think\n"+
		"Are like the Trojan horse was stuff'd within\n"+
		"With bloody veins, expecting overthrow,\n"+
		"Are stored with corn to make your needy bread,\n"+
		"And give them life whom hunger starved half dead.\n"+
		"All\n"+
		"The gods of Greece protect you!\n"+
		"And we'll pray for you.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"Arise, I pray you, rise:\n"+
		"We do not look for reverence, but to love,\n"+
		"And harbourage for ourself, our ships, and men.\n"+
		"CLEON\n"+
		"The which when any shall not gratify,\n"+
		"Or pay you with unthankfulness in thought,\n"+
		"Be it our wives, our children, or ourselves,\n"+
		"The curse of heaven and men succeed their evils!\n"+
		"Till when,--the which I hope shall ne'er be seen,--\n"+
		"Your grace is welcome to our town and us.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"Which welcome we'll accept; feast here awhile,\n"+
		"Until our stars that frown lend us a smile.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT II\n"+
		"Enter GOWER\n"+
		"GOWER\n"+
		"Here have you seen a mighty king\n"+
		"His child, I wis, to incest bring;\n"+
		"A better prince and benign lord,\n"+
		"That will prove awful both in deed and word.\n"+
		"Be quiet then as men should be,\n"+
		"Till he hath pass'd necessity.\n"+
		"I'll show you those in troubles reign,\n"+
		"Losing a mite, a mountain gain.\n"+
		"The good in conversation,\n"+
		"To whom I give my benison,\n"+
		"Is still at Tarsus, where each man\n"+
		"Thinks all is writ he speken can;\n"+
		"And, to remember what he does,\n"+
		"Build his statue to make him glorious:\n"+
		"But tidings to the contrary\n"+
		"Are brought your eyes; what need speak I?\n"+
		"DUMB SHOW.\n"+
		"Enter at one door PERICLES talking with CLEON; all the train with them. Enter at another door a Gentleman, with a letter to PERICLES; PERICLES shows the letter to CLEON; gives the Messenger a reward, and knights him. Exit PERICLES at one door, and CLEON at another\n"+
		"Good Helicane, that stay'd at home,\n"+
		"Not to eat honey like a drone\n"+
		"From others' labours; for though he strive\n"+
		"To killen bad, keep good alive;\n"+
		"And to fulfil his prince' desire,\n"+
		"Sends word of all that haps in Tyre:\n"+
		"How Thaliard came full bent with sin\n"+
		"And had intent to murder him;\n"+
		"And that in Tarsus was not best\n"+
		"Longer for him to make his rest.\n"+
		"He, doing so, put forth to seas,\n"+
		"Where when men been, there's seldom ease;\n"+
		"For now the wind begins to blow;\n"+
		"Thunder above and deeps below\n"+
		"Make such unquiet, that the ship\n"+
		"Should house him safe is wreck'd and split;\n"+
		"And he, good prince, having all lost,\n"+

		"All perishen of man, of pelf,\n"+
		"Ne aught escapen but himself;\n"+
		"Till fortune, tired with doing bad,\n"+
		"Threw him ashore, to give him glad:\n"+
		"And here he comes. What shall be next,\n"+
		"Pardon old Gower,--this longs the text.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE I. Pentapolis. An open place by the sea-side.\n"+
		"Enter PERICLES, wet\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"Yet cease your ire, you angry stars of heaven!\n"+
		"Wind, rain, and thunder, remember, earthly man\n"+
		"Is but a substance that must yield to you;\n"+
		"And I, as fits my nature, do obey you:\n"+
		"Alas, the sea hath cast me on the rocks,\n"+
		"Wash'd me from shore to shore, and left me breath\n"+
		"Nothing to think on but ensuing death:\n"+
		"Let it suffice the greatness of your powers\n"+
		"To have bereft a prince of all his fortunes;\n"+
		"And having thrown him from your watery grave,\n"+
		"Here to have death in peace is all he'll crave.\n"+
		"Enter three FISHERMEN\n"+
		"First Fisherman\n"+
		"What, ho, Pilch!\n"+
		"Second Fisherman\n"+
		"Ha, come and bring away the nets!\n"+
		"First Fisherman\n"+
		"What, Patch-breech, I say!\n"+
		"Third Fisherman\n"+
		"What say you, master?\n"+
		"First Fisherman\n"+
		"Look how thou stirrest now! come away, or I'll\n"+
		"fetch thee with a wanion.\n"+
		"Third Fisherman\n"+
		"Faith, master, I am thinking of the poor men that\n"+
		"were cast away before us even now.\n"+
		"First Fisherman\n"+
		"Alas, poor souls, it grieved my heart to hear what\n"+
		"pitiful cries they made to us to help them, when,\n"+
		"well-a-day, we could scarce help ourselves.\n"+
		"Third Fisherman\n"+
		"Nay, master, said not I as much when I saw the\n"+
		"porpus how he bounced and tumbled? they say\n"+
		"they're half fish, half flesh: a plague on them,\n"+
		"they ne'er come but I look to be washed. Master, I\n"+
		"marvel how the fishes live in the sea.\n"+
		"First Fisherman\n"+
		"Why, as men do a-land; the great ones eat up the\n"+
		"little ones: I can compare our rich misers to\n"+
		"nothing so fitly as to a whale; a' plays and\n"+
		"tumbles, driving the poor fry before him, and at\n"+
		"last devours them all at a mouthful: such whales\n"+
		"have I heard on o' the land, who never leave gaping\n"+
		"till they've swallowed the whole parish, church,\n"+
		"steeple, bells, and all.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"[Aside] A pretty moral.\n"+
		"Third Fisherman\n"+
		"But, master, if I had been the sexton, I would have\n"+
		"been that day in the belfry.\n"+
		"Second Fisherman\n"+
		"Why, man?\n"+
		"Third Fisherman\n"+
		"Because he should have swallowed me too: and when I\n"+
		"had been in his belly, I would have kept such a\n"+
		"jangling of the bells, that he should never have\n"+
		"left, till he cast bells, steeple, church, and\n"+
		"parish up again. But if the good King Simonides\n"+
		"were of my mind,--\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"[Aside] Simonides!\n"+
		"Third Fisherman\n"+
		"We would purge the land of these drones, that rob\n"+
		"the bee of her honey.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"[Aside] How from the finny subject of the sea\n"+
		"These fishers tell the infirmities of men;\n"+
		"And from their watery empire recollect\n"+
		"All that may men approve or men detect!\n"+
		"Peace be at your labour, honest fishermen.\n"+
		"Second Fisherman\n"+
		"Honest! good fellow, what's that? If it be a day\n"+
		"fits you, search out of the calendar, and nobody\n"+
		"look after it.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"May see the sea hath cast upon your coast.\n"+
		"Second Fisherman\n"+
		"What a drunken knave was the sea to cast thee in our\n"+
		"way!\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"A man whom both the waters and the wind,\n"+
		"In that vast tennis-court, have made the ball\n"+
		"For them to play upon, entreats you pity him:\n"+
		"He asks of you, that never used to beg.\n"+
		"First Fisherman\n"+
		"No, friend, cannot you beg? Here's them in our\n"+
		"country Greece gets more with begging than we can do\n"+
		"with working.\n"+
		"Second Fisherman\n"+
		"Canst thou catch any fishes, then?\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"I never practised it.\n"+
		"Second Fisherman\n"+
		"Nay, then thou wilt starve, sure; for here's nothing\n"+
		"to be got now-a-days, unless thou canst fish for't.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"What I have been I have forgot to know;\n"+
		"But what I am, want teaches me to think on:\n"+
		"A man throng'd up with cold: my veins are chill,\n"+
		"And have no more of life than may suffice\n"+
		"To give my tongue that heat to ask your help;\n"+
		"Which if you shall refuse, when I am dead,\n"+
		"For that I am a man, pray see me buried.\n"+
		"First Fisherman\n"+
		"Die quoth-a? Now gods forbid! I have a gown here;\n"+
		"come, put it on; keep thee warm. Now, afore me, a\n"+
		"handsome fellow! Come, thou shalt go home, and\n"+
		"we'll have flesh for holidays, fish for\n"+
		"fasting-days, and moreo'er puddings and flap-jacks,\n"+
		"and thou shalt be welcome.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"I thank you, sir.\n"+
		"Second Fisherman\n"+
		"Hark you, my friend; you said you could not beg.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"I did but crave.\n"+
		"Second Fisherman\n"+
		"But crave! Then I'll turn craver too, and so I\n"+
		"shall 'scape whipping.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"Why, are all your beggars whipped, then?\n"+
		"Second Fisherman\n"+
		"O, not all, my friend, not all; for if all your\n"+
		"beggars were whipped, I would wish no better office\n"+
		"than to be beadle. But, master, I'll go draw up the\n"+
		"net.\n"+
		"Exit with Third Fisherman\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"[Aside] How well this honest mirth becomes their labour!\n"+
		"First Fisherman\n"+
		"Hark you, sir, do you know where ye are?\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"Not well.\n"+
		"First Fisherman\n"+
		"Why, I'll tell you: this is called Pentapolis, and\n"+
		"our king the good Simonides.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"The good King Simonides, do you call him.\n"+
		"First Fisherman\n"+
		"Ay, sir; and he deserves so to be called for his\n"+
		"peaceable reign and good government.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"He is a happy king, since he gains from his subjects\n"+
		"the name of good by his government. How far is his\n"+
		"court distant from this shore?\n"+
		"First Fisherman\n"+
		"Marry, sir, half a day's journey: and I'll tell\n"+
		"you, he hath a fair daughter, and to-morrow is her\n"+
		"birth-day; and there are princes and knights come\n"+
		"from all parts of the world to just and tourney for her love.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"Were my fortunes equal to my desires, I could wish\n"+
		"to make one there.\n"+
		"First Fisherman\n"+
		"O, sir, things must be as they may; and what a man\n"+
		"cannot get, he may lawfully deal for--his wife's soul.\n"+
		"Re-enter Second and Third Fishermen, drawing up a net\n"+
		"Second Fisherman\n"+
		"Help, master, help! here's a fish hangs in the net,\n"+
		"like a poor man's right in the law; 'twill hardly\n"+
		"come out. Ha! bots on't, 'tis come at last, and\n"+
		"'tis turned to a rusty armour.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"An armour, friends! I pray you, let me see it.\n"+
		"Thanks, fortune, yet, that, after all my crosses,\n"+
		"Thou givest me somewhat to repair myself;\n"+
		"And though it was mine own, part of my heritage,\n"+
		"Which my dead father did bequeath to me.\n"+
		"With this strict charge, even as he left his life,\n"+
		"'Keep it, my Pericles; it hath been a shield\n"+
		"Twixt me and death;'--and pointed to this brace;--\n"+
		"'For that it saved me, keep it; in like necessity--\n"+
		"The which the gods protect thee from!--may\n"+
		"defend thee.'\n"+
		"It kept where I kept, I so dearly loved it;\n"+
		"Till the rough seas, that spare not any man,\n"+
		"Took it in rage, though calm'd have given't again:\n"+
		"I thank thee for't: my shipwreck now's no ill,\n"+
		"Since I have here my father's gift in's will.\n"+
		"First Fisherman\n"+
		"What mean you, sir?\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"To beg of you, kind friends, this coat of worth,\n"+
		"For it was sometime target to a king;\n"+
		"I know it by this mark. He loved me dearly,\n"+
		"And for his sake I wish the having of it;\n"+
		"And that you'ld guide me to your sovereign's court,\n"+
		"Where with it I may appear a gentleman;\n"+
		"And if that ever my low fortune's better,\n"+
		"I'll pay your bounties; till then rest your debtor.\n"+
		"First Fisherman\n"+
		"Why, wilt thou tourney for the lady?\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"I'll show the virtue I have borne in arms.\n"+
		"First Fisherman\n"+
		"Why, do 'e take it, and the gods give thee good on't!\n"+
		"Second Fisherman\n"+
		"Ay, but hark you, my friend; 'twas we that made up\n"+
		"this garment through the rough seams of the waters:\n"+
		"there are certain condolements, certain vails. I\n"+
		"hope, sir, if you thrive, you'll remember from\n"+
		"whence you had it.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"Believe 't, I will.\n"+
		"By your furtherance I am clothed in steel;\n"+
		"And, spite of all the rapture of the sea,\n"+
		"This jewel holds his building on my arm:\n"+
		"Unto thy value I will mount myself\n"+
		"Upon a courser, whose delightful steps\n"+
		"Shall make the gazer joy to see him tread.\n"+
		"Only, my friend, I yet am unprovided\n"+
		"Of a pair of bases.\n"+
		"Second Fisherman\n"+
		"We'll sure provide: thou shalt have my best gown to\n"+
		"make thee a pair; and I'll bring thee to the court myself.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"Then honour be but a goal to my will,\n"+
		"This day I'll rise, or else add ill to ill.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. The same. A public way or platform leading to the\n"+
		"lists. A pavilion by the side of it for the\n"+
		"reception of King, Princess, Lords, & c.\n"+
		"Enter SIMONIDES, THAISA, Lords, and Attendants\n"+
		"SIMONIDES\n"+
		"Are the knights ready to begin the triumph?\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"They are, my liege;\n"+
		"And stay your coming to present themselves.\n"+
		"SIMONIDES\n"+
		"Return them, we are ready; and our daughter,\n"+
		"In honour of whose birth these triumphs are,\n"+
		"Sits here, like beauty's child, whom nature gat\n"+
		"For men to see, and seeing wonder at.\n"+
		"Exit a Lord\n"+
		"THAISA\n"+
		"It pleaseth you, my royal father, to express\n"+
		"My commendations great, whose merit's less.\n"+
		"SIMONIDES\n"+
		"It's fit it should be so; for princes are\n"+
		"A model which heaven makes like to itself:\n"+
		"As jewels lose their glory if neglected,\n"+
		"So princes their renowns if not respected.\n"+
		"'Tis now your honour, daughter, to explain\n"+
		"The labour of each knight in his device.\n"+
		"THAISA\n"+
		"Which, to preserve mine honour, I'll perform.\n"+
		"Enter a Knight; he passes over, and his Squire presents his shield to the Princess\n"+
		"SIMONIDES\n"+
		"Who is the first that doth prefer himself?\n"+
		"THAISA\n"+
		"A knight of Sparta, my renowned father;\n"+
		"And the device he bears upon his shield\n"+
		"Is a black Ethiope reaching at the sun\n"+
		"The word, 'Lux tua vita mihi.'\n"+
		"SIMONIDES\n"+
		"He loves you well that holds his life of you.\n"+
		"The Second Knight passes over\n"+
		"Who is the second that presents himself?\n"+
		"THAISA\n"+
		"A prince of Macedon, my royal father;\n"+
		"And the device he bears upon his shield\n"+
		"Is an arm'd knight that's conquer'd by a lady;\n"+
		"The motto thus, in Spanish, 'Piu por dulzura que por fuerza.'\n"+
		"The Third Knight passes over\n"+
		"SIMONIDES\n"+
		"And what's the third?\n"+
		"THAISA\n"+
		"The third of Antioch;\n"+
		"And his device, a wreath of chivalry;\n"+
		"The word, 'Me pompae provexit apex.'\n"+
		"The Fourth Knight passes over\n"+
		"SIMONIDES\n"+
		"What is the fourth?\n"+
		"THAISA\n"+
		"A burning torch that's turned upside down;\n"+
		"The word, 'Quod me alit, me extinguit.'\n"+
		"SIMONIDES\n"+
		"Which shows that beauty hath his power and will,\n"+
		"Which can as well inflame as it can kill.\n"+
		"The Fifth Knight passes over\n"+
		"THAISA\n"+
		"The fifth, an hand environed with clouds,\n"+
		"Holding out gold that's by the touchstone tried;\n"+
		"The motto thus, 'Sic spectanda fides.'\n"+
		"The Sixth Knight, PERICLES, passes over\n"+
		"SIMONIDES\n"+
		"And what's\n"+
		"The sixth and last, the which the knight himself\n"+
		"With such a graceful courtesy deliver'd?\n"+
		"THAISA\n"+
		"He seems to be a stranger; but his present is\n"+
		"A wither'd branch, that's only green at top;\n"+
		"The motto, 'In hac spe vivo.'\n"+
		"SIMONIDES\n"+
		"A pretty moral;\n"+
		"From the dejected state wherein he is,\n"+
		"He hopes by you his fortunes yet may flourish.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"He had need mean better than his outward show\n"+
		"Can any way speak in his just commend;\n"+
		"For by his rusty outside he appears\n"+
		"To have practised more the whipstock than the lance.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"He well may be a stranger, for he comes\n"+
		"To an honour'd triumph strangely furnished.\n"+
		"Third Lord\n"+
		"And on set purpose let his armour rust\n"+
		"Until this day, to scour it in the dust.\n"+
		"SIMONIDES\n"+
		"Opinion's but a fool, that makes us scan\n"+
		"The outward habit by the inward man.\n"+
		"But stay, the knights are coming: we will withdraw\n"+
		"Into the gallery.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"Great shouts within and all cry 'The mean knight!'\n"+
		"SCENE III. The same. A hall of state: a banquet prepared.\n"+
		"Enter SIMONIDES, THAISA, Lords, Attendants, and Knights, from tilting\n"+
		"SIMONIDES\n"+
		"Knights,\n"+
		"To say you're welcome were superfluous.\n"+
		"To place upon the volume of your deeds,\n"+
		"As in a title-page, your worth in arms,\n"+
		"Were more than you expect, or more than's fit,\n"+
		"Since every worth in show commends itself.\n"+
		"Prepare for mirth, for mirth becomes a feast:\n"+
		"You are princes and my guests.\n"+
		"THAISA\n"+
		"But you, my knight and guest;\n"+
		"To whom this wreath of victory I give,\n"+
		"And crown you king of this day's happiness.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"'Tis more by fortune, lady, than by merit.\n"+
		"SIMONIDES\n"+
		"Call it by what you will, the day is yours;\n"+
		"And here, I hope, is none that envies it.\n"+
		"In framing an artist, art hath thus decreed,\n"+
		"To make some good, but others to exceed;\n"+
		"And you are her labour'd scholar. Come, queen o'\n"+
		"the feast,--\n"+
		"For, daughter, so you are,--here take your place:\n"+
		"Marshal the rest, as they deserve their grace.\n"+
		"KNIGHTS\n"+
		"We are honour'd much by good Simonides.\n"+
		"SIMONIDES\n"+
		"Your presence glads our days: honour we love;\n"+
		"For who hates honour hates the gods above.\n"+
		"Marshal\n"+
		"Sir, yonder is your place.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"Some other is more fit.\n"+
		"First Knight\n"+
		"Contend not, sir; for we are gentlemen\n"+
		"That neither in our hearts nor outward eyes\n"+
		"Envy the great nor do the low despise.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"You are right courteous knights.\n"+
		"SIMONIDES\n"+
		"Sit, sir, sit.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"By Jove, I wonder, that is king of thoughts,\n"+
		"These cates resist me, she but thought upon.\n"+
		"THAISA\n"+
		"By Juno, that is queen of marriage,\n"+
		"All viands that I eat do seem unsavoury.\n"+
		"Wishing him my meat. Sure, he's a gallant gentleman.\n"+
		"SIMONIDES\n"+
		"He's but a country gentleman;\n"+
		"Has done no more than other knights have done;\n"+
		"Has broken a staff or so; so let it pass.\n"+
		"THAISA\n"+
		"To me he seems like diamond to glass.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"Yon king's to me like to my father's picture,\n"+
		"Which tells me in that glory once he was;\n"+
		"Had princes sit, like stars, about his throne,\n"+
		"And he the sun, for them to reverence;\n"+
		"None that beheld him, but, like lesser lights,\n"+
		"Did vail their crowns to his supremacy:\n"+
		"Where now his son's like a glow-worm in the night,\n"+
		"The which hath fire in darkness, none in light:\n"+
		"Whereby I see that Time's the king of men,\n"+
		"He's both their parent, and he is their grave,\n"+
		"And gives them what he will, not what they crave.\n"+
		"SIMONIDES\n"+
		"What, are you merry, knights?\n"+
		"Knights\n"+
		"Who can be other in this royal presence?\n"+
		"SIMONIDES\n"+
		"Here, with a cup that's stored unto the brim,--\n"+
		"As you do love, fill to your mistress' lips,--\n"+
		"We drink this health to you.\n"+
		"KNIGHTS\n"+
		"We thank your grace.\n"+
		"SIMONIDES\n"+
		"Yet pause awhile:\n"+
		"Yon knight doth sit too melancholy,\n"+
		"As if the entertainment in our court\n"+
		"Had not a show might countervail his worth.\n"+
		"Note it not you, Thaisa?\n"+
		"THAISA\n"+
		"What is it\n"+
		"To me, my father?\n"+
		"SIMONIDES\n"+
		"O, attend, my daughter:\n"+
		"Princes in this should live like gods above,\n"+
		"Who freely give to every one that comes\n"+
		"To honour them:\n"+
		"And princes not doin g so are like to gnats,\n"+
		"Which make a sound, but kill'd are wonder'd at.\n"+
		"Therefore to make his entrance more sweet,\n"+
		"Here, say we drink this standing-bowl of wine to him.\n"+
		"THAISA\n"+
		"Alas, my father, it befits not me\n"+
		"Unto a stranger knight to be so bold:\n"+
		"He may my proffer take for an offence,\n"+
		"Since men take women's gifts for impudence.\n"+
		"SIMONIDES\n"+
		"How!\n"+
		"Do as I bid you, or you'll move me else.\n"+
		"THAISA\n"+
		"[Aside] Now, by the gods, he could not please me better.\n"+
		"SIMONIDES\n"+
		"And furthermore tell him, we desire to know of him,\n"+
		"Of whence he is, his name and parentage.\n"+
		"THAISA\n"+
		"The king my father, sir, has drunk to you.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"I thank him.\n"+
		"THAISA\n"+

		"I thank both him and you, and pledge him freely.\n"+
		"THAISA\n"+
		"And further he desires to know of you,\n"+
		"Of whence you are, your name and parentage.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"A gentleman of Tyre; my name, Pericles;\n"+
		"My education been in arts and arms;\n"+
		"Who, looking for adventures in the world,\n"+
		"Was by the rough seas reft of ships and men,\n"+
		"And after shipwreck driven upon this shore.\n"+
		"THAISA\n"+
		"He thanks your grace; names himself Pericles,\n"+
		"A gentleman of Tyre,\n"+
		"Who only by misfortune of the seas\n"+
		"Bereft of ships and men, cast on this shore.\n"+
		"SIMONIDES\n"+
		"Now, by the gods, I pity his misfortune,\n"+
		"And will awake him from his melancholy.\n"+
		"Come, gentlemen, we sit too long on trifles,\n"+
		"And waste the time, which looks for other revels.\n"+
		"Even in your armours, as you are address'd,\n"+
		"Will very well become a soldier's dance.\n"+
		"I will not have excuse, with saying this\n"+
		"Loud music is too harsh for ladies' heads,\n"+
		"Since they love men in arms as well as beds.\n"+
		"The Knights dance\n"+
		"So, this was well ask'd,'twas so well perform'd.\n"+
		"Come, sir;\n"+
		"Here is a lady that wants breathing too:\n"+
		"And I have heard, you knights of Tyre\n"+
		"Are excellent in making ladies trip;\n"+
		"And that their measures are as excellent.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"In those that practise them they are, my lord.\n"+
		"SIMONIDES\n"+
		"O, that's as much as you would be denied\n"+
		"Of your fair courtesy.\n"+
		"The Knights and Ladies dance\n"+
		"Unclasp, unclasp:\n"+
		"Thanks, gentlemen, to all; all have done well.\n"+
		"To PERICLES\n"+
		"But you the best. Pages and lights, to conduct\n"+
		"These knights unto their several lodgings!\n"+
		"To PERICLES\n"+
		"Yours, sir,\n"+
		"We have given order to be next our own.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"I am at your grace's pleasure.\n"+
		"SIMONIDES\n"+
		"Princes, it is too late to talk of love;\n"+
		"And that's the mark I know you level at:\n"+
		"Therefore each one betake him to his rest;\n"+
		"To-morrow all for speeding do their best.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV. Tyre. A room in the Governor's house.\n"+
		"Enter HELICANUS and ESCANES\n"+
		"HELICANUS\n"+
		"No, Escanes, know this of me,\n"+
		"Antiochus from incest lived not free:\n"+
		"For which, the most high gods not minding longer\n"+
		"To withhold the vengeance that they had in store,\n"+
		"Due to this heinous capital offence,\n"+
		"Even in the height and pride of all his glory,\n"+
		"When he was seated in a chariot\n"+
		"Of an inestimable value, and his daughter with him,\n"+
		"A fire from heaven came and shrivell'd up\n"+
		"Their bodies, even to loathing; for they so stunk,\n"+
		"That all those eyes adored them ere their fall\n"+
		"Scorn now their hand should give them burial.\n"+
		"ESCANES\n"+
		"'Twas very strange.\n"+
		"HELICANUS\n"+
		"And yet but justice; for though\n"+
		"This king were great, his greatness was no guard\n"+
		"To bar heaven's shaft, but sin had his reward.\n"+
		"ESCANES\n"+
		"'Tis very true.\n"+
		"Enter two or three Lords\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"See, not a man in private conference\n"+
		"Or council has respect with him but he.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"It shall no longer grieve without reproof.\n"+
		"Third Lord\n"+
		"And cursed be he that will not second it.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"Follow me, then. Lord Helicane, a word.\n"+
		"HELICANUS\n"+
		"With me? and welcome: happy day, my lords.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"Know that our griefs are risen to the top,\n"+
		"And now at length they overflow their banks.\n"+
		"HELICANUS\n"+
		"Your griefs! for what? wrong not your prince you love.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"Wrong not yourself, then, noble Helicane;\n"+
		"But if the prince do live, let us salute him,\n"+
		"Or know what ground's made happy by his breath.\n"+
		"If in the world he live, we'll seek him out;\n"+
		"If in his grave he rest, we'll find him there;\n"+
		"And be resolved he lives to govern us,\n"+
		"Or dead, give's cause to mourn his funeral,\n"+
		"And leave us to our free election.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"Whose death indeed's the strongest in our censure:\n"+
		"And knowing this kingdom is without a head,--\n"+
		"Like goodly buildings left without a roof\n"+
		"Soon fall to ruin,--your noble self,\n"+
		"That best know how to rule and how to reign,\n"+
		"We thus submit unto,--our sovereign.\n"+
		"All\n"+
		"Live, noble Helicane!\n"+
		"HELICANUS\n"+
		"For honour's cause, forbear your suffrages:\n"+
		"If that you love Prince Pericles, forbear.\n"+
		"Take I your wish, I leap into the seas,\n"+
		"Where's hourly trouble for a minute's ease.\n"+
		"A twelvemonth longer, let me entreat you to\n"+
		"Forbear the absence of your king:\n"+
		"If in which time expired, he not return,\n"+
		"I shall with aged patience bear your yoke.\n"+
		"But if I cannot win you to this love,\n"+
		"Go search like nobles, like noble subjects,\n"+
		"And in your search spend your adventurous worth;\n"+
		"Whom if you find, and win unto return,\n"+
		"You shall like diamonds sit about his crown.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"To wisdom he's a fool that will not yield;\n"+
		"And since Lord Helicane enjoineth us,\n"+
		"We with our travels will endeavour us.\n"+
		"HELICANUS\n"+
		"Then you love us, we you, and we'll clasp hands:\n"+
		"When peers thus knit, a kingdom ever stands.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE V. Pentapolis. A room in the palace.\n"+
		"Enter SIMONIDES, reading a letter, at one door: the Knights meet him\n"+
		"First Knight\n"+
		"Good morrow to the good Simonides.\n"+
		"SIMONIDES\n"+
		"Knights, from my daughter this I let you know,\n"+
		"That for this twelvemonth she'll not undertake\n"+
		"A married life.\n"+
		"Her reason to herself is only known,\n"+
		"Which yet from her by no means can I get.\n"+
		"Second Knight\n"+
		"May we not get access to her, my lord?\n"+
		"SIMONIDES\n"+
		"'Faith, by no means; she has so strictly tied\n"+
		"Her to her chamber, that 'tis impossible.\n"+
		"One twelve moons more she'll wear Diana's livery;\n"+
		"This by the eye of Cynthia hath she vow'd\n"+
		"And on her virgin honour will not break it.\n"+
		"Third Knight\n"+
		"Loath to bid farewell, we take our leaves.\n"+
		"Exeunt Knights\n"+
		"SIMONIDES\n"+
		"So,\n"+
		"They are well dispatch'd; now to my daughter's letter:\n"+
		"She tells me here, she'd wed the stranger knight,\n"+
		"Or never more to view nor day nor light.\n"+
		"'Tis well, mistress; your choice agrees with mine;\n"+
		"I like that well: nay, how absolute she's in't,\n"+
		"Not minding whether I dislike or no!\n"+
		"Well, I do commend her choice;\n"+
		"And will no longer have it be delay'd.\n"+
		"Soft! here he comes: I must dissemble it.\n"+
		"Enter PERICLES\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"All fortune to the good Simonides!\n"+
		"SIMONIDES\n"+
		"To you as much, sir! I am beholding to you\n"+
		"For your sweet music this last night: I do\n"+
		"Protest my ears were never better fed\n"+
		"With such delightful pleasing harmony.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"It is your grace's pleasure to commend;\n"+
		"Not my desert.\n"+
		"SIMONIDES\n"+
		"Sir, you are music's master.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"The worst of all her scholars, my good lord.\n"+
		"SIMONIDES\n"+
		"Let me ask you one thing:\n"+
		"What do you think of my daughter, sir?\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"A most virtuous princess.\n"+
		"SIMONIDES\n"+
		"And she is fair too, is she not?\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"As a fair day in summer, wondrous fair.\n"+
		"SIMONIDES\n"+
		"Sir, my daughter thinks very well of you;\n"+
		"Ay, so well, that you must be her master,\n"+
		"And she will be your scholar: therefore look to it.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"I am unworthy for her schoolmaster.\n"+
		"SIMONIDES\n"+
		"She thinks not so; peruse this writing else.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"[Aside] What's here?\n"+
		"A letter, that she loves the knight of Tyre!\n"+
		"'Tis the king's subtlety to have my life.\n"+
		"O, seek not to entrap me, gracious lord,\n"+
		"A stranger and distressed gentleman,\n"+
		"That never aim'd so high to love your daughter,\n"+
		"But bent all offices to honour her.\n"+
		"SIMONIDES\n"+
		"Thou hast bewitch'd my daughter, and thou art\n"+
		"A villain.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"By the gods, I have not:\n"+
		"Never did thought of mine levy offence;\n"+
		"Nor never did my actions yet commence\n"+
		"A deed might gain her love or your displeasure.\n"+
		"SIMONIDES\n"+
		"Traitor, thou liest.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"Traitor!\n"+
		"SIMONIDES\n"+
		"Ay, traitor.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"Even in his throat--unless it be the king--\n"+
		"That calls me traitor, I return the lie.\n"+
		"SIMONIDES\n"+
		"[Aside] Now, by the gods, I do applaud his courage.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"My actions are as noble as my thoughts,\n"+
		"That never relish'd of a base descent.\n"+
		"I came unto your court for honour's cause,\n"+
		"And not to be a rebel to her state;\n"+
		"And he that otherwise accounts of me,\n"+
		"This sword shall prove he's honour's enemy.\n"+
		"SIMONIDES\n"+
		"No?\n"+
		"Here comes my daughter, she can witness it.\n"+
		"Enter THAISA\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"Then, as you are as virtuous as fair,\n"+
		"Resolve your angry father, if my tongue\n"+
		"Did ere solicit, or my hand subscribe\n"+
		"To any syllable that made love to you.\n"+
		"THAISA\n"+
		"Why, sir, say if you had,\n"+
		"Who takes offence at that would make me glad?\n"+
		"SIMONIDES\n"+
		"Yea, mistress, are you so peremptory?\n"+
		"Aside\n"+
		"I am glad on't with all my heart.--\n"+
		"I'll tame you; I'll bring you in subjection.\n"+
		"Will you, not having my consent,\n"+
		"Bestow your love and your affections\n"+
		"Upon a stranger?\n"+
		"Aside\n"+
		"who, for aught I know,\n"+
		"May be, nor can I think the contrary,\n"+
		"As great in blood as I myself.--\n"+
		"Therefore hear you, mistress; either frame\n"+
		"Your will to mine,--and you, sir, hear you,\n"+
		"Either be ruled by me, or I will make you--\n"+
		"Man and wife:\n"+
		"Nay, come, your hands and lips must seal it too:\n"+
		"And being join'd, I'll thus your hopes destroy;\n"+
		"And for a further grief,--God give you joy!--\n"+
		"What, are you both pleased?\n"+
		"THAISA\n"+
		"Yes, if you love me, sir.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"Even as my life, or blood that fosters it.\n"+
		"SIMONIDES\n"+
		"What, are you both agreed?\n"+
		"BOTH\n"+
		"Yes, if it please your majesty.\n"+
		"SIMONIDES\n"+
		"It pleaseth me so well, that I will see you wed;\n"+
		"And then with what haste you can get you to bed.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT III\n"+
		"Enter GOWER\n"+
		"GOWER\n"+
		"Now sleep y-slaked hath the rout;\n"+
		"No din but snores the house about,\n"+
		"Made louder by the o'er-fed breast\n"+
		"Of this most pompous marriage-feast.\n"+
		"The cat, with eyne of burning coal,\n"+
		"Now crouches fore the mouse's hole;\n"+
		"And crickets sing at the oven's mouth,\n"+
		"E'er the blither for their drouth.\n"+
		"Hymen hath brought the bride to bed.\n"+
		"Where, by the loss of maidenhead,\n"+
		"A babe is moulded. Be attent,\n"+
		"And time that is so briefly spent\n"+
		"With your fine fancies quaintly eche:\n"+
		"What's dumb in show I'll plain with speech.\n"+
		"DUMB SHOW.\n"+
		"Enter, PERICLES and SIMONIDES at one door, with Attendants; a Messenger meets them, kneels, and gives PERICLES a letter: PERICLES shows it SIMONIDES; the Lords kneel to him. Then enter THAISA with child, with LYCHORIDA a nurse. The KING shows her the letter; she rejoices: she and PERICLES takes leave of her father, and depart with LYCHORIDA and their Attendants. Then exeunt SIMONIDES and the rest\n"+
		"By many a dern and painful perch\n"+
		"Of Pericles the careful search,\n"+
		"By the four opposing coigns\n"+
		"Which the world together joins,\n"+
		"Is made with all due diligence\n"+
		"That horse and sail and high expense\n"+
		"Can stead the quest. At last from Tyre,\n"+
		"Fame answering the most strange inquire,\n"+
		"To the court of King Simonides\n"+
		"Are letters brought, the tenor these:\n"+
		"Antiochus and his daughter dead;\n"+
		"The men of Tyrus on the head\n"+
		"Of Helicanus would set on\n"+
		"The crown of Tyre, but he will none:\n"+
		"The mutiny he there hastes t' oppress;\n"+
		"Says to 'em, if King Pericles\n"+
		"Come not home in twice six moons,\n"+
		"He, obedient to their dooms,\n"+
		"Will take the crown. The sum of this,\n"+
		"Brought hither to Pentapolis,\n"+
		"Y-ravished the regions round,\n"+
		"And every one with claps can sound,\n"+
		"'Our heir-apparent is a king!\n"+
		"Who dream'd, who thought of such a thing?'\n"+
		"Brief, he must hence depart to Tyre:\n"+
		"His queen with child makes her desire--\n"+
		"Which who shall cross?--along to go:\n"+
		"Omit we all their dole and woe:\n"+
		"Lychorida, her nurse, she takes,\n"+
		"And so to sea. Their vessel shakes\n"+
		"On Neptune's billow; half the flood\n"+
		"Hath their keel cut: but fortune's mood\n"+
		"Varies again; the grisly north\n"+
		"Disgorges such a tempest forth,\n"+
		"That, as a duck for life that dives,\n"+
		"So up and down the poor ship drives:\n"+
		"The lady shrieks, and well-a-near\n"+
		"Does fall in travail with her fear:\n"+
		"And what ensues in this fell storm\n"+
		"Shall for itself itself perform.\n"+
		"I nill relate, action may\n"+
		"Conveniently the rest convey;\n"+
		"Which might not what by me is told.\n"+
		"In your imagination hold\n"+
		"This stage the ship, upon whose deck\n"+
		"The sea-tost Pericles appears to speak.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE I:\n"+
		"Enter PERICLES, on shipboard\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"Thou god of this great vast, rebuke these surges,\n"+
		"Which wash both heaven and hell; and thou, that hast\n"+
		"Upon the winds command, bind them in brass,\n"+
		"Having call'd them from the deep! O, still\n"+
		"Thy deafening, dreadful thunders; gently quench\n"+
		"Thy nimble, sulphurous flashes! O, how, Lychorida,\n"+
		"How does my queen? Thou stormest venomously;\n"+
		"Wilt thou spit all thyself? The seaman's whistle\n"+
		"Is as a whisper in the ears of death,\n"+
		"Unheard. Lychorida!--Lucina, O\n"+
		"Divinest patroness, and midwife gentle\n"+
		"To those that cry by night, convey thy deity\n"+
		"Aboard our dancing boat; make swift the pangs\n"+
		"Of my queen's travails!\n"+
		"Enter LYCHORIDA, with an Infant\n"+
		"Now, Lychorida!\n"+
		"LYCHORIDA\n"+
		"Here is a thing too young for such a place,\n"+
		"Who, if it had conceit, would die, as I\n"+
		"Am like to do: take in your arms this piece\n"+
		"Of your dead queen.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"How, how, Lychorida!\n"+
		"LYCHORIDA\n"+
		"Patience, good sir; do not assist the storm.\n"+
		"Here's all that is left living of your queen,\n"+
		"A little daughter: for the sake of it,\n"+
		"Be manly, and take comfort.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"O you gods!\n"+
		"Why do you make us love your goodly gifts,\n"+
		"And snatch them straight away? We here below\n"+
		"Recall not what we give, and therein may\n"+
		"Use honour with you.\n"+
		"LYCHORIDA\n"+
		"Patience, good sir,\n"+
		"Even for this charge.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"Now, mild may be thy life!\n"+
		"For a more blustrous birth had never babe:\n"+
		"Quiet and gentle thy conditions! for\n"+
		"Thou art the rudeliest welcome to this world\n"+
		"That ever was prince's child. Happy what follows!\n"+
		"Thou hast as chiding a nativity\n"+
		"As fire, air, water, earth, and heaven can make,\n"+
		"To herald thee from the womb: even at the first\n"+
		"Thy loss is more than can thy portage quit,\n"+
		"With all thou canst find here. Now, the good gods\n"+
		"Throw their best eyes upon't!\n"+
		"Enter two Sailors\n"+
		"First Sailor\n"+
		"What courage, sir? God save you!\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"Courage enough: I do not fear the flaw;\n"+
		"It hath done to me the worst. Yet, for the love\n"+
		"Of this poor infant, this fresh-new sea-farer,\n"+
		"I would it would be quiet.\n"+
		"First Sailor\n"+
		"Slack the bolins there! Thou wilt not, wilt thou?\n"+
		"Blow, and split thyself.\n"+
		"Second Sailor\n"+
		"But sea-room, an the brine and cloudy billow kiss\n"+
		"the moon, I care not.\n"+
		"First Sailor\n"+
		"Sir, your queen must overboard: the sea works high,\n"+
		"the wind is loud, and will not lie till the ship be\n"+
		"cleared of the dead.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"That's your superstition.\n"+
		"First Sailor\n"+
		"Pardon us, sir; with us at sea it hath been still\n"+
		"observed: and we are strong in custom. Therefore\n"+
		"briefly yield her; for she must overboard straight.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"As you think meet. Most wretched queen!\n"+
		"LYCHORIDA\n"+
		"Here she lies, sir.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"A terrible childbed hast thou had, my dear;\n"+
		"No light, no fire: the unfriendly elements\n"+
		"Forgot thee utterly: nor have I time\n"+
		"To give thee hallow'd to thy grave, but straight\n"+
		"Must cast thee, scarcely coffin'd, in the ooze;\n"+
		"Where, for a monument upon thy bones,\n"+
		"And e'er-remaining lamps, the belching whale\n"+
		"And humming water must o'erwhelm thy corpse,\n"+
		"Lying with simple shells. O Lychorida,\n"+
		"Bid Nestor bring me spices, ink and paper,\n"+
		"My casket and my jewels; and bid Nicander\n"+
		"Bring me the satin coffer: lay the babe\n"+
		"Upon the pillow: hie thee, whiles I say\n"+
		"A priestly farewell to her: suddenly, woman.\n"+
		"Exit LYCHORIDA\n"+
		"Second Sailor\n"+
		"Sir, we have a chest beneath the hatches, caulked\n"+
		"and bitumed ready.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"I thank thee. Mariner, say what coast is this?\n"+
		"Second Sailor\n"+
		"We are near Tarsus.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"Thither, gentle mariner.\n"+
		"Alter thy course for Tyre. When canst thou reach it?\n"+
		"Second Sailor\n"+
		"By break of day, if the wind cease.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"O, make for Tarsus!\n"+
		"There will I visit Cleon, for the babe\n"+
		"Cannot hold out to Tyrus: there I'll leave it\n"+
		"At careful nursing. Go thy ways, good mariner:\n"+
		"I'll bring the body presently.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. Ephesus. A room in CERIMON's house.\n"+
		"Enter CERIMON, with a Servant, and some Persons who have been shipwrecked\n"+
		"CERIMON\n"+
		"Philemon, ho!\n"+
		"Enter PHILEMON\n"+
		"PHILEMON\n"+
		"Doth my lord call?\n"+

		"Good morrow.\n"+
		"Second Gentleman\n"+
		"Good morrow to your lordship.\n"+
		"CERIMON\n"+
		"Gentlemen,\n"+
		"Why do you stir so early?\n"+
		"First Gentleman\n"+
		"Sir,\n"+
		"Our lodgings, standing bleak upon the sea,\n"+
		"Shook as the earth did quake;\n"+
		"The very principals did seem to rend,\n"+
		"And all-to topple: pure surprise and fear\n"+
		"Made me to quit the house.\n"+
		"Second Gentleman\n"+
		"That is the cause we trouble you so early;\n"+
		"'Tis not our husbandry.\n"+
		"CERIMON\n"+
		"O, you say well.\n"+
		"First Gentleman\n"+
		"But I much marvel that your lordship, having\n"+
		"Rich tire about you, should at these early hours\n"+
		"Shake off the golden slumber of repose.\n"+
		"'Tis most strange,\n"+
		"Nature should be so conversant with pain,\n"+
		"Being thereto not compell'd.\n"+
		"CERIMON\n"+
		"I hold it ever,\n"+
		"Virtue and cunning were endowments greater\n"+
		"Than nobleness and riches: careless heirs\n"+
		"May the two latter darken and expend;\n"+
		"But immortality attends the former.\n"+
		"Making a man a god. 'Tis known, I ever\n"+
		"Have studied physic, through which secret art,\n"+
		"By turning o'er authorities, I have,\n"+
		"Together with my practise, made familiar\n"+
		"To me and to my aid the blest infusions\n"+
		"That dwell in vegetives, in metals, stones;\n"+
		"And I can speak of the disturbances\n"+
		"That nature works, and of her cures; which doth give me\n"+
		"A more content in course of true delight\n"+
		"Than to be thirsty after tottering honour,\n"+
		"Or tie my treasure up in silken bags,\n"+
		"To please the fool and death.\n"+
		"Second Gentleman\n"+
		"Your honour has through Ephesus pour'd forth\n"+
		"Your charity, and hundreds call themselves\n"+
		"Your creatures, who by you have been restored:\n"+
		"And not your knowledge, your personal pain, but even\n"+
		"Your purse, still open, hath built Lord Cerimon\n"+
		"Such strong renown as time shall ne'er decay.\n"+
		"Enter two or three Servants with a chest\n"+
		"First Servant\n"+
		"So; lift there.\n"+
		"CERIMON\n"+
		"What is that?\n"+
		"First Servant\n"+
		"Sir, even now\n"+
		"Did the sea toss upon our shore this chest:\n"+
		"'Tis of some wreck.\n"+
		"CERIMON\n"+
		"Set 't down, let's look upon't.\n"+
		"Second Gentleman\n"+
		"'Tis like a coffin, sir.\n"+
		"CERIMON\n"+
		"Whate'er it be,\n"+
		"'Tis wondrous heavy. Wrench it open straight:\n"+
		"If the sea's stomach be o'ercharged with gold,\n"+
		"'Tis a good constraint of fortune it belches upon us.\n"+
		"Second Gentleman\n"+
		"'Tis so, my lord.\n"+
		"CERIMON\n"+
		"How close 'tis caulk'd and bitumed!\n"+
		"Did the sea cast it up?\n"+
		"First Servant\n"+
		"I never saw so huge a billow, sir,\n"+
		"As toss'd it upon shore.\n"+
		"CERIMON\n"+
		"Wrench it open;\n"+
		"Soft! it smells most sweetly in my sense.\n"+
		"Second Gentleman\n"+
		"A delicate odour.\n"+
		"CERIMON\n"+
		"As ever hit my nostril. So, up with it.\n"+
		"O you most potent gods! what's here? a corse!\n"+
		"First Gentleman\n"+
		"Most strange!\n"+
		"CERIMON\n"+
		"Shrouded in cloth of state; balm'd and entreasured\n"+
		"With full bags of spices! A passport too!\n"+

		"CLEON\n"+
		"Fear not, my lord, but think\n"+
		"Your grace, that fed my country with your corn,\n"+
		"For which the people's prayers still fall upon you,\n"+
		"Must in your child be thought on. If neglection\n"+

		"Now to Marina bend your mind,\n"+
		"Whom our fast-growing scene must find\n"+
		"At Tarsus, and by Cleon train'd\n"+
		"In music, letters; who hath gain'd\n"+
		"Of education all the grace,\n"+
		"Which makes her both the heart and place\n"+
		"Of general wonder. But, alack,\n"+
		"That monster envy, oft the wrack\n"+
		"Of earned praise, Marina's life\n"+
		"Seeks to take off by treason's knife.\n"+
		"And in this kind hath our Cleon\n"+
		"One daughter, and a wench full grown,\n"+
		"Even ripe for marriage-rite; this maid\n"+
		"Hight Philoten: and it is said\n"+
		"For certain in our story, she\n"+
		"Would ever with Marina be:\n"+
		"Be't when she weaved the sleided silk\n"+
		"With fingers long, small, white as milk;\n"+
		"Or when she would with sharp needle wound\n"+
		"The cambric, which she made more sound\n"+
		"By hurting it; or when to the lute\n"+
		"She sung, and made the night-bird mute,\n"+
		"That still records with moan; or when\n"+
		"She would with rich and constant pen\n"+
		"Vail to her mistress Dian; still\n"+
		"This Philoten contends in skill\n"+
		"With absolute Marina: so\n"+
		"With the dove of Paphos might the crow\n"+
		"Vie feathers white. Marina gets\n"+
		"All praises, which are paid as debts,\n"+
		"And not as given. This so darks\n"+
		"In Philoten all graceful marks,\n"+
		"That Cleon's wife, with envy rare,\n"+
		"A present murderer does prepare\n"+
		"For good Marina, that her daughter\n"+
		"Might stand peerless by this slaughter.\n"+
		"The sooner her vile thoughts to stead,\n"+
		"Lychorida, our nurse, is dead:\n"+
		"And cursed Dionyza hath\n"+
		"The pregnant instrument of wrath\n"+
		"Prest for this blow. The unborn event\n"+
		"I do commend to your content:\n"+
		"Only I carry winged time\n"+
		"Post on the lame feet of my rhyme;\n"+
		"Which never could I so convey,\n"+
		"Unless your thoughts went on my way.\n"+
		"Dionyza does appear,\n"+
		"With Leonine, a murderer.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE I. Tarsus. An open place near the sea-shore.\n"+
		"Enter DIONYZA and LEONINE\n"+
		"DIONYZA\n"+
		"Thy oath remember; thou hast sworn to do't:\n"+
		"'Tis but a blow, which never shall be known.\n"+
		"Thou canst not do a thing in the world so soon,\n"+
		"To yield thee so much profit. Let not conscience,\n"+
		"Which is but cold, inflaming love i' thy bosom,\n"+
		"Inflame too nicely; nor let pity, which\n"+
		"Even women have cast off, melt thee, but be\n"+
		"A soldier to thy purpose.\n"+
		"LEONINE\n"+
		"I will do't; but yet she is a goodly creature.\n"+
		"DIONYZA\n"+
		"The fitter, then, the gods should have her. Here\n"+
		"she comes weeping for her only mistress' death.\n"+
		"Thou art resolved?\n"+
		"LEONINE\n"+
		"I am resolved.\n"+
		"Enter MARINA, with a basket of flowers\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"No, I will rob Tellus of her weed,\n"+
		"To strew thy green with flowers: the yellows, blues,\n"+
		"The purple violets, and marigolds,\n"+
		"Shall as a carpet hang upon thy grave,\n"+
		"While summer-days do last. Ay me! poor maid,\n"+
		"Born in a tempest, when my mother died,\n"+
		"This world to me is like a lasting storm,\n"+
		"Whirring me from my friends.\n"+
		"DIONYZA\n"+
		"How now, Marina! why do you keep alone?\n"+
		"How chance my daughter is not with you? Do not\n"+
		"Consume your blood with sorrowing: you have\n"+
		"A nurse of me. Lord, how your favour's changed\n"+
		"With this unprofitable woe!\n"+
		"Come, give me your flowers, ere the sea mar it.\n"+
		"Walk with Leonine; the air is quick there,\n"+
		"And it pierces and sharpens the stomach. Come,\n"+
		"Leonine, take her by the arm, walk with her.\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"No, I pray you;\n"+
		"I'll not bereave you of your servant.\n"+
		"DIONYZA\n"+
		"Come, come;\n"+
		"I love the king your father, and yourself,\n"+
		"With more than foreign heart. We every day\n"+
		"Expect him here: when he shall come and find\n"+
		"Our paragon to all reports thus blasted,\n"+
		"He will repent the breadth of his great voyage;\n"+
		"Blame both my lord and me, that we have taken\n"+
		"No care to your best courses. Go, I pray you,\n"+
		"Walk, and be cheerful once again; reserve\n"+
		"That excellent complexion, which did steal\n"+
		"The eyes of young and old. Care not for me\n"+
		"I can go home alone.\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"Well, I will go;\n"+
		"But yet I have no desire to it.\n"+
		"DIONYZA\n"+
		"Come, come, I know 'tis good for you.\n"+
		"Walk half an hour, Leonine, at the least:\n"+
		"Remember what I have said.\n"+
		"LEONINE\n"+
		"I warrant you, madam.\n"+
		"DIONYZA\n"+
		"I'll leave you, my sweet lady, for a while:\n"+
		"Pray, walk softly, do not heat your blood:\n"+
		"What! I must have a care of you.\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"My thanks, sweet madam.\n"+
		"Exit DIONYZA\n"+
		"Is this wind westerly that blows?\n"+
		"LEONINE\n"+
		"South-west.\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"When I was born, the wind was north.\n"+
		"LEONINE\n"+
		"Was't so?\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"My father, as nurse said, did never fear,\n"+
		"But cried 'Good seaman!' to the sailors, galling\n"+
		"His kingly hands, haling ropes;\n"+
		"And, clasping to the mast, endured a sea\n"+
		"That almost burst the deck.\n"+
		"LEONINE\n"+
		"When was this?\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"When I was born:\n"+
		"Never was waves nor wind more violent;\n"+
		"And from the ladder-tackle washes off\n"+
		"A canvas-climber. 'Ha!' says one, 'wilt out?'\n"+
		"And with a dropping industry they skip\n"+
		"From stem to stern: the boatswain whistles, and\n"+
		"The master calls, and trebles their confusion.\n"+
		"LEONINE\n"+
		"Come, say your prayers.\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"What mean you?\n"+
		"LEONINE\n"+
		"If you require a little space for prayer,\n"+
		"I grant it: pray; but be not tedious,\n"+
		"For the gods are quick of ear, and I am sworn\n"+
		"To do my work with haste.\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"Why will you kill me?\n"+
		"LEONINE\n"+
		"To satisfy my lady.\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"Why would she have me kill'd?\n"+
		"Now, as I can remember, by my troth,\n"+
		"I never did her hurt in all my life:\n"+
		"I never spake bad word, nor did ill turn\n"+
		"To any living creature: believe me, la,\n"+
		"I never kill'd a mouse, nor hurt a fly:\n"+
		"I trod upon a worm against my will,\n"+
		"But I wept for it. How have I offended,\n"+
		"Wherein my death might yield her any profit,\n"+
		"Or my life imply her any danger?\n"+
		"LEONINE\n"+
		"My commission\n"+
		"Is not to reason of the deed, but do it.\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"You will not do't for all the world, I hope.\n"+
		"You are well favour'd, and your looks foreshow\n"+
		"You have a gentle heart. I saw you lately,\n"+
		"When you caught hurt in parting two that fought:\n"+
		"Good sooth, it show'd well in you: do so now:\n"+
		"Your lady seeks my life; come you between,\n"+
		"And save poor me, the weaker.\n"+
		"LEONINE\n"+
		"I am sworn,\n"+
		"And will dispatch.\n"+
		"He seizes her\n"+
		"Enter Pirates\n"+
		"First Pirate\n"+
		"Hold, villain!\n"+
		"LEONINE runs away\n"+
		"Second Pirate\n"+
		"A prize! a prize!\n"+
		"Third Pirate\n"+
		"Half-part, mates, half-part.\n"+
		"Come, let's have her aboard suddenly.\n"+
		"Exeunt Pirates with MARINA\n"+
		"Re-enter LEONINE\n"+
		"LEONINE\n"+
		"These roguing thieves serve the great pirate Valdes;\n"+
		"And they have seized Marina. Let her go:\n"+
		"There's no hope she will return. I'll swear\n"+
		"she's dead,\n"+
		"And thrown into the sea. But I'll see further:\n"+
		"Perhaps they will but please themselves upon her,\n"+
		"Not carry her aboard. If she remain,\n"+
		"Whom they have ravish'd must by me be slain.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE II. Mytilene. A room in a brothel.\n"+
		"Enter Pandar, Bawd, and BOULT\n"+
		"Pandar\n"+
		"Boult!\n"+
		"BOULT\n"+
		"Sir?\n"+
		"Pandar\n"+
		"Search the market narrowly; Mytilene is full of\n"+
		"gallants. We lost too much money this mart by being\n"+
		"too wenchless.\n"+
		"Bawd\n"+
		"We were never so much out of creatures. We have but\n"+
		"poor three, and they can do no more than they can\n"+
		"do; and they with continual action are even as good as rotten.\n"+
		"Pandar\n"+
		"Therefore let's have fresh ones, whate'er we pay for\n"+
		"them. If there be not a conscience to be used in\n"+
		"every trade, we shall never prosper.\n"+
		"Bawd\n"+
		"Thou sayest true: 'tis not our bringing up of poor\n"+
		"bastards,--as, I think, I have brought up some eleven--\n"+
		"BOULT\n"+
		"Ay, to eleven; and brought them down again. But\n"+
		"shall I search the market?\n"+
		"Bawd\n"+
		"What else, man? The stuff we have, a strong wind\n"+
		"will blow it to pieces, they are so pitifully sodden.\n"+
		"Pandar\n"+
		"Thou sayest true; they're too unwholesome, o'\n"+
		"conscience. The poor Transylvanian is dead, that\n"+
		"lay with the little baggage.\n"+
		"BOULT\n"+
		"Ay, she quickly pooped him; she made him roast-meat\n"+
		"for worms. But I'll go search the market.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"Pandar\n"+
		"Three or four thousand chequins were as pretty a\n"+
		"proportion to live quietly, and so give over.\n"+
		"Bawd\n"+
		"Why to give over, I pray you? is it a shame to get\n"+
		"when we are old?\n"+
		"Pandar\n"+
		"O, our credit comes not in like the commodity, nor\n"+
		"the commodity wages not with the danger: therefore,\n"+
		"if in our youths we could pick up some pretty\n"+
		"estate, 'twere not amiss to keep our door hatched.\n"+
		"Besides, the sore terms we stand upon with the gods\n"+
		"will be strong with us for giving over.\n"+
		"Bawd\n"+
		"Come, other sorts offend as well as we.\n"+
		"Pandar\n"+
		"As well as we! ay, and better too; we offend worse.\n"+
		"Neither is our profession any trade; it's no\n"+
		"calling. But here comes Boult.\n"+
		"Re-enter BOULT, with the Pirates and MARINA\n"+
		"BOULT\n"+
		"[To MARINA] Come your ways. My masters, you say\n"+
		"she's a virgin?\n"+
		"First Pirate\n"+
		"O, sir, we doubt it not.\n"+
		"BOULT\n"+
		"Master, I have gone through for this piece, you see:\n"+
		"if you like her, so; if not, I have lost my earnest.\n"+
		"Bawd\n"+
		"Boult, has she any qualities?\n"+
		"BOULT\n"+
		"She has a good face, speaks well, and has excellent\n"+
		"good clothes: there's no further necessity of\n"+
		"qualities can make her be refused.\n"+
		"Bawd\n"+
		"What's her price, Boult?\n"+
		"BOULT\n"+
		"I cannot be bated one doit of a thousand pieces.\n"+
		"Pandar\n"+
		"Well, follow me, my masters, you shall have your\n"+
		"money presently. Wife, take her in; instruct her\n"+
		"what she has to do, that she may not be raw in her\n"+
		"entertainment.\n"+
		"Exeunt Pandar and Pirates\n"+
		"Bawd\n"+
		"Boult, take you the marks of her, the colour of her\n"+
		"hair, complexion, height, age, with warrant of her\n"+
		"virginity; and cry 'He that will give most shall\n"+
		"have her first.' Such a maidenhead were no cheap\n"+
		"thing, if men were as they have been. Get this done\n"+
		"as I command you.\n"+
		"BOULT\n"+
		"Performance shall follow.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"Alack that Leonine was so slack, so slow!\n"+
		"He should have struck, not spoke; or that these pirates,\n"+
		"Not enough barbarous, had not o'erboard thrown me\n"+
		"For to seek my mother!\n"+
		"Bawd\n"+
		"Why lament you, pretty one?\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"That I am pretty.\n"+
		"Bawd\n"+
		"Come, the gods have done their part in you.\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"I accuse them not.\n"+
		"Bawd\n"+
		"You are light into my hands, where you are like to live.\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"The more my fault\n"+
		"To scape his hands where I was like to die.\n"+
		"Bawd\n"+
		"Ay, and you shall live in pleasure.\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"No.\n"+
		"Bawd\n"+
		"Yes, indeed shall you, and taste gentlemen of all\n"+
		"fashions: you shall fare well; you shall have the\n"+
		"difference of all complexions. What! do you stop your ears?\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"Are you a woman?\n"+
		"Bawd\n"+
		"What would you have me be, an I be not a woman?\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"An honest woman, or not a woman.\n"+
		"Bawd\n"+
		"Marry, whip thee, gosling: I think I shall have\n"+
		"something to do with you. Come, you're a young\n"+
		"foolish sapling, and must be bowed as I would have\n"+
		"you.\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"The gods defend me!\n"+
		"Bawd\n"+
		"If it please the gods to defend you by men, then men\n"+
		"must comfort you, men must feed you, men must stir\n"+
		"you up. Boult's returned.\n"+
		"Re-enter BOULT\n"+
		"Now, sir, hast thou cried her through the market?\n"+
		"BOULT\n"+
		"I have cried her almost to the number of her hairs;\n"+
		"I have drawn her picture with my voice.\n"+
		"Bawd\n"+
		"And I prithee tell me, how dost thou find the\n"+
		"inclination of the people, especially of the younger sort?\n"+
		"BOULT\n"+
		"'Faith, they listened to me as they would have\n"+
		"hearkened to their father's testament. There was a\n"+
		"Spaniard's mouth so watered, that he went to bed to\n"+
		"her very description.\n"+
		"Bawd\n"+
		"We shall have him here to-morrow with his best ruff on.\n"+
		"BOULT\n"+
		"To-night, to-night. But, mistress, do you know the\n"+
		"French knight that cowers i' the hams?\n"+
		"Bawd\n"+
		"Who, Monsieur Veroles?\n"+
		"BOULT\n"+
		"Ay, he: he offered to cut a caper at the\n"+
		"proclamation; but he made a groan at it, and swore\n"+
		"he would see her to-morrow.\n"+
		"Bawd\n"+
		"Well, well; as for him, he brought his disease\n"+
		"hither: here he does but repair it. I know he will\n"+
		"come in our shadow, to scatter his crowns in the\n"+
		"sun.\n"+
		"BOULT\n"+
		"Well, if we had of every nation a traveller, we\n"+
		"should lodge them with this sign.\n"+
		"Bawd\n"+
		"[To MARINA] Pray you, come hither awhile. You\n"+
		"have fortunes coming upon you. Mark me: you must\n"+
		"seem to do that fearfully which you commit\n"+
		"willingly, despise profit where you have most gain.\n"+
		"To weep that you live as ye do makes pity in your\n"+
		"lovers: seldom but that pity begets you a good\n"+
		"opinion, and that opinion a mere profit.\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"I understand you not.\n"+
		"BOULT\n"+
		"O, take her home, mistress, take her home: these\n"+
		"blushes of hers must be quenched with some present practise.\n"+
		"Bawd\n"+
		"Thou sayest true, i' faith, so they must; for your\n"+

		"with warrant.\n"+
		"BOULT\n"+
		"'Faith, some do, and some do not. But, mistress, if\n"+

		"Bawd\n"+
		"Boult, spend thou that in the town: report what a\n"+

		"When nature flamed this piece, she meant thee a good\n"+

		"BOULT\n"+
		"I warrant you, mistress, thunder shall not so awake\n"+
		"the beds of eels as my giving out her beauty stir up\n"+

		"SCENE III. Tarsus. A room in CLEON's house.\n"+
		"Enter CLEON and DIONYZA\n"+
		"DIONYZA\n"+
		"Why, are you foolish? Can it be undone?\n"+
		"CLEON\n"+
		"O Dionyza, such a piece of slaughter\n"+
		"The sun and moon ne'er look'd upon!\n"+
		"DIONYZA\n"+
		"I think\n"+
		"You'll turn a child again.\n"+
		"CLEON\n"+
		"Were I chief lord of all this spacious world,\n"+
		"I'ld give it to undo the deed. O lady,\n"+
		"Much less in blood than virtue, yet a princess\n"+
		"To equal any single crown o' the earth\n"+
		"I' the justice of compare! O villain Leonine!\n"+
		"Whom thou hast poison'd too:\n"+
		"If thou hadst drunk to him, 't had been a kindness\n"+
		"Becoming well thy fact: what canst thou say\n"+
		"When noble Pericles shall demand his child?\n"+
		"DIONYZA\n"+
		"That she is dead. Nurses are not the fates,\n"+
		"To foster it, nor ever to preserve.\n"+
		"She died at night; I'll say so. Who can cross it?\n"+
		"Unless you play the pious innocent,\n"+
		"And for an honest attribute cry out\n"+
		"'She died by foul play.'\n"+
		"CLEON\n"+
		"O, go to. Well, well,\n"+
		"Of all the faults beneath the heavens, the gods\n"+
		"Do like this worst.\n"+
		"DIONYZA\n"+
		"Be one of those that think\n"+
		"The petty wrens of Tarsus will fly hence,\n"+
		"And open this to Pericles. I do shame\n"+
		"To think of what a noble strain you are,\n"+
		"And of how coward a spirit.\n"+
		"CLEON\n"+
		"To such proceeding\n"+
		"Who ever but his approbation added,\n"+
		"Though not his prime consent, he did not flow\n"+
		"From honourable sources.\n"+
		"DIONYZA\n"+
		"Be it so, then:\n"+
		"Yet none does know, but you, how she came dead,\n"+
		"Nor none can know, Leonine being gone.\n"+
		"She did disdain my child, and stood between\n"+
		"Her and her fortunes: none would look on her,\n"+
		"But cast their gazes on Marina's face;\n"+
		"Whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin\n"+
		"Not worth the time of day. It pierced me through;\n"+
		"And though you call my course unnatural,\n"+
		"You not your child well loving, yet I find\n"+
		"It greets me as an enterprise of kindness\n"+
		"Perform'd to your sole daughter.\n"+
		"CLEON\n"+
		"Heavens forgive it!\n"+
		"DIONYZA\n"+
		"And as for Pericles,\n"+
		"What should he say? We wept after her hearse,\n"+
		"And yet we mourn: her monument\n"+
		"Is almost finish'd, and her epitaphs\n"+
		"In glittering golden characters express\n"+
		"A general praise to her, and care in us\n"+
		"At whose expense 'tis done.\n"+
		"CLEON\n"+
		"Thou art like the harpy,\n"+
		"Which, to betray, dost, with thine angel's face,\n"+
		"Seize with thine eagle's talons.\n"+
		"DIONYZA\n"+
		"You are like one that superstitiously\n"+
		"Doth swear to the gods that winter kills the flies:\n"+
		"But yet I know you'll do as I advise.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV:\n"+
		"Enter GOWER, before the monument of MARINA at Tarsus\n"+
		"GOWER\n"+
		"Thus time we waste, and longest leagues make short;\n"+
		"Sail seas in cockles, have an wish but for't;\n"+
		"Making, to take your imagination,\n"+
		"From bourn to bourn, region to region.\n"+
		"By you being pardon'd, we commit no crime\n"+
		"To use one language in each several clime\n"+
		"Where our scenes seem to live. I do beseech you\n"+
		"To learn of me, who stand i' the gaps to teach you,\n"+
		"The stages of our story. Pericles\n"+
		"Is now again thwarting the wayward seas,\n"+
		"Attended on by many a lord and knight.\n"+
		"To see his daughter, all his life's delight.\n"+
		"Old Escanes, whom Helicanus late\n"+
		"Advanced in time to great and high estate,\n"+
		"Is left to govern. Bear you it in mind,\n"+
		"Old Helicanus goes along behind.\n"+
		"Well-sailing ships and bounteous winds have brought\n"+
		"This king to Tarsus,--think his pilot thought;\n"+
		"So with his steerage shall your thoughts grow on,--\n"+
		"To fetch his daughter home, who first is gone.\n"+
		"Like motes and shadows see them move awhile;\n"+
		"Your ears unto your eyes I'll reconcile.\n"+
		"DUMB SHOW.\n"+
		"Enter PERICLES, at one door, with all his train; CLEON and DIONYZA, at the other. CLEON shows PERICLES the tomb; whereat PERICLES makes lamentation, puts on sackcloth, and in a mighty passion departs. Then exeunt CLEON and DIONYZA\n"+
		"See how belief may suffer by foul show!\n"+
		"This borrow'd passion stands for true old woe;\n"+
		"And Pericles, in sorrow all devour'd,\n"+
		"With sighs shot through, and biggest tears\n"+
		"o'ershower'd,\n"+
		"Leaves Tarsus and again embarks. He swears\n"+
		"Never to wash his face, nor cut his hairs:\n"+
		"He puts on sackcloth, and to sea. He bears\n"+
		"A tempest, which his mortal vessel tears,\n"+
		"And yet he rides it out. Now please you wit.\n"+
		"The epitaph is for Marina writ\n"+
		"By wicked Dionyza.\n"+
		"Reads the inscription on MARINA's monument\n"+
		"'The fairest, sweet'st, and best lies here,\n"+
		"Who wither'd in her spring of year.\n"+
		"She was of Tyrus the king's daughter,\n"+
		"On whom foul death hath made this slaughter;\n"+
		"Marina was she call'd; and at her birth,\n"+
		"Thetis, being proud, swallow'd some part o' the earth:\n"+
		"Therefore the earth, fearing to be o'erflow'd,\n"+
		"Hath Thetis' birth-child on the heavens bestow'd:\n"+
		"Wherefore she does, and swears she'll never stint,\n"+
		"Make raging battery upon shores of flint.'\n"+
		"No visor does become black villany\n"+
		"So well as soft and tender flattery.\n"+
		"Let Pericles believe his daughter's dead,\n"+
		"And bear his courses to be ordered\n"+
		"By Lady Fortune; while our scene must play\n"+
		"His daughter's woe and heavy well-a-day\n"+
		"In her unholy service. Patience, then,\n"+
		"And think you now are all in Mytilene.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE V. Mytilene. A street before the brothel.\n"+
		"Enter, from the brothel, two Gentlemen\n"+
		"First Gentleman\n"+
		"Did you ever hear the like?\n"+
		"Second Gentleman\n"+
		"No, nor never shall do in such a place as this, she\n"+
		"being once gone.\n"+
		"First Gentleman\n"+
		"But to have divinity preached there! did you ever\n"+
		"dream of such a thing?\n"+
		"Second Gentleman\n"+
		"No, no. Come, I am for no more bawdy-houses:\n"+
		"shall's go hear the vestals sing?\n"+
		"First Gentleman\n"+
		"I'll do any thing now that is virtuous; but I\n"+
		"am out of the road of rutting for ever.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE VI. The same. A room in the brothel.\n"+
		"Enter Pandar, Bawd, and BOULT\n"+
		"Pandar\n"+
		"Well, I had rather than twice the worth of her she\n"+
		"had ne'er come here.\n"+
		"Bawd\n"+
		"Fie, fie upon her! she's able to freeze the god\n"+
		"Priapus, and undo a whole generation. We must\n"+
		"either get her ravished, or be rid of her. When she\n"+
		"should do for clients her fitment, and do me the\n"+
		"kindness of our profession, she has me her quirks,\n"+
		"her reasons, her master reasons, her prayers, her\n"+
		"knees; that she would make a puritan of the devil,\n"+
		"if he should cheapen a kiss of her.\n"+
		"BOULT\n"+
		"'Faith, I must ravish her, or she'll disfurnish us\n"+
		"of all our cavaliers, and make our swearers priests.\n"+
		"Pandar\n"+
		"Now, the pox upon her green-sickness for me!\n"+
		"Bawd\n"+
		"'Faith, there's no way to be rid on't but by the\n"+
		"way to the pox. Here comes the Lord Lysimachus disguised.\n"+
		"BOULT\n"+
		"We should have both lord and lown, if the peevish\n"+
		"baggage would but give way to customers.\n"+
		"Enter LYSIMACHUS\n"+
		"LYSIMACHUS\n"+
		"How now! How a dozen of virginities?\n"+
		"Bawd\n"+
		"Now, the gods to-bless your honour!\n"+
		"BOULT\n"+
		"I am glad to see your honour in good health.\n"+
		"LYSIMACHUS\n"+
		"You may so; 'tis the better for you that your\n"+
		"resorters stand upon sound legs. How now!\n"+
		"wholesome iniquity have you that a man may deal\n"+
		"withal, and defy the surgeon?\n"+
		"Bawd\n"+
		"We have here one, sir, if she would--but there never\n"+
		"came her like in Mytilene.\n"+
		"LYSIMACHUS\n"+
		"If she'ld do the deed of darkness, thou wouldst say.\n"+
		"Bawd\n"+
		"Your honour knows what 'tis to say well enough.\n"+
		"LYSIMACHUS\n"+
		"Well, call forth, call forth.\n"+
		"BOULT\n"+
		"For flesh and blood, sir, white and red, you shall\n"+
		"see a rose; and she were a rose indeed, if she had but--\n"+
		"LYSIMACHUS\n"+
		"What, prithee?\n"+
		"BOULT\n"+
		"O, sir, I can be modest.\n"+
		"LYSIMACHUS\n"+
		"That dignifies the renown of a bawd, no less than it\n"+
		"gives a good report to a number to be chaste.\n"+
		"Exit BOULT\n"+
		"Bawd\n"+
		"Here comes that which grows to the stalk; never\n"+
		"plucked yet, I can assure you.\n"+
		"Re-enter BOULT with MARINA\n"+
		"Is she not a fair creature?\n"+
		"LYSIMACHUS\n"+
		"'Faith, she would serve after a long voyage at sea.\n"+
		"Well, there's for you: leave us.\n"+
		"Bawd\n"+
		"I beseech your honour, give me leave: a word, and\n"+
		"I'll have done presently.\n"+
		"LYSIMACHUS\n"+
		"I beseech you, do.\n"+
		"Bawd\n"+
		"[To MARINA] First, I would have you note, this is\n"+
		"an honourable man.\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"I desire to find him so, that I may worthily note him.\n"+
		"Bawd\n"+
		"Next, he's the governor of this country, and a man\n"+
		"whom I am bound to.\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"If he govern the country, you are bound to him\n"+
		"indeed; but how honourable he is in that, I know not.\n"+
		"Bawd\n"+
		"Pray you, without any more virginal fencing, will\n"+
		"you use him kindly? He will line your apron with gold.\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"What he will do graciously, I will thankfully receive.\n"+
		"LYSIMACHUS\n"+
		"Ha' you done?\n"+
		"Bawd\n"+
		"My lord, she's not paced yet: you must take some\n"+
		"pains to work her to your manage. Come, we will\n"+
		"leave his honour and her together. Go thy ways.\n"+
		"Exeunt Bawd, Pandar, and BOULT\n"+
		"LYSIMACHUS\n"+
		"Now, pretty one, how long have you been at this trade?\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"What trade, sir?\n"+
		"LYSIMACHUS\n"+
		"Why, I cannot name't but I shall offend.\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"I cannot be offended with my trade. Please you to name it.\n"+
		"LYSIMACHUS\n"+
		"How long have you been of this profession?\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"E'er since I can remember.\n"+
		"LYSIMACHUS\n"+
		"Did you go to 't so young? Were you a gamester at\n"+
		"five or at seven?\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"Earlier too, sir, if now I be one.\n"+
		"LYSIMACHUS\n"+
		"Why, the house you dwell in proclaims you to be a\n"+
		"creature of sale.\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"Do you know this house to be a place of such resort,\n"+
		"and will come into 't? I hear say you are of\n"+
		"honourable parts, and are the governor of this place.\n"+
		"LYSIMACHUS\n"+
		"Why, hath your principal made known unto you who I am?\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"Who is my principal?\n"+
		"LYSIMACHUS\n"+
		"Why, your herb-woman; she that sets seeds and roots\n"+
		"of shame and iniquity. O, you have heard something\n"+
		"of my power, and so stand aloof for more serious\n"+
		"wooing. But I protest to thee, pretty one, my\n"+
		"authority shall not see thee, or else look friendly\n"+
		"upon thee. Come, bring me to some private place:\n"+
		"come, come.\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"If you were born to honour, show it now;\n"+
		"If put upon you, make the judgment good\n"+
		"That thought you worthy of it.\n"+
		"LYSIMACHUS\n"+
		"How's this? how's this? Some more; be sage.\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"For me,\n"+
		"That am a maid, though most ungentle fortune\n"+
		"Have placed me in this sty, where, since I came,\n"+
		"Diseases have been sold dearer than physic,\n"+
		"O, that the gods\n"+
		"Would set me free from this unhallow'd place,\n"+
		"Though they did change me to the meanest bird\n"+
		"That flies i' the purer air!\n"+
		"LYSIMACHUS\n"+
		"I did not think\n"+
		"Thou couldst have spoke so well; ne'er dream'd thou couldst.\n"+
		"Had I brought hither a corrupted mind,\n"+
		"Thy speech had alter'd it. Hold, here's gold for thee:\n"+
		"Persever in that clear way thou goest,\n"+
		"And the gods strengthen thee!\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"The good gods preserve you!\n"+
		"LYSIMACHUS\n"+
		"For me, be you thoughten\n"+
		"That I came with no ill intent; for to me\n"+
		"The very doors and windows savour vilely.\n"+
		"Fare thee well. Thou art a piece of virtue, and\n"+
		"I doubt not but thy training hath been noble.\n"+
		"Hold, here's more gold for thee.\n"+
		"A curse upon him, die he like a thief,\n"+
		"That robs thee of thy goodness! If thou dost\n"+
		"Hear from me, it shall be for thy good.\n"+
		"Re-enter BOULT\n"+
		"BOULT\n"+
		"I beseech your honour, one piece for me.\n"+
		"LYSIMACHUS\n"+
		"Avaunt, thou damned door-keeper!\n"+
		"Your house, but for this virgin that doth prop it,\n"+
		"Would sink and overwhelm you. Away!\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"BOULT\n"+
		"How's this? We must take another course with you.\n"+
		"If your peevish chastity, which is not worth a\n"+
		"breakfast in the cheapest country under the cope,\n"+
		"shall undo a whole household, let me be gelded like\n"+
		"a spaniel. Come your ways.\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"Whither would you have me?\n"+
		"BOULT\n"+
		"I must have your maidenhead taken off, or the common\n"+
		"hangman shall execute it. Come your ways. We'll\n"+
		"have no more gentlemen driven away. Come your ways, I say.\n"+
		"Re-enter Bawd\n"+
		"Bawd\n"+
		"How now! what's the matter?\n"+
		"BOULT\n"+
		"Worse and worse, mistress; she has here spoken holy\n"+
		"words to the Lord Lysimachus.\n"+
		"Bawd\n"+
		"O abominable!\n"+
		"BOULT\n"+
		"She makes our profession as it were to stink afore\n"+
		"the face of the gods.\n"+
		"Bawd\n"+
		"Marry, hang her up for ever!\n"+
		"BOULT\n"+
		"The nobleman would have dealt with her like a\n"+
		"nobleman, and she sent him away as cold as a\n"+
		"snowball; saying his prayers too.\n"+
		"Bawd\n"+
		"Boult, take her away; use her at thy pleasure:\n"+
		"crack the glass of her virginity, and make the rest malleable.\n"+
		"BOULT\n"+
		"An if she were a thornier piece of ground than she\n"+
		"is, she shall be ploughed.\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"Hark, hark, you gods!\n"+
		"Bawd\n"+
		"She conjures: away with her! Would she had never\n"+
		"come within my doors! Marry, hang you! She's born\n"+
		"to undo us. Will you not go the way of women-kind?\n"+
		"Marry, come up, my dish of chastity with rosemary and bays!\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"BOULT\n"+
		"Come, mistress; come your ways with me.\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"Whither wilt thou have me?\n"+
		"BOULT\n"+
		"To take from you the jewel you hold so dear.\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"Prithee, tell me one thing first.\n"+
		"BOULT\n"+
		"Come now, your one thing.\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"What canst thou wish thine enemy to be?\n"+
		"BOULT\n"+
		"Why, I could wish him to be my master, or rather, my mistress.\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"Neither of these are so bad as thou art,\n"+
		"Since they do better thee in their command.\n"+
		"Thou hold'st a place, for which the pained'st fiend\n"+
		"Of hell would not in reputation change:\n"+
		"Thou art the damned doorkeeper to every\n"+
		"Coistrel that comes inquiring for his Tib;\n"+
		"To the choleric fisting of every rogue\n"+
		"Thy ear is liable; thy food is such\n"+
		"As hath been belch'd on by infected lungs.\n"+
		"BOULT\n"+
		"What would you have me do? go to the wars, would\n"+
		"you? where a man may serve seven years for the loss\n"+
		"of a leg, and have not money enough in the end to\n"+
		"buy him a wooden one?\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"Do any thing but this thou doest. Empty\n"+
		"OLD receptacles, or common shores, of filth;\n"+
		"Serve by indenture to the common hangman:\n"+
		"Any of these ways are yet better than this;\n"+
		"For what thou professest, a baboon, could he speak,\n"+
		"Would own a name too dear. O, that the gods\n"+
		"Would safely deliver me from this place!\n"+
		"Here, here's gold for thee.\n"+
		"If that thy master would gain by thee,\n"+
		"Proclaim that I can sing, weave, sew, and dance,\n"+
		"With other virtues, which I'll keep from boast:\n"+
		"And I will undertake all these to teach.\n"+
		"I doubt not but this populous city will\n"+
		"Yield many scholars.\n"+
		"BOULT\n"+
		"But can you teach all this you speak of?\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"Prove that I cannot, take me home again,\n"+

		"BOULT\n"+
		"Well, I will see what I can do for thee: if I can\n"+

		"But amongst honest women.\n"+
		"BOULT\n"+
		"'Faith, my acquaintance lies little amongst them.\n"+

		"Marina thus the brothel 'scapes, and chances\n"+

		"Nature's own shape, of bud, bird, branch, or berry,\n"+
		"That even her art sisters the natural roses;\n"+
		"Her inkle, silk, twin with the rubied cherry:\n"+

		"Where we left him, on the sea. We there him lost;\n"+
		"Whence, driven before the winds, he is arrived\n"+
		"Here where his daughter dwells; and on this coast\n"+

		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE I. On board PERICLES' ship, off Mytilene. A close\n"+
		"pavilion on deck, with a curtain before it; PERICLES\n"+
		"within it, reclined on a couch. A barge lying\n"+
		"beside the Tyrian vessel.\n"+
		"Enter two Sailors, one belonging to the Tyrian vessel, the other to the barge; to them HELICANUS\n"+
		"Tyrian Sailor\n"+
		"[To the Sailor of Mytilene] Where is lord Helicanus?\n"+

		"Wherein we are not destitute for want,\n"+
		"But weary for the staleness.\n"+
		"LYSIMACHUS\n"+
		"O, sir, a courtesy\n"+
		"Which if we should deny, the most just gods\n"+
		"For every graff would send a caterpillar,\n"+
		"And so afflict our province. Yet once more\n"+
		"Let me entreat to know at large the cause\n"+
		"Of your king's sorrow.\n"+
		"HELICANUS\n"+
		"Sit, sir, I will recount it to you:\n"+
		"But, see, I am prevented.\n"+
		"Re-enter, from the barge, Lord, with MARINA, and a young Lady\n"+
		"LYSIMACHUS\n"+
		"O, here is\n"+
		"The lady that I sent for. Welcome, fair one!\n"+
		"Is't not a goodly presence?\n"+
		"HELICANUS\n"+
		"She's a gallant lady.\n"+
		"LYSIMACHUS\n"+
		"She's such a one, that, were I well assured\n"+
		"Came of a gentle kind and noble stock,\n"+
		"I'ld wish no better choice, and think me rarely wed.\n"+
		"Fair one, all goodness that consists in bounty\n"+
		"Expect even here, where is a kingly patient:\n"+
		"If that thy prosperous and artificial feat\n"+
		"Can draw him but to answer thee in aught,\n"+
		"Thy sacred physic shall receive such pay\n"+
		"As thy desires can wish.\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"Sir, I will use\n"+
		"My utmost skill in his recovery, Provided\n"+
		"That none but I and my companion maid\n"+
		"Be suffer'd to come near him.\n"+
		"LYSIMACHUS\n"+
		"Come, let us leave her;\n"+
		"And the gods make her prosperous!\n"+
		"MARINA sings\n"+
		"LYSIMACHUS\n"+
		"Mark'd he your music?\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"No, nor look'd on us.\n"+
		"LYSIMACHUS\n"+
		"See, she will speak to him.\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"Hail, sir! my lord, lend ear.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"Hum, ha!\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"I am a maid,\n"+
		"My lord, that ne'er before invited eyes,\n"+
		"But have been gazed on like a comet: she speaks,\n"+
		"My lord, that, may be, hath endured a grief\n"+
		"Might equal yours, if both were justly weigh'd.\n"+
		"Though wayward fortune did malign my state,\n"+
		"My derivation was from ancestors\n"+
		"Who stood equivalent with mighty kings:\n"+
		"But time hath rooted out my parentage,\n"+
		"And to the world and awkward casualties\n"+
		"Bound me in servitude.\n"+
		"Aside\n"+
		"I will desist;\n"+
		"But there is something glows upon my cheek,\n"+
		"And whispers in mine ear, 'Go not till he speak.'\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"My fortunes--parentage--good parentage--\n"+
		"To equal mine!--was it not thus? what say you?\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"I said, my lord, if you did know my parentage,\n"+
		"You would not do me violence.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"I do think so. Pray you, turn your eyes upon me.\n"+
		"You are like something that--What country-woman?\n"+
		"Here of these shores?\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"No, nor of any shores:\n"+
		"Yet I was mortally brought forth, and am\n"+
		"No other than I appear.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"I am great with woe, and shall deliver weeping.\n"+
		"My dearest wife was like this maid, and such a one\n"+
		"My daughter might have been: my queen's square brows;\n"+
		"Her stature to an inch; as wand-like straight;\n"+
		"As silver-voiced; her eyes as jewel-like\n"+
		"And cased as richly; in pace another Juno;\n"+
		"Who starves the ears she feeds, and makes them hungry,\n"+
		"The more she gives them speech. Where do you live?\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"Where I am but a stranger: from the deck\n"+
		"You may discern the place.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"Where were you bred?\n"+
		"And how achieved you these endowments, which\n"+
		"You make more rich to owe?\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"If I should tell my history, it would seem\n"+
		"Like lies disdain'd in the reporting.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"Prithee, speak:\n"+
		"Falseness cannot come from thee; for thou look'st\n"+
		"Modest as Justice, and thou seem'st a palace\n"+
		"For the crown'd Truth to dwell in: I will\n"+
		"believe thee,\n"+
		"And make my senses credit thy relation\n"+
		"To points that seem impossible; for thou look'st\n"+
		"Like one I loved indeed. What were thy friends?\n"+
		"Didst thou not say, when I did push thee back--\n"+
		"Which was when I perceived thee--that thou camest\n"+
		"From good descending?\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"So indeed I did.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"Report thy parentage. I think thou said'st\n"+
		"Thou hadst been toss'd from wrong to injury,\n"+
		"And that thou thought'st thy griefs might equal mine,\n"+
		"If both were open'd.\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"Some such thing\n"+
		"I said, and said no more but what my thoughts\n"+
		"Did warrant me was likely.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"Tell thy story;\n"+
		"If thine consider'd prove the thousandth part\n"+
		"Of my endurance, thou art a man, and I\n"+
		"Have suffer'd like a girl: yet thou dost look\n"+
		"Like Patience gazing on kings' graves, and smiling\n"+
		"Extremity out of act. What were thy friends?\n"+
		"How lost thou them? Thy name, my most kind virgin?\n"+
		"Recount, I do beseech thee: come, sit by me.\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"My name is Marina.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"O, I am mock'd,\n"+
		"And thou by some incensed god sent hither\n"+
		"To make the world to laugh at me.\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"Patience, good sir,\n"+
		"Or here I'll cease.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"Nay, I'll be patient.\n"+
		"Thou little know'st how thou dost startle me,\n"+
		"To call thyself Marina.\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"The name\n"+
		"Was given me by one that had some power,\n"+
		"My father, and a king.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"How! a king's daughter?\n"+
		"And call'd Marina?\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"You said you would believe me;\n"+
		"But, not to be a troubler of your peace,\n"+
		"I will end here.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"But are you flesh and blood?\n"+
		"Have you a working pulse? and are no fairy?\n"+
		"Motion! Well; speak on. Where were you born?\n"+
		"And wherefore call'd Marina?\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"Call'd Marina\n"+
		"For I was born at sea.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"At sea! what mother?\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"My mother was the daughter of a king;\n"+
		"Who died the minute I was born,\n"+
		"As my good nurse Lychorida hath oft\n"+
		"Deliver'd weeping.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"O, stop there a little!\n"+
		"Aside\n"+
		"This is the rarest dream that e'er dull sleep\n"+
		"Did mock sad fools withal: this cannot be:\n"+
		"My daughter's buried. Well: where were you bred?\n"+
		"I'll hear you more, to the bottom of your story,\n"+
		"And never interrupt you.\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"You scorn: believe me, 'twere best I did give o'er.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"I will believe you by the syllable\n"+
		"Of what you shall deliver. Yet, give me leave:\n"+
		"How came you in these parts? where were you bred?\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"The king my father did in Tarsus leave me;\n"+
		"Till cruel Cleon, with his wicked wife,\n"+
		"Did seek to murder me: and having woo'd\n"+
		"A villain to attempt it, who having drawn to do't,\n"+
		"A crew of pirates came and rescued me;\n"+
		"Brought me to Mytilene. But, good sir,\n"+
		"Whither will you have me? Why do you weep?\n"+
		"It may be,\n"+
		"You think me an impostor: no, good faith;\n"+
		"I am the daughter to King Pericles,\n"+
		"If good King Pericles be.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"Ho, Helicanus!\n"+
		"HELICANUS\n"+
		"Calls my lord?\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"Thou art a grave and noble counsellor,\n"+
		"Most wise in general: tell me, if thou canst,\n"+
		"What this maid is, or what is like to be,\n"+
		"That thus hath made me weep?\n"+
		"HELICANUS\n"+
		"I know not; but\n"+
		"Here is the regent, sir, of Mytilene\n"+
		"Speaks nobly of her.\n"+
		"LYSIMACHUS\n"+
		"She would never tell\n"+
		"Her parentage; being demanded that,\n"+
		"She would sit still and weep.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"O Helicanus, strike me, honour'd sir;\n"+
		"Give me a gash, put me to present pain;\n"+
		"Lest this great sea of joys rushing upon me\n"+
		"O'erbear the shores of my mortality,\n"+
		"And drown me with their sweetness. O, come hither,\n"+
		"Thou that beget'st him that did thee beget;\n"+
		"Thou that wast born at sea, buried at Tarsus,\n"+
		"And found at sea again! O Helicanus,\n"+
		"Down on thy knees, thank the holy gods as loud\n"+
		"As thunder threatens us: this is Marina.\n"+
		"What was thy mother's name? tell me but that,\n"+
		"For truth can never be confirm'd enough,\n"+
		"Though doubts did ever sleep.\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"First, sir, I pray,\n"+
		"What is your title?\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"I am Pericles of Tyre: but tell me now\n"+
		"My drown'd queen's name, as in the rest you said\n"+
		"Thou hast been godlike perfect,\n"+
		"The heir of kingdoms and another like\n"+
		"To Pericles thy father.\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"Is it no more to be your daughter than\n"+
		"To say my mother's name was Thaisa?\n"+
		"Thaisa was my mother, who did end\n"+
		"The minute I began.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"Now, blessing on thee! rise; thou art my child.\n"+
		"Give me fresh garments. Mine own, Helicanus;\n"+
		"She is not dead at Tarsus, as she should have been,\n"+
		"By savage Cleon: she shall tell thee all;\n"+
		"When thou shalt kneel, and justify in knowledge\n"+
		"She is thy very princess. Who is this?\n"+
		"HELICANUS\n"+
		"Sir, 'tis the governor of Mytilene,\n"+
		"Who, hearing of your melancholy state,\n"+
		"Did come to see you.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"I embrace you.\n"+
		"Give me my robes. I am wild in my beholding.\n"+
		"O heavens bless my girl! But, hark, what music?\n"+
		"Tell Helicanus, my Marina, tell him\n"+
		"O'er, point by point, for yet he seems to doubt,\n"+
		"How sure you are my daughter. But, what music?\n"+
		"HELICANUS\n"+
		"My lord, I hear none.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"None!\n"+
		"The music of the spheres! List, my Marina.\n"+
		"LYSIMACHUS\n"+
		"It is not good to cross him; give him way.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"Rarest sounds! Do ye not hear?\n"+
		"LYSIMACHUS\n"+
		"My lord, I hear.\n"+
		"Music\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"Most heavenly music!\n"+
		"It nips me unto listening, and thick slumber\n"+
		"Hangs upon mine eyes: let me rest.\n"+
		"Sleeps\n"+
		"LYSIMACHUS\n"+
		"A pillow for his head:\n"+
		"So, leave him all. Well, my companion friends,\n"+
		"If this but answer to my just belief,\n"+
		"I'll well remember you.\n"+
		"Exeunt all but PERICLES\n"+
		"DIANA appears to PERICLES as in a vision\n"+
		"DIANA\n"+
		"My temple stands in Ephesus: hie thee thither,\n"+
		"And do upon mine altar sacrifice.\n"+
		"There, when my maiden priests are met together,\n"+
		"Before the people all,\n"+
		"Reveal how thou at sea didst lose thy wife:\n"+
		"To mourn thy crosses, with thy daughter's, call\n"+
		"And give them repetition to the life.\n"+
		"Or perform my bidding, or thou livest in woe;\n"+
		"Do it, and happy; by my silver bow!\n"+
		"Awake, and tell thy dream.\n"+
		"Disappears\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"Celestial Dian, goddess argentine,\n"+
		"I will obey thee. Helicanus!\n"+
		"Re-enter HELICANUS, LYSIMACHUS, and MARINA\n"+
		"HELICANUS\n"+
		"Sir?\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"My purpose was for Tarsus, there to strike\n"+
		"The inhospitable Cleon; but I am\n"+
		"For other service first: toward Ephesus\n"+
		"Turn our blown sails; eftsoons I'll tell thee why.\n"+
		"To LYSIMACHUS\n"+
		"Shall we refresh us, sir, upon your shore,\n"+
		"And give you gold for such provision\n"+
		"As our intents will need?\n"+
		"LYSIMACHUS\n"+
		"Sir,\n"+
		"With all my heart; and, when you come ashore,\n"+
		"I have another suit.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"You shall prevail,\n"+
		"Were it to woo my daughter; for it seems\n"+
		"You have been noble towards her.\n"+
		"LYSIMACHUS\n"+
		"Sir, lend me your arm.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"Come, my Marina.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II:\n"+
		"Enter GOWER, before the temple of DIANA at Ephesus\n"+
		"GOWER\n"+
		"Now our sands are almost run;\n"+
		"More a little, and then dumb.\n"+
		"This, my last boon, give me,\n"+
		"For such kindness must relieve me,\n"+
		"That you aptly will suppose\n"+
		"What pageantry, what feats, what shows,\n"+
		"What minstrelsy, and pretty din,\n"+
		"The regent made in Mytilene\n"+
		"To greet the king. So he thrived,\n"+
		"That he is promised to be wived\n"+
		"To fair Marina; but in no wise\n"+
		"Till he had done his sacrifice,\n"+
		"As Dian bade: whereto being bound,\n"+
		"The interim, pray you, all confound.\n"+
		"In feather'd briefness sails are fill'd,\n"+
		"And wishes fall out as they're will'd.\n"+
		"At Ephesus, the temple see,\n"+
		"Our king and all his company.\n"+
		"That he can hither come so soon,\n"+
		"Is by your fancy's thankful doom.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE III. The temple of Diana at Ephesus; THAISA standing\n"+
		"near the altar, as high priestess; a number of\n"+
		"Virgins on each side; CERIMON and other Inhabitants\n"+
		"of Ephesus attending.\n"+
		"Enter PERICLES, with his train; LYSIMACHUS, HELICANUS, MARINA, and a Lady\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"Hail, Dian! to perform thy just command,\n"+
		"I here confess myself the king of Tyre;\n"+
		"Who, frighted from my country, did wed\n"+
		"At Pentapolis the fair Thaisa.\n"+
		"At sea in childbed died she, but brought forth\n"+
		"A maid-child call'd Marina; who, O goddess,\n"+
		"Wears yet thy silver livery. She at Tarsus\n"+
		"Was nursed with Cleon; who at fourteen years\n"+
		"He sought to murder: but her better stars\n"+
		"Brought her to Mytilene; 'gainst whose shore\n"+
		"Riding, her fortunes brought the maid aboard us,\n"+
		"Where, by her own most clear remembrance, she\n"+
		"Made known herself my daughter.\n"+
		"THAISA\n"+
		"Voice and favour!\n"+
		"You are, you are--O royal Pericles!\n"+
		"Faints\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"What means the nun? she dies! help, gentlemen!\n"+
		"CERIMON\n"+
		"Noble sir,\n"+
		"If you have told Diana's altar true,\n"+
		"This is your wife.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"Reverend appearer, no;\n"+
		"I threw her overboard with these very arms.\n"+
		"CERIMON\n"+
		"Upon this coast, I warrant you.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"'Tis most certain.\n"+
		"CERIMON\n"+
		"Look to the lady; O, she's but o'erjoy'd.\n"+
		"Early in blustering morn this lady was\n"+
		"Thrown upon this shore. I oped the coffin,\n"+
		"Found there rich jewels; recover'd her, and placed her\n"+
		"Here in Diana's temple.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"May we see them?\n"+
		"CERIMON\n"+
		"Great sir, they shall be brought you to my house,\n"+
		"Whither I invite you. Look, Thaisa is recovered.\n"+
		"THAISA\n"+
		"O, let me look!\n"+
		"If he be none of mine, my sanctity\n"+
		"Will to my sense bend no licentious ear,\n"+
		"But curb it, spite of seeing. O, my lord,\n"+
		"Are you not Pericles? Like him you spake,\n"+
		"Like him you are: did you not name a tempest,\n"+
		"A birth, and death?\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"The voice of dead Thaisa!\n"+
		"THAISA\n"+
		"That Thaisa am I, supposed dead\n"+
		"And drown'd.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"Immortal Dian!\n"+
		"THAISA\n"+
		"Now I know you better.\n"+
		"When we with tears parted Pentapolis,\n"+
		"The king my father gave you such a ring.\n"+
		"Shows a ring\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"This, this: no more, you gods! your present kindness\n"+
		"Makes my past miseries sports: you shall do well,\n"+
		"That on the touching of her lips I may\n"+
		"Melt and no more be seen. O, come, be buried\n"+
		"A second time within these arms.\n"+
		"MARINA\n"+
		"My heart\n"+
		"Leaps to be gone into my mother's bosom.\n"+
		"Kneels to THAISA\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"Look, who kneels here! Flesh of thy flesh, Thaisa;\n"+
		"Thy burden at the sea, and call'd Marina\n"+
		"For she was yielded there.\n"+
		"THAISA\n"+
		"Blest, and mine own!\n"+
		"HELICANUS\n"+
		"Hail, madam, and my queen!\n"+
		"THAISA\n"+
		"I know you not.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"You have heard me say, when I did fly from Tyre,\n"+
		"I left behind an ancient substitute:\n"+
		"Can you remember what I call'd the man?\n"+
		"I have named him oft.\n"+
		"THAISA\n"+
		"'Twas Helicanus then.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"Still confirmation:\n"+
		"Embrace him, dear Thaisa; this is he.\n"+
		"Now do I long to hear how you were found;\n"+
		"How possibly preserved; and who to thank,\n"+
		"Besides the gods, for this great miracle.\n"+
		"THAISA\n"+
		"Lord Cerimon, my lord; this man,\n"+
		"Through whom the gods have shown their power; that can\n"+
		"From first to last resolve you.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"Reverend sir,\n"+
		"The gods can have no mortal officer\n"+
		"More like a god than you. Will you deliver\n"+
		"How this dead queen re-lives?\n"+
		"CERIMON\n"+
		"I will, my lord.\n"+
		"Beseech you, first go with me to my house,\n"+
		"Where shall be shown you all was found with her;\n"+
		"How she came placed here in the temple;\n"+
		"No needful thing omitted.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"Pure Dian, bless thee for thy vision! I\n"+
		"Will offer night-oblations to thee. Thaisa,\n"+
		"This prince, the fair-betrothed of your daughter,\n"+
		"Shall marry her at Pentapolis. And now,\n"+
		"This ornament\n"+
		"Makes me look dismal will I clip to form;\n"+
		"And what this fourteen years no razor touch'd,\n"+
		"To grace thy marriage-day, I'll beautify.\n"+
		"THAISA\n"+
		"Lord Cerimon hath letters of good credit, sir,\n"+
		"My father's dead.\n"+
		"PERICLES\n"+
		"Heavens make a star of him! Yet there, my queen,\n"+
		"We'll celebrate their nuptials, and ourselves\n"+
		"Will in that kingdom spend our following days:\n"+
		"Our son and daughter shall in Tyrus reign.\n"+
		"Lord Cerimon, we do our longing stay\n"+
		"To hear the rest untold: sir, lead's the way.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"Enter GOWER\n"+
		"GOWER\n"+
		"In Antiochus and his daughter you have heard\n"+
		"Of monstrous lust the due and just reward:\n"+
		"In Pericles, his queen and daughter, seen,\n"+
		"Although assail'd with fortune fierce and keen,\n"+
		"Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,\n"+
		"Led on by heaven, and crown'd with joy at last:\n"+
		"In Helicanus may you well descry\n"+
		"A figure of truth, of faith, of loyalty:\n"+
		"In reverend Cerimon there well appears\n"+
		"The worth that learned charity aye wears:\n"+
		"For wicked Cleon and his wife, when fame\n"+
		"Had spread their cursed deed, and honour'd name\n"+
		"Of Pericles, to rage the city turn,\n"+
		"That him and his they in his palace burn;\n"+
		"The gods for murder seemed so content\n"+
		"To punish them; although not done, but meant.\n"+
		"So, on your patience evermore attending,\n"+
		"New joy wait on you! Here our play has ending.\n"+
		"Exit\n"
