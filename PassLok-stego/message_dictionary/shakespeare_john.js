		"The Life and Death of King John\n"+
		"ACT I\n"+
		"SCENE I. KING JOHN'S palace.\n"+
		"Enter KING JOHN, QUEEN ELINOR, PEMBROKE, ESSEX, SALISBURY, and others, with CHATILLON\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Now, say, Chatillon, what would France with us?\n"+
		"CHATILLON\n"+
		"Thus, after greeting, speaks the King of France\n"+
		"In my behavior to the majesty,\n"+
		"The borrow'd majesty, of England here.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELINOR\n"+
		"A strange beginning: 'borrow'd majesty!'\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Silence, good mother; hear the embassy.\n"+
		"CHATILLON\n"+
		"Philip of France, in right and true behalf\n"+
		"Of thy deceased brother Geffrey's son,\n"+
		"Arthur Plantagenet, lays most lawful claim\n"+
		"To this fair island and the territories,\n"+
		"To Ireland, Poictiers, Anjou, Touraine, Maine,\n"+
		"Desiring thee to lay aside the sword\n"+
		"Which sways usurpingly these several titles,\n"+
		"And put these same into young Arthur's hand,\n"+
		"Thy nephew and right royal sovereign.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"What follows if we disallow of this?\n"+
		"CHATILLON\n"+
		"The proud control of fierce and bloody war,\n"+
		"To enforce these rights so forcibly withheld.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Here have we war for war and blood for blood,\n"+
		"Controlment for controlment: so answer France.\n"+
		"CHATILLON\n"+
		"Then take my king's defiance from my mouth,\n"+
		"The farthest limit of my embassy.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Bear mine to him, and so depart in peace:\n"+
		"Be thou as lightning in the eyes of France;\n"+
		"For ere thou canst report I will be there,\n"+
		"The thunder of my cannon shall be heard:\n"+
		"So hence! Be thou the trumpet of our wrath\n"+
		"And sullen presage of your own decay.\n"+
		"An honourable conduct let him have:\n"+
		"Pembroke, look to 't. Farewell, Chatillon.\n"+
		"Exeunt CHATILLON and PEMBROKE\n"+
		"QUEEN ELINOR\n"+
		"What now, my son! have I not ever said\n"+
		"How that ambitious Constance would not cease\n"+
		"Till she had kindled France and all the world,\n"+
		"Upon the right and party of her son?\n"+
		"This might have been prevented and made whole\n"+
		"With very easy arguments of love,\n"+
		"Which now the manage of two kingdoms must\n"+
		"With fearful bloody issue arbitrate.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Our strong possession and our right for us.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELINOR\n"+
		"Your strong possession much more than your right,\n"+
		"Or else it must go wrong with you and me:\n"+
		"So much my conscience whispers in your ear,\n"+
		"Which none but heaven and you and I shall hear.\n"+
		"Enter a Sheriff\n"+
		"ESSEX\n"+
		"My liege, here is the strangest controversy\n"+
		"Come from country to be judged by you,\n"+
		"That e'er I heard: shall I produce the men?\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Let them approach.\n"+
		"Our abbeys and our priories shall pay\n"+
		"This expedition's charge.\n"+
		"Enter ROBERT and the BASTARD\n"+
		"What men are you?\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"Your faithful subject I, a gentleman\n"+
		"Born in Northamptonshire and eldest son,\n"+
		"As I suppose, to Robert Faulconbridge,\n"+
		"A soldier, by the honour-giving hand\n"+
		"Of Coeur-de-lion knighted in the field.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"What art thou?\n"+
		"ROBERT\n"+
		"The son and heir to that same Faulconbridge.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Is that the elder, and art thou the heir?\n"+
		"You came not of one mother then, it seems.\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"Most certain of one mother, mighty king;\n"+
		"That is well known; and, as I think, one father:\n"+
		"But for the certain knowledge of that truth\n"+
		"I put you o'er to heaven and to my mother:\n"+
		"Of that I doubt, as all men's children may.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELINOR\n"+
		"Out on thee, rude man! thou dost shame thy mother\n"+
		"And wound her honour with this diffidence.\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"I, madam? no, I have no reason for it;\n"+
		"That is my brother's plea and none of mine;\n"+
		"The which if he can prove, a' pops me out\n"+
		"At least from fair five hundred pound a year:\n"+
		"Heaven guard my mother's honour and my land!\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"A good blunt fellow. Why, being younger born,\n"+
		"Doth he lay claim to thine inheritance?\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"I know not why, except to get the land.\n"+
		"But once he slander'd me with bastardy:\n"+
		"But whether I be as true begot or no,\n"+
		"That still I lay upon my mother's head,\n"+
		"But that I am as well begot, my liege,--\n"+
		"Fair fall the bones that took the pains for me!--\n"+
		"Compare our faces and be judge yourself.\n"+
		"If old sir Robert did beget us both\n"+
		"And were our father and this son like him,\n"+
		"O old sir Robert, father, on my knee\n"+
		"I give heaven thanks I was not like to thee!\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Why, what a madcap hath heaven lent us here!\n"+
		"QUEEN ELINOR\n"+
		"He hath a trick of Coeur-de-lion's face;\n"+
		"The accent of his tongue affecteth him.\n"+
		"Do you not read some tokens of my son\n"+
		"In the large composition of this man?\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Mine eye hath well examined his parts\n"+
		"And finds them perfect Richard. Sirrah, speak,\n"+
		"What doth move you to claim your brother's land?\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"Because he hath a half-face, like my father.\n"+
		"With half that face would he have all my land:\n"+
		"A half-faced groat five hundred pound a year!\n"+
		"ROBERT\n"+
		"My gracious liege, when that my father lived,\n"+
		"Your brother did employ my father much,--\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"Well, sir, by this you cannot get my land:\n"+
		"Your tale must be how he employ'd my mother.\n"+
		"ROBERT\n"+
		"And once dispatch'd him in an embassy\n"+
		"To Germany, there with the emperor\n"+
		"To treat of high affairs touching that time.\n"+
		"The advantage of his absence took the king\n"+
		"And in the mean time sojourn'd at my father's;\n"+
		"Where how he did prevail I shame to speak,\n"+
		"But truth is truth: large lengths of seas and shores\n"+
		"Between my father and my mother lay,\n"+
		"As I have heard my father speak himself,\n"+
		"When this same lusty gentleman was got.\n"+
		"Upon his death-bed he by will bequeath'd\n"+
		"His lands to me, and took it on his death\n"+
		"That this my mother's son was none of his;\n"+
		"And if he were, he came into the world\n"+
		"Full fourteen weeks before the course of time.\n"+
		"Then, good my liege, let me have what is mine,\n"+
		"My father's land, as was my father's will.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Sirrah, your brother is legitimate;\n"+
		"Your father's wife did after wedlock bear him,\n"+
		"And if she did play false, the fault was hers;\n"+
		"Which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands\n"+
		"That marry wives. Tell me, how if my brother,\n"+
		"Who, as you say, took pains to get this son,\n"+
		"Had of your father claim'd this son for his?\n"+
		"In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept\n"+
		"This calf bred from his cow from all the world;\n"+
		"In sooth he might; then, if he were my brother's,\n"+
		"My brother might not claim him; nor your father,\n"+
		"Being none of his, refuse him: this concludes;\n"+
		"My mother's son did get your father's heir;\n"+
		"Your father's heir must have your father's land.\n"+
		"ROBERT\n"+
		"Shall then my father's will be of no force\n"+
		"To dispossess that child which is not his?\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"Of no more force to dispossess me, sir,\n"+
		"Than was his will to get me, as I think.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELINOR\n"+
		"Whether hadst thou rather be a Faulconbridge\n"+
		"And like thy brother, to enjoy thy land,\n"+
		"Or the reputed son of Coeur-de-lion,\n"+
		"Lord of thy presence and no land beside?\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"Madam, an if my brother had my shape,\n"+
		"And I had his, sir Robert's his, like him;\n"+
		"And if my legs were two such riding-rods,\n"+
		"My arms such eel-skins stuff'd, my face so thin\n"+
		"That in mine ear I durst not stick a rose\n"+
		"Lest men should say 'Look, where three-farthings goes!'\n"+
		"And, to his shape, were heir to all this land,\n"+
		"Would I might never stir from off this place,\n"+
		"I would give it every foot to have this face;\n"+
		"I would not be sir Nob in any case.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELINOR\n"+
		"I like thee well: wilt thou forsake thy fortune,\n"+
		"Bequeath thy land to him and follow me?\n"+
		"I am a soldier and now bound to France.\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"Brother, take you my land, I'll take my chance.\n"+
		"Your face hath got five hundred pound a year,\n"+
		"Yet sell your face for five pence and 'tis dear.\n"+
		"Madam, I'll follow you unto the death.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELINOR\n"+
		"Nay, I would have you go before me thither.\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"Our country manners give our betters way.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"What is thy name?\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"Philip, my liege, so is my name begun,\n"+
		"Philip, good old sir Robert's wife's eldest son.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"From henceforth bear his name whose form thou bear'st:\n"+
		"Kneel thou down Philip, but rise more great,\n"+
		"Arise sir Richard and Plantagenet.\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"Brother by the mother's side, give me your hand:\n"+
		"My father gave me honour, yours gave land.\n"+
		"Now blessed by the hour, by night or day,\n"+
		"When I was got, sir Robert was away!\n"+
		"QUEEN ELINOR\n"+
		"The very spirit of Plantagenet!\n"+
		"I am thy grandam, Richard; call me so.\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"Madam, by chance but not by truth; what though?\n"+
		"Something about, a little from the right,\n"+
		"In at the window, or else o'er the hatch:\n"+
		"Who dares not stir by day must walk by night,\n"+
		"And have is have, however men do catch:\n"+
		"Near or far off, well won is still well shot,\n"+
		"And I am I, howe'er I was begot.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Go, Faulconbridge: now hast thou thy desire;\n"+
		"A landless knight makes thee a landed squire.\n"+
		"Come, madam, and come, Richard, we must speed\n"+
		"For France, for France, for it is more than need.\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"Brother, adieu: good fortune come to thee!\n"+
		"For thou wast got i' the way of honesty.\n"+
		"Exeunt all but BASTARD\n"+
		"A foot of honour better than I was;\n"+
		"But many a many foot of land the worse.\n"+
		"Well, now can I make any Joan a lady.\n"+
		"'Good den, sir Richard!'--'God-a-mercy, fellow!'--\n"+
		"And if his name be George, I'll call him Peter;\n"+
		"For new-made honour doth forget men's names;\n"+
		"'Tis too respective and too sociable\n"+
		"For your conversion. Now your traveller,\n"+
		"He and his toothpick at my worship's mess,\n"+
		"And when my knightly stomach is sufficed,\n"+
		"Why then I suck my teeth and catechise\n"+
		"My picked man of countries: 'My dear sir,'\n"+
		"Thus, leaning on mine elbow, I begin,\n"+
		"'I shall beseech you'--that is question now;\n"+
		"And then comes answer like an Absey book:\n"+
		"'O sir,' says answer, 'at your best command;\n"+
		"At your employment; at your service, sir;'\n"+
		"'No, sir,' says question, 'I, sweet sir, at yours:'\n"+
		"And so, ere answer knows what question would,\n"+
		"Saving in dialogue of compliment,\n"+
		"And talking of the Alps and Apennines,\n"+
		"The Pyrenean and the river Po,\n"+
		"It draws toward supper in conclusion so.\n"+
		"But this is worshipful society\n"+
		"And fits the mounting spirit like myself,\n"+
		"For he is but a bastard to the time\n"+
		"That doth not smack of observation;\n"+
		"And so am I, whether I smack or no;\n"+
		"And not alone in habit and device,\n"+
		"Exterior form, outward accoutrement,\n"+
		"But from the inward motion to deliver\n"+
		"Sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age's tooth:\n"+
		"Which, though I will not practise to deceive,\n"+
		"Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;\n"+
		"For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising.\n"+
		"But who comes in such haste in riding-robes?\n"+
		"What woman-post is this? hath she no husband\n"+
		"That will take pains to blow a horn before her?\n"+
		"Enter LADY FAULCONBRIDGE and GURNEY\n"+
		"O me! it is my mother. How now, good lady!\n"+
		"What brings you here to court so hastily?\n"+
		"LADY FAULCONBRIDGE\n"+
		"Where is that slave, thy brother? where is he,\n"+
		"That holds in chase mine honour up and down?\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"My brother Robert? old sir Robert's son?\n"+
		"Colbrand the giant, that same mighty man?\n"+
		"Is it sir Robert's son that you seek so?\n"+
		"LADY FAULCONBRIDGE\n"+
		"Sir Robert's son! Ay, thou unreverend boy,\n"+
		"Sir Robert's son: why scorn'st thou at sir Robert?\n"+
		"He is sir Robert's son, and so art thou.\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"James Gurney, wilt thou give us leave awhile?\n"+
		"GURNEY\n"+
		"Good leave, good Philip.\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"Philip! sparrow: James,\n"+
		"There's toys abroad: anon I'll tell thee more.\n"+
		"Exit GURNEY\n"+
		"Madam, I was not old sir Robert's son:\n"+
		"Sir Robert might have eat his part in me\n"+
		"Upon Good-Friday and ne'er broke his fast:\n"+
		"Sir Robert could do well: marry, to confess,\n"+
		"Could he get me? Sir Robert could not do it:\n"+
		"We know his handiwork: therefore, good mother,\n"+
		"To whom am I beholding for these limbs?\n"+
		"Sir Robert never holp to make this leg.\n"+
		"LADY FAULCONBRIDGE\n"+
		"Hast thou conspired with thy brother too,\n"+
		"That for thine own gain shouldst defend mine honour?\n"+
		"What means this scorn, thou most untoward knave?\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"Knight, knight, good mother, Basilisco-like.\n"+
		"What! I am dubb'd! I have it on my shoulder.\n"+
		"But, mother, I am not sir Robert's son;\n"+
		"I have disclaim'd sir Robert and my land;\n"+
		"Legitimation, name and all is gone:\n"+
		"Then, good my mother, let me know my father;\n"+
		"Some proper man, I hope: who was it, mother?\n"+
		"LADY FAULCONBRIDGE\n"+
		"Hast thou denied thyself a Faulconbridge?\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"As faithfully as I deny the devil.\n"+
		"LADY FAULCONBRIDGE\n"+
		"King Richard Coeur-de-lion was thy father:\n"+
		"By long and vehement suit I was seduced\n"+
		"To make room for him in my husband's bed:\n"+
		"Heaven lay not my transgression to my charge!\n"+
		"Thou art the issue of my dear offence,\n"+
		"Which was so strongly urged past my defence.\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"Now, by this light, were I to get again,\n"+
		"Madam, I would not wish a better father.\n"+
		"Some sins do bear their privilege on earth,\n"+
		"And so doth yours; your fault was not your folly:\n"+
		"Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose,\n"+
		"Subjected tribute to commanding love,\n"+
		"Against whose fury and unmatched force\n"+
		"The aweless lion could not wage the fight,\n"+
		"Nor keep his princely heart from Richard's hand.\n"+
		"He that perforce robs lions of their hearts\n"+
		"May easily win a woman's. Ay, my mother,\n"+
		"With all my heart I thank thee for my father!\n"+
		"Who lives and dares but say thou didst not well\n"+
		"When I was got, I'll send his soul to hell.\n"+
		"Come, lady, I will show thee to my kin;\n"+
		"And they shall say, when Richard me begot,\n"+
		"If thou hadst said him nay, it had been sin:\n"+
		"Who says it was, he lies; I say 'twas not.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT II\n"+
		"SCENE I. France. Before Angiers.\n"+
		"Enter AUSTRIA and forces, drums, etc. on one side: on the other KING PHILIP and his power; LEWIS, ARTHUR, CONSTANCE and attendants\n"+
		"LEWIS\n"+
		"Before Angiers well met, brave Austria.\n"+
		"Arthur, that great forerunner of thy blood,\n"+
		"Richard, that robb'd the lion of his heart\n"+
		"And fought the holy wars in Palestine,\n"+
		"By this brave duke came early to his grave:\n"+
		"And for amends to his posterity,\n"+
		"At our importance hither is he come,\n"+
		"To spread his colours, boy, in thy behalf,\n"+
		"And to rebuke the usurpation\n"+
		"Of thy unnatural uncle, English John:\n"+
		"Embrace him, love him, give him welcome hither.\n"+
		"ARTHUR\n"+
		"God shall forgive you Coeur-de-lion's death\n"+
		"The rather that you give his offspring life,\n"+
		"Shadowing their right under your wings of war:\n"+
		"I give you welcome with a powerless hand,\n"+
		"But with a heart full of unstained love:\n"+
		"Welcome before the gates of Angiers, duke.\n"+
		"LEWIS\n"+
		"A noble boy! Who would not do thee right?\n"+
		"AUSTRIA\n"+
		"Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss,\n"+
		"As seal to this indenture of my love,\n"+
		"That to my home I will no more return,\n"+
		"Till Angiers and the right thou hast in France,\n"+
		"Together with that pale, that white-faced shore,\n"+
		"Whose foot spurns back the ocean's roaring tides\n"+
		"And coops from other lands her islanders,\n"+
		"Even till that England, hedged in with the main,\n"+
		"That water-walled bulwark, still secure\n"+
		"And confident from foreign purposes,\n"+
		"Even till that utmost corner of the west\n"+
		"Salute thee for her king: till then, fair boy,\n"+
		"Will I not think of home, but follow arms.\n"+
		"CONSTANCE\n"+
		"O, take his mother's thanks, a widow's thanks,\n"+
		"Till your strong hand shall help to give him strength\n"+
		"To make a more requital to your love!\n"+
		"AUSTRIA\n"+
		"The peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords\n"+
		"In such a just and charitable war.\n"+
		"KING PHILIP\n"+
		"Well then, to work: our cannon shall be bent\n"+
		"Against the brows of this resisting town.\n"+
		"Call for our chiefest men of discipline,\n"+
		"To cull the plots of best advantages:\n"+
		"We'll lay before this town our royal bones,\n"+
		"Wade to the market-place in Frenchmen's blood,\n"+
		"But we will make it subject to this boy.\n"+
		"CONSTANCE\n"+
		"Stay for an answer to your embassy,\n"+
		"Lest unadvised you stain your swords with blood:\n"+
		"My Lord Chatillon may from England bring,\n"+
		"That right in peace which here we urge in war,\n"+
		"And then we shall repent each drop of blood\n"+
		"That hot rash haste so indirectly shed.\n"+
		"Enter CHATILLON\n"+
		"KING PHILIP\n"+
		"A wonder, lady! lo, upon thy wish,\n"+
		"Our messenger Chatillon is arrived!\n"+
		"What England says, say briefly, gentle lord;\n"+
		"We coldly pause for thee; Chatillon, speak.\n"+
		"CHATILLON\n"+
		"Then turn your forces from this paltry siege\n"+
		"And stir them up against a mightier task.\n"+
		"England, impatient of your just demands,\n"+
		"Hath put himself in arms: the adverse winds,\n"+
		"Whose leisure I have stay'd, have given him time\n"+
		"To land his legions all as soon as I;\n"+
		"His marches are expedient to this town,\n"+
		"His forces strong, his soldiers confident.\n"+
		"With him along is come the mother-queen,\n"+
		"An Ate, stirring him to blood and strife;\n"+
		"With her her niece, the Lady Blanch of Spain;\n"+
		"With them a bastard of the king's deceased,\n"+
		"And all the unsettled humours of the land,\n"+
		"Rash, inconsiderate, fiery voluntaries,\n"+
		"With ladies' faces and fierce dragons' spleens,\n"+
		"Have sold their fortunes at their native homes,\n"+
		"Bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs,\n"+
		"To make hazard of new fortunes here:\n"+
		"In brief, a braver choice of dauntless spirits\n"+
		"Than now the English bottoms have waft o'er\n"+
		"Did nearer float upon the swelling tide,\n"+
		"To do offence and scath in Christendom.\n"+
		"Drum beats\n"+
		"The interruption of their churlish drums\n"+
		"Cuts off more circumstance: they are at hand,\n"+
		"To parley or to fight; therefore prepare.\n"+
		"KING PHILIP\n"+
		"How much unlook'd for is this expedition!\n"+
		"AUSTRIA\n"+
		"By how much unexpected, by so much\n"+
		"We must awake endavour for defence;\n"+
		"For courage mounteth with occasion:\n"+
		"Let them be welcome then: we are prepared.\n"+
		"Enter KING JOHN, QUEEN ELINOR, BLANCH, the BASTARD, Lords, and forces\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Peace be to France, if France in peace permit\n"+
		"Our just and lineal entrance to our own;\n"+
		"If not, bleed France, and peace ascend to heaven,\n"+
		"Whiles we, God's wrathful agent, do correct\n"+
		"Their proud contempt that beats His peace to heaven.\n"+
		"KING PHILIP\n"+
		"Peace be to England, if that war return\n"+
		"From France to England, there to live in peace.\n"+
		"England we love; and for that England's sake\n"+
		"With burden of our armour here we sweat.\n"+
		"This toil of ours should be a work of thine;\n"+
		"But thou from loving England art so far,\n"+
		"That thou hast under-wrought his lawful king\n"+
		"Cut off the sequence of posterity,\n"+
		"Out-faced infant state and done a rape\n"+
		"Upon the maiden virtue of the crown.\n"+
		"Look here upon thy brother Geffrey's face;\n"+
		"These eyes, these brows, were moulded out of his:\n"+
		"This little abstract doth contain that large\n"+
		"Which died in Geffrey, and the hand of time\n"+
		"Shall draw this brief into as huge a volume.\n"+
		"That Geffrey was thy elder brother born,\n"+
		"And this his son; England was Geffrey's right\n"+
		"And this is Geffrey's: in the name of God\n"+
		"How comes it then that thou art call'd a king,\n"+
		"When living blood doth in these temples beat,\n"+
		"Which owe the crown that thou o'ermasterest?\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"From whom hast thou this great commission, France,\n"+
		"To draw my answer from thy articles?\n"+
		"KING PHILIP\n"+
		"From that supernal judge, that stirs good thoughts\n"+
		"In any breast of strong authority,\n"+
		"To look into the blots and stains of right:\n"+
		"That judge hath made me guardian to this boy:\n"+
		"Under whose warrant I impeach thy wrong\n"+
		"And by whose help I mean to chastise it.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Alack, thou dost usurp authority.\n"+
		"KING PHILIP\n"+
		"Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELINOR\n"+
		"Who is it thou dost call usurper, France?\n"+
		"CONSTANCE\n"+
		"Let me make answer; thy usurping son.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELINOR\n"+
		"Out, insolent! thy bastard shall be king,\n"+
		"That thou mayst be a queen, and cheque the world!\n"+
		"CONSTANCE\n"+
		"My bed was ever to thy son as true\n"+
		"As thine was to thy husband; and this boy\n"+
		"Liker in feature to his father Geffrey\n"+
		"Than thou and John in manners; being as like\n"+
		"As rain to water, or devil to his dam.\n"+
		"My boy a bastard! By my soul, I think\n"+
		"His father never was so true begot:\n"+
		"It cannot be, an if thou wert his mother.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELINOR\n"+
		"There's a good mother, boy, that blots thy father.\n"+
		"CONSTANCE\n"+
		"There's a good grandam, boy, that would blot thee.\n"+
		"AUSTRIA\n"+
		"Peace!\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"Hear the crier.\n"+
		"AUSTRIA\n"+
		"What the devil art thou?\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"One that will play the devil, sir, with you,\n"+
		"An a' may catch your hide and you alone:\n"+
		"You are the hare of whom the proverb goes,\n"+
		"Whose valour plucks dead lions by the beard;\n"+
		"I'll smoke your skin-coat, an I catch you right;\n"+
		"Sirrah, look to't; i' faith, I will, i' faith.\n"+
		"BLANCH\n"+
		"O, well did he become that lion's robe\n"+
		"That did disrobe the lion of that robe!\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"It lies as sightly on the back of him\n"+
		"As great Alcides' shows upon an ass:\n"+
		"But, ass, I'll take that burthen from your back,\n"+

		"KING PHILIP\n"+
		"Lewis, determine what we shall do straight.\n"+
		"LEWIS\n"+
		"Women and fools, break off your conference.\n"+
		"King John, this is the very sum of all;\n"+
		"England and Ireland, Anjou, Touraine, Maine,\n"+
		"In right of Arthur do I claim of thee:\n"+
		"Wilt thou resign them and lay down thy arms?\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"My life as soon: I do defy thee, France.\n"+
		"Arthur of Bretagne, yield thee to my hand;\n"+
		"And out of my dear love I'll give thee more\n"+
		"Than e'er the coward hand of France can win:\n"+
		"Submit thee, boy.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELINOR\n"+
		"Come to thy grandam, child.\n"+
		"CONSTANCE\n"+
		"Do, child, go to it grandam, child:\n"+
		"Give grandam kingdom, and it grandam will\n"+
		"Give it a plum, a cherry, and a fig:\n"+
		"There's a good grandam.\n"+
		"ARTHUR\n"+
		"Good my mother, peace!\n"+
		"I would that I were low laid in my grave:\n"+
		"I am not worth this coil that's made for me.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELINOR\n"+
		"His mother shames him so, poor boy, he weeps.\n"+
		"CONSTANCE\n"+
		"Now shame upon you, whether she does or no!\n"+
		"His grandam's wrongs, and not his mother's shames,\n"+
		"Draws those heaven-moving pearls from his poor eyes,\n"+
		"Which heaven shall take in nature of a fee;\n"+
		"Ay, with these crystal beads heaven shall be bribed\n"+
		"To do him justice and revenge on you.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELINOR\n"+
		"Thou monstrous slanderer of heaven and earth!\n"+
		"CONSTANCE\n"+
		"Thou monstrous injurer of heaven and earth!\n"+
		"Call not me slanderer; thou and thine usurp\n"+
		"The dominations, royalties and rights\n"+
		"Of this oppressed boy: this is thy eld'st son's son,\n"+
		"Infortunate in nothing but in thee:\n"+
		"Thy sins are visited in this poor child;\n"+
		"The canon of the law is laid on him,\n"+

		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Bedlam, have done.\n"+
		"CONSTANCE\n"+
		"I have but this to say,\n"+
		"That he is not only plagued for her sin,\n"+
		"But God hath made her sin and her the plague\n"+
		"On this removed issue, plague for her\n"+
		"And with her plague; her sin his injury,\n"+
		"Her injury the beadle to her sin,\n"+

		"It ill beseems this presence to cry aim\n"+

		"Some trumpet summon hither to the walls\n"+

		"Whose title they admit, Arthur's or John's.\n"+
		"Trumpet sounds. Enter certain Citizens upon the walls\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"Who is it that hath warn'd us to the walls?\n"+
		"KING PHILIP\n"+
		"'Tis France, for England.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"England, for itself.\n"+
		"You men of Angiers, and my loving subjects--\n"+
		"KING PHILIP\n"+
		"You loving men of Angiers, Arthur's subjects,\n"+
		"Our trumpet call'd you to this gentle parle--\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"For our advantage; therefore hear us first.\n"+
		"These flags of France, that are advanced here\n"+
		"Before the eye and prospect of your town,\n"+
		"Have hither march'd to your endamagement:\n"+
		"The cannons have their bowels full of wrath,\n"+
		"And ready mounted are they to spit forth\n"+
		"Their iron indignation 'gainst your walls:\n"+
		"All preparation for a bloody siege\n"+
		"All merciless proceeding by these French\n"+
		"Confronts your city's eyes, your winking gates;\n"+
		"And but for our approach those sleeping stones,\n"+
		"That as a waist doth girdle you about,\n"+
		"By the compulsion of their ordinance\n"+
		"By this time from their fixed beds of lime\n"+
		"Had been dishabited, and wide havoc made\n"+
		"For bloody power to rush upon your peace.\n"+
		"But on the sight of us your lawful king,\n"+
		"Who painfully with much expedient march\n"+
		"Have brought a countercheque before your gates,\n"+
		"To save unscratch'd your city's threatened cheeks,\n"+
		"Behold, the French amazed vouchsafe a parle;\n"+
		"And now, instead of bullets wrapp'd in fire,\n"+
		"To make a shaking fever in your walls,\n"+
		"They shoot but calm words folded up in smoke,\n"+
		"To make a faithless error in your ears:\n"+
		"Which trust accordingly, kind citizens,\n"+
		"And let us in, your king, whose labour'd spirits,\n"+
		"Forwearied in this action of swift speed,\n"+
		"Crave harbourage within your city walls.\n"+
		"KING PHILIP\n"+
		"When I have said, make answer to us both.\n"+
		"Lo, in this right hand, whose protection\n"+
		"Is most divinely vow'd upon the right\n"+
		"Of him it holds, stands young Plantagenet,\n"+
		"Son to the elder brother of this man,\n"+
		"And king o'er him and all that he enjoys:\n"+
		"For this down-trodden equity, we tread\n"+
		"In warlike march these greens before your town,\n"+
		"Being no further enemy to you\n"+
		"Than the constraint of hospitable zeal\n"+
		"In the relief of this oppressed child\n"+
		"Religiously provokes. Be pleased then\n"+
		"To pay that duty which you truly owe\n"+
		"To that owes it, namely this young prince:\n"+
		"And then our arms, like to a muzzled bear,\n"+
		"Save in aspect, hath all offence seal'd up;\n"+
		"Our cannons' malice vainly shall be spent\n"+
		"Against the invulnerable clouds of heaven;\n"+
		"And with a blessed and unvex'd retire,\n"+
		"With unhack'd swords and helmets all unbruised,\n"+
		"We will bear home that lusty blood again\n"+
		"Which here we came to spout against your town,\n"+
		"And leave your children, wives and you in peace.\n"+
		"But if you fondly pass our proffer'd offer,\n"+
		"'Tis not the roundure of your old-faced walls\n"+
		"Can hide you from our messengers of war,\n"+
		"Though all these English and their discipline\n"+
		"Were harbour'd in their rude circumference.\n"+
		"Then tell us, shall your city call us lord,\n"+
		"In that behalf which we have challenged it?\n"+
		"Or shall we give the signal to our rage\n"+
		"And stalk in blood to our possession?\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"In brief, we are the king of England's subjects:\n"+
		"For him, and in his right, we hold this town.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Acknowledge then the king, and let me in.\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"That can we not; but he that proves the king,\n"+
		"To him will we prove loyal: till that time\n"+
		"Have we ramm'd up our gates against the world.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Doth not the crown of England prove the king?\n"+
		"And if not that, I bring you witnesses,\n"+
		"Twice fifteen thousand hearts of England's breed,--\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"Bastards, and else.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"To verify our title with their lives.\n"+
		"KING PHILIP\n"+
		"As many and as well-born bloods as those,--\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"Some bastards too.\n"+
		"KING PHILIP\n"+
		"Stand in his face to contradict his claim.\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"Till you compound whose right is worthiest,\n"+
		"We for the worthiest hold the right from both.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Then God forgive the sin of all those souls\n"+
		"That to their everlasting residence,\n"+
		"Before the dew of evening fall, shall fleet,\n"+
		"In dreadful trial of our kingdom's king!\n"+
		"KING PHILIP\n"+
		"Amen, amen! Mount, chevaliers! to arms!\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"Saint George, that swinged the dragon, and e'er since\n"+
		"Sits on his horseback at mine hostess' door,\n"+
		"Teach us some fence!\n"+
		"To AUSTRIA\n"+
		"Sirrah, were I at home,\n"+
		"At your den, sirrah, with your lioness\n"+
		"I would set an ox-head to your lion's hide,\n"+
		"And make a monster of you.\n"+
		"AUSTRIA\n"+
		"Peace! no more.\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"O tremble, for you hear the lion roar.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Up higher to the plain; where we'll set forth\n"+
		"In best appointment all our regiments.\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"Speed then, to take advantage of the field.\n"+
		"KING PHILIP\n"+
		"It shall be so; and at the other hill\n"+
		"Command the rest to stand. God and our right!\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"Here after excursions, enter the Herald of France, with trumpets, to the gates\n"+
		"French Herald\n"+
		"You men of Angiers, open wide your gates,\n"+
		"And let young Arthur, Duke of Bretagne, in,\n"+
		"Who by the hand of France this day hath made\n"+
		"Much work for tears in many an English mother,\n"+
		"Whose sons lie scattered on the bleeding ground;\n"+
		"Many a widow's husband grovelling lies,\n"+
		"Coldly embracing the discolour'd earth;\n"+
		"And victory, with little loss, doth play\n"+
		"Upon the dancing banners of the French,\n"+
		"Who are at hand, triumphantly display'd,\n"+
		"To enter conquerors and to proclaim\n"+
		"Arthur of Bretagne England's king and yours.\n"+
		"Enter English Herald, with trumpet\n"+
		"English Herald\n"+
		"Rejoice, you men of Angiers, ring your bells:\n"+
		"King John, your king and England's doth approach,\n"+
		"Commander of this hot malicious day:\n"+
		"Their armours, that march'd hence so silver-bright,\n"+
		"Hither return all gilt with Frenchmen's blood;\n"+
		"There stuck no plume in any English crest\n"+
		"That is removed by a staff of France;\n"+
		"Our colours do return in those same hands\n"+
		"That did display them when we first march'd forth;\n"+
		"And, like a troop of jolly huntsmen, come\n"+
		"Our lusty English, all with purpled hands,\n"+
		"Dyed in the dying slaughter of their foes:\n"+
		"Open your gates and gives the victors way.\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"Heralds, from off our towers we might behold,\n"+
		"From first to last, the onset and retire\n"+
		"Of both your armies; whose equality\n"+
		"By our best eyes cannot be censured:\n"+
		"Blood hath bought blood and blows have answered blows;\n"+
		"Strength match'd with strength, and power confronted power:\n"+
		"Both are alike; and both alike we like.\n"+
		"One must prove greatest: while they weigh so even,\n"+
		"We hold our town for neither, yet for both.\n"+
		"Re-enter KING JOHN and KING PHILIP, with their powers, severally\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"France, hast thou yet more blood to cast away?\n"+
		"Say, shall the current of our right run on?\n"+
		"Whose passage, vex'd with thy impediment,\n"+
		"Shall leave his native channel and o'erswell\n"+
		"With course disturb'd even thy confining shores,\n"+
		"Unless thou let his silver water keep\n"+
		"A peaceful progress to the ocean.\n"+
		"KING PHILIP\n"+
		"England, thou hast not saved one drop of blood,\n"+
		"In this hot trial, more than we of France;\n"+
		"Rather, lost more. And by this hand I swear,\n"+
		"That sways the earth this climate overlooks,\n"+
		"Before we will lay down our just-borne arms,\n"+
		"We'll put thee down, 'gainst whom these arms we bear,\n"+
		"Or add a royal number to the dead,\n"+
		"Gracing the scroll that tells of this war's loss\n"+
		"With slaughter coupled to the name of kings.\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"Ha, majesty! how high thy glory towers,\n"+
		"When the rich blood of kings is set on fire!\n"+
		"O, now doth Death line his dead chaps with steel;\n"+
		"The swords of soldiers are his teeth, his fangs;\n"+
		"And now he feasts, mousing the flesh of men,\n"+
		"In undetermined differences of kings.\n"+
		"Why stand these royal fronts amazed thus?\n"+
		"Cry, 'havoc!' kings; back to the stained field,\n"+
		"You equal potents, fiery kindled spirits!\n"+
		"Then let confusion of one part confirm\n"+
		"The other's peace: till then, blows, blood and death!\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Whose party do the townsmen yet admit?\n"+
		"KING PHILIP\n"+
		"Speak, citizens, for England; who's your king?\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"The king of England; when we know the king.\n"+
		"KING PHILIP\n"+
		"Know him in us, that here hold up his right.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"In us, that are our own great deputy\n"+
		"And bear possession of our person here,\n"+
		"Lord of our presence, Angiers, and of you.\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"A greater power then we denies all this;\n"+
		"And till it be undoubted, we do lock\n"+
		"Our former scruple in our strong-barr'd gates;\n"+
		"King'd of our fears, until our fears, resolved,\n"+
		"Be by some certain king purged and deposed.\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"By heaven, these scroyles of Angiers flout you, kings,\n"+
		"And stand securely on their battlements,\n"+
		"As in a theatre, whence they gape and point\n"+
		"At your industrious scenes and acts of death.\n"+
		"Your royal presences be ruled by me:\n"+
		"Do like the mutines of Jerusalem,\n"+
		"Be friends awhile and both conjointly bend\n"+
		"Your sharpest deeds of malice on this town:\n"+
		"By east and west let France and England mount\n"+
		"Their battering cannon charged to the mouths,\n"+
		"Till their soul-fearing clamours have brawl'd down\n"+
		"The flinty ribs of this contemptuous city:\n"+
		"I'ld play incessantly upon these jades,\n"+
		"Even till unfenced desolation\n"+
		"Leave them as naked as the vulgar air.\n"+
		"That done, dissever your united strengths,\n"+
		"And part your mingled colours once again;\n"+
		"Turn face to face and bloody point to point;\n"+
		"Then, in a moment, Fortune shall cull forth\n"+
		"Out of one side her happy minion,\n"+
		"To whom in favour she shall give the day,\n"+
		"And kiss him with a glorious victory.\n"+
		"How like you this wild counsel, mighty states?\n"+
		"Smacks it not something of the policy?\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Now, by the sky that hangs above our heads,\n"+
		"I like it well. France, shall we knit our powers\n"+
		"And lay this Angiers even to the ground;\n"+
		"Then after fight who shall be king of it?\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"An if thou hast the mettle of a king,\n"+
		"Being wronged as we are by this peevish town,\n"+
		"Turn thou the mouth of thy artillery,\n"+
		"As we will ours, against these saucy walls;\n"+
		"And when that we have dash'd them to the ground,\n"+
		"Why then defy each other and pell-mell\n"+
		"Make work upon ourselves, for heaven or hell.\n"+
		"KING PHILIP\n"+
		"Let it be so. Say, where will you assault?\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"We from the west will send destruction\n"+
		"Into this city's bosom.\n"+
		"AUSTRIA\n"+
		"I from the north.\n"+
		"KING PHILIP\n"+
		"Our thunder from the south\n"+
		"Shall rain their drift of bullets on this town.\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"O prudent discipline! From north to south:\n"+
		"Austria and France shoot in each other's mouth:\n"+
		"I'll stir them to it. Come, away, away!\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"Hear us, great kings: vouchsafe awhile to stay,\n"+
		"And I shall show you peace and fair-faced league;\n"+
		"Win you this city without stroke or wound;\n"+
		"Rescue those breathing lives to die in beds,\n"+
		"That here come sacrifices for the field:\n"+
		"Persever not, but hear me, mighty kings.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Speak on with favour; we are bent to hear.\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"That daughter there of Spain, the Lady Blanch,\n"+
		"Is niece to England: look upon the years\n"+
		"Of Lewis the Dauphin and that lovely maid:\n"+
		"If lusty love should go in quest of beauty,\n"+
		"Where should he find it fairer than in Blanch?\n"+
		"If zealous love should go in search of virtue,\n"+
		"Where should he find it purer than in Blanch?\n"+
		"If love ambitious sought a match of birth,\n"+
		"Whose veins bound richer blood than Lady Blanch?\n"+
		"Such as she is, in beauty, virtue, birth,\n"+
		"Is the young Dauphin every way complete:\n"+
		"If not complete of, say he is not she;\n"+
		"And she again wants nothing, to name want,\n"+
		"If want it be not that she is not he:\n"+
		"He is the half part of a blessed man,\n"+
		"Left to be finished by such as she;\n"+
		"And she a fair divided excellence,\n"+
		"Whose fulness of perfection lies in him.\n"+
		"O, two such silver currents, when they join,\n"+
		"Do glorify the banks that bound them in;\n"+
		"And two such shores to two such streams made one,\n"+
		"Two such controlling bounds shall you be, kings,\n"+
		"To these two princes, if you marry them.\n"+
		"This union shall do more than battery can\n"+
		"To our fast-closed gates; for at this match,\n"+
		"With swifter spleen than powder can enforce,\n"+
		"The mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope,\n"+
		"And give you entrance: but without this match,\n"+
		"The sea enraged is not half so deaf,\n"+
		"Lions more confident, mountains and rocks\n"+
		"More free from motion, no, not Death himself\n"+
		"In moral fury half so peremptory,\n"+
		"As we to keep this city.\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"Here's a stay\n"+
		"That shakes the rotten carcass of old Death\n"+
		"Out of his rags! Here's a large mouth, indeed,\n"+
		"That spits forth death and mountains, rocks and seas,\n"+
		"Talks as familiarly of roaring lions\n"+
		"As maids of thirteen do of puppy-dogs!\n"+
		"What cannoneer begot this lusty blood?\n"+
		"He speaks plain cannon fire, and smoke and bounce;\n"+
		"He gives the bastinado with his tongue:\n"+
		"Our ears are cudgell'd; not a word of his\n"+
		"But buffets better than a fist of France:\n"+
		"Zounds! I was never so bethump'd with words\n"+
		"Since I first call'd my brother's father dad.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELINOR\n"+
		"Son, list to this conjunction, make this match;\n"+
		"Give with our niece a dowry large enough:\n"+
		"For by this knot thou shalt so surely tie\n"+
		"Thy now unsured assurance to the crown,\n"+
		"That yon green boy shall have no sun to ripe\n"+
		"The bloom that promiseth a mighty fruit.\n"+
		"I see a yielding in the looks of France;\n"+
		"Mark, how they whisper: urge them while their souls\n"+
		"Are capable of this ambition,\n"+
		"Lest zeal, now melted by the windy breath\n"+
		"Of soft petitions, pity and remorse,\n"+
		"Cool and congeal again to what it was.\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"Why answer not the double majesties\n"+
		"This friendly treaty of our threaten'd town?\n"+
		"KING PHILIP\n"+
		"Speak England first, that hath been forward first\n"+
		"To speak unto this city: what say you?\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"If that the Dauphin there, thy princely son,\n"+
		"Can in this book of beauty read 'I love,'\n"+
		"Her dowry shall weigh equal with a queen:\n"+
		"For Anjou and fair Touraine, Maine, Poictiers,\n"+
		"And all that we upon this side the sea,\n"+
		"Except this city now by us besieged,\n"+
		"Find liable to our crown and dignity,\n"+
		"Shall gild her bridal bed and make her rich\n"+
		"In titles, honours and promotions,\n"+
		"As she in beauty, education, blood,\n"+
		"Holds hand with any princess of the world.\n"+
		"KING PHILIP\n"+
		"What say'st thou, boy? look in the lady's face.\n"+
		"LEWIS\n"+
		"I do, my lord; and in her eye I find\n"+
		"A wonder, or a wondrous miracle,\n"+
		"The shadow of myself form'd in her eye:\n"+
		"Which being but the shadow of your son,\n"+
		"Becomes a sun and makes your son a shadow:\n"+
		"I do protest I never loved myself\n"+
		"Till now infixed I beheld myself\n"+
		"Drawn in the flattering table of her eye.\n"+
		"Whispers with BLANCH\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"Drawn in the flattering table of her eye!\n"+
		"Hang'd in the frowning wrinkle of her brow!\n"+
		"And quarter'd in her heart! he doth espy\n"+
		"Himself love's traitor: this is pity now,\n"+
		"That hang'd and drawn and quartered, there should be\n"+
		"In such a love so vile a lout as he.\n"+
		"BLANCH\n"+
		"My uncle's will in this respect is mine:\n"+
		"If he see aught in you that makes him like,\n"+
		"That any thing he sees, which moves his liking,\n"+
		"I can with ease translate it to my will;\n"+
		"Or if you will, to speak more properly,\n"+
		"I will enforce it easily to my love.\n"+
		"Further I will not flatter you, my lord,\n"+
		"That all I see in you is worthy love,\n"+
		"Than this; that nothing do I see in you,\n"+
		"Though churlish thoughts themselves should be your judge,\n"+
		"That I can find should merit any hate.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"What say these young ones? What say you my niece?\n"+
		"BLANCH\n"+
		"That she is bound in honour still to do\n"+
		"What you in wisdom still vouchsafe to say.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Speak then, prince Dauphin; can you love this lady?\n"+
		"LEWIS\n"+
		"Nay, ask me if I can refrain from love;\n"+
		"For I do love her most unfeignedly.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Then do I give Volquessen, Touraine, Maine,\n"+
		"Poictiers and Anjou, these five provinces,\n"+
		"With her to thee; and this addition more,\n"+
		"Full thirty thousand marks of English coin.\n"+
		"Philip of France, if thou be pleased withal,\n"+
		"Command thy son and daughter to join hands.\n"+
		"KING PHILIP\n"+
		"It likes us well; young princes, close your hands.\n"+
		"AUSTRIA\n"+
		"And your lips too; for I am well assured\n"+
		"That I did so when I was first assured.\n"+
		"KING PHILIP\n"+
		"Now, citizens of Angiers, ope your gates,\n"+
		"Let in that amity which you have made;\n"+
		"For at Saint Mary's chapel presently\n"+
		"The rites of marriage shall be solemnized.\n"+
		"Is not the Lady Constance in this troop?\n"+
		"I know she is not, for this match made up\n"+
		"Her presence would have interrupted much:\n"+
		"Where is she and her son? tell me, who knows.\n"+
		"LEWIS\n"+
		"She is sad and passionate at your highness' tent.\n"+
		"KING PHILIP\n"+
		"And, by my faith, this league that we have made\n"+
		"Will give her sadness very little cure.\n"+
		"Brother of England, how may we content\n"+
		"This widow lady? In her right we came;\n"+
		"Which we, God knows, have turn'd another way,\n"+
		"To our own vantage.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"We will heal up all;\n"+
		"For we'll create young Arthur Duke of Bretagne\n"+
		"And Earl of Richmond; and this rich fair town\n"+
		"We make him lord of. Call the Lady Constance;\n"+
		"Some speedy messenger bid her repair\n"+
		"To our solemnity: I trust we shall,\n"+
		"If not fill up the measure of her will,\n"+
		"Yet in some measure satisfy her so\n"+
		"That we shall stop her exclamation.\n"+
		"Go we, as well as haste will suffer us,\n"+
		"To this unlook'd for, unprepared pomp.\n"+
		"Exeunt all but the BASTARD\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"Mad world! mad kings! mad composition!\n"+
		"John, to stop Arthur's title in the whole,\n"+
		"Hath willingly departed with a part,\n"+
		"And France, whose armour conscience buckled on,\n"+
		"Whom zeal and charity brought to the field\n"+
		"As God's own soldier, rounded in the ear\n"+
		"With that same purpose-changer, that sly devil,\n"+
		"That broker, that still breaks the pate of faith,\n"+
		"That daily break-vow, he that wins of all,\n"+
		"Of kings, of beggars, old men, young men, maids,\n"+
		"Who, having no external thing to lose\n"+
		"But the word 'maid,' cheats the poor maid of that,\n"+
		"That smooth-faced gentleman, tickling Commodity,\n"+
		"Commodity, the bias of the world,\n"+
		"The world, who of itself is peised well,\n"+
		"Made to run even upon even ground,\n"+
		"Till this advantage, this vile-drawing bias,\n"+
		"This sway of motion, this Commodity,\n"+
		"Makes it take head from all indifferency,\n"+
		"From all direction, purpose, course, intent:\n"+
		"And this same bias, this Commodity,\n"+
		"This bawd, this broker, this all-changing word,\n"+
		"Clapp'd on the outward eye of fickle France,\n"+
		"Hath drawn him from his own determined aid,\n"+
		"From a resolved and honourable war,\n"+
		"To a most base and vile-concluded peace.\n"+
		"And why rail I on this Commodity?\n"+
		"But for because he hath not woo'd me yet:\n"+
		"Not that I have the power to clutch my hand,\n"+
		"When his fair angels would salute my palm;\n"+
		"But for my hand, as unattempted yet,\n"+
		"Like a poor beggar, raileth on the rich.\n"+
		"Well, whiles I am a beggar, I will rail\n"+
		"And say there is no sin but to be rich;\n"+
		"And being rich, my virtue then shall be\n"+
		"To say there is no vice but beggary.\n"+
		"Since kings break faith upon commodity,\n"+
		"Gain, be my lord, for I will worship thee.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"ACT III\n"+
		"SCENE I. The French King's pavilion.\n"+
		"Enter CONSTANCE, ARTHUR, and SALISBURY\n"+
		"CONSTANCE\n"+
		"Gone to be married! gone to swear a peace!\n"+
		"False blood to false blood join'd! gone to be friends!\n"+
		"Shall Lewis have Blanch, and Blanch those provinces?\n"+
		"It is not so; thou hast misspoke, misheard:\n"+
		"Be well advised, tell o'er thy tale again:\n"+
		"It cannot be; thou dost but say 'tis so:\n"+
		"I trust I may not trust thee; for thy word\n"+
		"Is but the vain breath of a common man:\n"+
		"Believe me, I do not believe thee, man;\n"+
		"I have a king's oath to the contrary.\n"+
		"Thou shalt be punish'd for thus frighting me,\n"+
		"For I am sick and capable of fears,\n"+
		"Oppress'd with wrongs and therefore full of fears,\n"+
		"A widow, husbandless, subject to fears,\n"+
		"A woman, naturally born to fears;\n"+
		"And though thou now confess thou didst but jest,\n"+
		"With my vex'd spirits I cannot take a truce,\n"+
		"But they will quake and tremble all this day.\n"+
		"What dost thou mean by shaking of thy head?\n"+
		"Why dost thou look so sadly on my son?\n"+
		"What means that hand upon that breast of thine?\n"+
		"Why holds thine eye that lamentable rheum,\n"+
		"Like a proud river peering o'er his bounds?\n"+
		"Be these sad signs confirmers of thy words?\n"+
		"Then speak again; not all thy former tale,\n"+
		"But this one word, whether thy tale be true.\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"As true as I believe you think them false\n"+
		"That give you cause to prove my saying true.\n"+
		"CONSTANCE\n"+
		"O, if thou teach me to believe this sorrow,\n"+
		"Teach thou this sorrow how to make me die,\n"+
		"And let belief and life encounter so\n"+
		"As doth the fury of two desperate men\n"+
		"Which in the very meeting fall and die.\n"+
		"Lewis marry Blanch! O boy, then where art thou?\n"+
		"France friend with England, what becomes of me?\n"+
		"Fellow, be gone: I cannot brook thy sight:\n"+
		"This news hath made thee a most ugly man.\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"What other harm have I, good lady, done,\n"+
		"But spoke the harm that is by others done?\n"+
		"CONSTANCE\n"+
		"Which harm within itself so heinous is\n"+
		"As it makes harmful all that speak of it.\n"+
		"ARTHUR\n"+
		"I do beseech you, madam, be content.\n"+
		"CONSTANCE\n"+
		"If thou, that bid'st me be content, wert grim,\n"+
		"Ugly and slanderous to thy mother's womb,\n"+
		"Full of unpleasing blots and sightless stains,\n"+
		"Lame, foolish, crooked, swart, prodigious,\n"+
		"Patch'd with foul moles and eye-offending marks,\n"+
		"I would not care, I then would be content,\n"+
		"For then I should not love thee, no, nor thou\n"+
		"Become thy great birth nor deserve a crown.\n"+
		"But thou art fair, and at thy birth, dear boy,\n"+
		"Nature and Fortune join'd to make thee great:\n"+
		"Of Nature's gifts thou mayst with lilies boast,\n"+
		"And with the half-blown rose. But Fortune, O,\n"+
		"She is corrupted, changed and won from thee;\n"+
		"She adulterates hourly with thine uncle John,\n"+
		"And with her golden hand hath pluck'd on France\n"+
		"To tread down fair respect of sovereignty,\n"+
		"And made his majesty the bawd to theirs.\n"+
		"France is a bawd to Fortune and King John,\n"+
		"That strumpet Fortune, that usurping John!\n"+
		"Tell me, thou fellow, is not France forsworn?\n"+
		"Envenom him with words, or get thee gone\n"+
		"And leave those woes alone which I alone\n"+
		"Am bound to under-bear.\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"Pardon me, madam,\n"+
		"I may not go without you to the kings.\n"+
		"CONSTANCE\n"+
		"Thou mayst, thou shalt; I will not go with thee:\n"+
		"I will instruct my sorrows to be proud;\n"+
		"For grief is proud and makes his owner stoop.\n"+
		"To me and to the state of my great grief\n"+
		"Let kings assemble; for my grief's so great\n"+
		"That no supporter but the huge firm earth\n"+
		"Can hold it up: here I and sorrows sit;\n"+
		"Here is my throne, bid kings come bow to it.\n"+
		"Seats herself on the ground\n"+
		"Enter KING JOHN, KING PHILLIP, LEWIS, BLANCH, QUEEN ELINOR, the BASTARD, AUSTRIA, and Attendants\n"+
		"KING PHILIP\n"+
		"'Tis true, fair daughter; and this blessed day\n"+
		"Ever in France shall be kept festival:\n"+
		"To solemnize this day the glorious sun\n"+
		"Stays in his course and plays the alchemist,\n"+
		"Turning with splendor of his precious eye\n"+
		"The meagre cloddy earth to glittering gold:\n"+
		"The yearly course that brings this day about\n"+
		"Shall never see it but a holiday.\n"+
		"CONSTANCE\n"+
		"A wicked day, and not a holy day!\n"+
		"Rising\n"+
		"What hath this day deserved? what hath it done,\n"+
		"That it in golden letters should be set\n"+
		"Among the high tides in the calendar?\n"+
		"Nay, rather turn this day out of the week,\n"+
		"This day of shame, oppression, perjury.\n"+
		"Or, if it must stand still, let wives with child\n"+
		"Pray that their burthens may not fall this day,\n"+
		"Lest that their hopes prodigiously be cross'd:\n"+
		"But on this day let seamen fear no wreck;\n"+

		"Yea, faith itself to hollow falsehood change!\n"+
		"KING PHILIP\n"+
		"By heaven, lady, you shall have no cause\n"+
		"To curse the fair proceedings of this day:\n"+
		"Have I not pawn'd to you my majesty?\n"+
		"CONSTANCE\n"+
		"You have beguiled me with a counterfeit\n"+
		"Resembling majesty, which, being touch'd and tried,\n"+
		"Proves valueless: you are forsworn, forsworn;\n"+
		"You came in arms to spill mine enemies' blood,\n"+
		"But now in arms you strengthen it with yours:\n"+
		"The grappling vigour and rough frown of war\n"+
		"Is cold in amity and painted peace,\n"+
		"And our oppression hath made up this league.\n"+
		"Arm, arm, you heavens, against these perjured kings!\n"+
		"A widow cries; be husband to me, heavens!\n"+
		"Let not the hours of this ungodly day\n"+
		"Wear out the day in peace; but, ere sunset,\n"+

		"AUSTRIA\n"+
		"Lady Constance, peace!\n"+
		"CONSTANCE\n"+
		"War! war! no peace! peace is to me a war\n"+
		"O Lymoges! O Austria! thou dost shame\n"+
		"That bloody spoil: thou slave, thou wretch, thou coward!\n"+
		"Thou little valiant, great in villany!\n"+
		"Thou ever strong upon the stronger side!\n"+
		"Thou Fortune's champion that dost never fight\n"+
		"But when her humorous ladyship is by\n"+
		"To teach thee safety! thou art perjured too,\n"+
		"And soothest up greatness. What a fool art thou,\n"+
		"A ramping fool, to brag and stamp and swear\n"+
		"Upon my party! Thou cold-blooded slave,\n"+
		"Hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side,\n"+
		"Been sworn my soldier, bidding me depend\n"+
		"Upon thy stars, thy fortune and thy strength,\n"+

		"KING PHILIP\n"+
		"Here comes the holy legate of the pope.\n"+
		"CARDINAL PANDULPH\n"+
		"Hail, you anointed deputies of heaven!\n"+
		"To thee, King John, my holy errand is.\n"+
		"I Pandulph, of fair Milan cardinal,\n"+
		"And from Pope Innocent the legate here,\n"+
		"Do in his name religiously demand\n"+
		"Why thou against the church, our holy mother,\n"+
		"So wilfully dost spurn; and force perforce\n"+
		"Keep Stephen Langton, chosen archbishop\n"+
		"Of Canterbury, from that holy see?\n"+
		"This, in our foresaid holy father's name,\n"+
		"Pope Innocent, I do demand of thee.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"What earthy name to interrogatories\n"+
		"Can task the free breath of a sacred king?\n"+
		"Thou canst not, cardinal, devise a name\n"+
		"So slight, unworthy and ridiculous,\n"+
		"To charge me to an answer, as the pope.\n"+
		"Tell him this tale; and from the mouth of England\n"+
		"Add thus much more, that no Italian priest\n"+
		"Shall tithe or toll in our dominions;\n"+
		"But as we, under heaven, are supreme head,\n"+
		"So under Him that great supremacy,\n"+
		"Where we do reign, we will alone uphold,\n"+
		"Without the assistance of a mortal hand:\n"+
		"So tell the pope, all reverence set apart\n"+
		"To him and his usurp'd authority.\n"+
		"KING PHILIP\n"+
		"Brother of England, you blaspheme in this.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Though you and all the kings of Christendom\n"+
		"Are led so grossly by this meddling priest,\n"+
		"Dreading the curse that money may buy out;\n"+
		"And by the merit of vile gold, dross, dust,\n"+
		"Purchase corrupted pardon of a man,\n"+
		"Who in that sale sells pardon from himself,\n"+
		"Though you and all the rest so grossly led\n"+
		"This juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish,\n"+
		"Yet I alone, alone do me oppose\n"+
		"Against the pope and count his friends my foes.\n"+
		"CARDINAL PANDULPH\n"+
		"Then, by the lawful power that I have,\n"+
		"Thou shalt stand cursed and excommunicate.\n"+
		"And blessed shall he be that doth revolt\n"+
		"From his allegiance to an heretic;\n"+
		"And meritorious shall that hand be call'd,\n"+
		"Canonized and worshipped as a saint,\n"+
		"That takes away by any secret course\n"+
		"Thy hateful life.\n"+
		"CONSTANCE\n"+
		"O, lawful let it be\n"+
		"That I have room with Rome to curse awhile!\n"+
		"Good father cardinal, cry thou amen\n"+
		"To my keen curses; for without my wrong\n"+
		"There is no tongue hath power to curse him right.\n"+
		"CARDINAL PANDULPH\n"+
		"There's law and warrant, lady, for my curse.\n"+
		"CONSTANCE\n"+
		"And for mine too: when law can do no right,\n"+
		"Let it be lawful that law bar no wrong:\n"+
		"Law cannot give my child his kingdom here,\n"+
		"For he that holds his kingdom holds the law;\n"+
		"Therefore, since law itself is perfect wrong,\n"+
		"How can the law forbid my tongue to curse?\n"+
		"CARDINAL PANDULPH\n"+
		"Philip of France, on peril of a curse,\n"+
		"Let go the hand of that arch-heretic;\n"+
		"And raise the power of France upon his head,\n"+
		"Unless he do submit himself to Rome.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELINOR\n"+
		"Look'st thou pale, France? do not let go thy hand.\n"+
		"CONSTANCE\n"+
		"Look to that, devil; lest that France repent,\n"+
		"And by disjoining hands, hell lose a soul.\n"+
		"AUSTRIA\n"+
		"King Philip, listen to the cardinal.\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"And hang a calf's-skin on his recreant limbs.\n"+
		"AUSTRIA\n"+
		"Well, ruffian, I must pocket up these wrongs, Because--\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"Your breeches best may carry them.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Philip, what say'st thou to the cardinal?\n"+
		"CONSTANCE\n"+
		"What should he say, but as the cardinal?\n"+
		"LEWIS\n"+
		"Bethink you, father; for the difference\n"+
		"Is purchase of a heavy curse from Rome,\n"+
		"Or the light loss of England for a friend:\n"+
		"Forego the easier.\n"+
		"BLANCH\n"+
		"That's the curse of Rome.\n"+
		"CONSTANCE\n"+
		"O Lewis, stand fast! the devil tempts thee here\n"+
		"In likeness of a new untrimmed bride.\n"+
		"BLANCH\n"+
		"The Lady Constance speaks not from her faith,\n"+
		"But from her need.\n"+
		"CONSTANCE\n"+
		"O, if thou grant my need,\n"+
		"Which only lives but by the death of faith,\n"+
		"That need must needs infer this principle,\n"+
		"That faith would live again by death of need.\n"+
		"O then, tread down my need, and faith mounts up;\n"+
		"Keep my need up, and faith is trodden down!\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"The king is moved, and answers not to this.\n"+
		"CONSTANCE\n"+
		"O, be removed from him, and answer well!\n"+
		"AUSTRIA\n"+
		"Do so, King Philip; hang no more in doubt.\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"Hang nothing but a calf's-skin, most sweet lout.\n"+
		"KING PHILIP\n"+
		"I am perplex'd, and know not what to say.\n"+
		"CARDINAL PANDULPH\n"+
		"What canst thou say but will perplex thee more,\n"+
		"If thou stand excommunicate and cursed?\n"+
		"KING PHILIP\n"+
		"Good reverend father, make my person yours,\n"+
		"And tell me how you would bestow yourself.\n"+
		"This royal hand and mine are newly knit,\n"+
		"And the conjunction of our inward souls\n"+
		"Married in league, coupled and linked together\n"+
		"With all religious strength of sacred vows;\n"+
		"The latest breath that gave the sound of words\n"+
		"Was deep-sworn faith, peace, amity, true love\n"+
		"Between our kingdoms and our royal selves,\n"+
		"And even before this truce, but new before,\n"+
		"No longer than we well could wash our hands\n"+
		"To clap this royal bargain up of peace,\n"+
		"Heaven knows, they were besmear'd and over-stain'd\n"+
		"With slaughter's pencil, where revenge did paint\n"+
		"The fearful difference of incensed kings:\n"+
		"And shall these hands, so lately purged of blood,\n"+
		"So newly join'd in love, so strong in both,\n"+
		"Unyoke this seizure and this kind regreet?\n"+
		"Play fast and loose with faith? so jest with heaven,\n"+
		"Make such unconstant children of ourselves,\n"+
		"As now again to snatch our palm from palm,\n"+
		"Unswear faith sworn, and on the marriage-bed\n"+
		"Of smiling peace to march a bloody host,\n"+
		"And make a riot on the gentle brow\n"+
		"Of true sincerity? O, holy sir,\n"+
		"My reverend father, let it not be so!\n"+
		"Out of your grace, devise, ordain, impose\n"+
		"Some gentle order; and then we shall be blest\n"+
		"To do your pleasure and continue friends.\n"+
		"CARDINAL PANDULPH\n"+
		"All form is formless, order orderless,\n"+
		"Save what is opposite to England's love.\n"+
		"Therefore to arms! be champion of our church,\n"+
		"Or let the church, our mother, breathe her curse,\n"+
		"A mother's curse, on her revolting son.\n"+
		"France, thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue,\n"+
		"A chafed lion by the mortal paw,\n"+
		"A fasting tiger safer by the tooth,\n"+
		"Than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold.\n"+
		"KING PHILIP\n"+
		"I may disjoin my hand, but not my faith.\n"+
		"CARDINAL PANDULPH\n"+
		"So makest thou faith an enemy to faith;\n"+
		"And like a civil war set'st oath to oath,\n"+
		"Thy tongue against thy tongue. O, let thy vow\n"+
		"First made to heaven, first be to heaven perform'd,\n"+
		"That is, to be the champion of our church!\n"+
		"What since thou sworest is sworn against thyself\n"+
		"And may not be performed by thyself,\n"+
		"For that which thou hast sworn to do amiss\n"+
		"Is not amiss when it is truly done,\n"+
		"And being not done, where doing tends to ill,\n"+
		"The truth is then most done not doing it:\n"+
		"The better act of purposes mistook\n"+
		"Is to mistake again; though indirect,\n"+
		"Yet indirection thereby grows direct,\n"+
		"And falsehood falsehood cures, as fire cools fire\n"+
		"Within the scorched veins of one new-burn'd.\n"+
		"It is religion that doth make vows kept;\n"+
		"But thou hast sworn against religion,\n"+
		"By what thou swear'st against the thing thou swear'st,\n"+
		"And makest an oath the surety for thy truth\n"+
		"Against an oath: the truth thou art unsure\n"+
		"To swear, swears only not to be forsworn;\n"+
		"Else what a mockery should it be to swear!\n"+
		"But thou dost swear only to be forsworn;\n"+
		"And most forsworn, to keep what thou dost swear.\n"+
		"Therefore thy later vows against thy first\n"+
		"Is in thyself rebellion to thyself;\n"+
		"And better conquest never canst thou make\n"+
		"Than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts\n"+
		"Against these giddy loose suggestions:\n"+
		"Upon which better part our prayers come in,\n"+
		"If thou vouchsafe them. But if not, then know\n"+
		"The peril of our curses light on thee\n"+
		"So heavy as thou shalt not shake them off,\n"+
		"But in despair die under their black weight.\n"+

		"Do not I know thou wouldst?\n"+
		"Good Hubert, Hubert, Hubert, throw thine eye\n"+
		"On yon young boy: I'll tell thee what, my friend,\n"+
		"He is a very serpent in my way;\n"+
		"And whereso'er this foot of mine doth tread,\n"+
		"He lies before me: dost thou understand me?\n"+
		"Thou art his keeper.\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"And I'll keep him so,\n"+
		"That he shall not offend your majesty.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Death.\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"My lord?\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"A grave.\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"He shall not live.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Enough.\n"+
		"I could be merry now. Hubert, I love thee;\n"+
		"Well, I'll not say what I intend for thee:\n"+
		"Remember. Madam, fare you well:\n"+
		"I'll send those powers o'er to your majesty.\n"+
		"ELINOR\n"+
		"My blessing go with thee!\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"For England, cousin, go:\n"+
		"Hubert shall be your man, attend on you\n"+
		"With all true duty. On toward Calais, ho!\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV. The same. KING PHILIP'S tent.\n"+
		"Enter KING PHILIP, LEWIS, CARDINAL PANDULPH, and Attendants\n"+
		"KING PHILIP\n"+
		"So, by a roaring tempest on the flood,\n"+
		"A whole armado of convicted sail\n"+
		"Is scatter'd and disjoin'd from fellowship.\n"+
		"CARDINAL PANDULPH\n"+
		"Courage and comfort! all shall yet go well.\n"+
		"KING PHILIP\n"+
		"What can go well, when we have run so ill?\n"+
		"Are we not beaten? Is not Angiers lost?\n"+
		"Arthur ta'en prisoner? divers dear friends slain?\n"+
		"And bloody England into England gone,\n"+
		"O'erbearing interruption, spite of France?\n"+
		"LEWIS\n"+
		"What he hath won, that hath he fortified:\n"+
		"So hot a speed with such advice disposed,\n"+
		"Such temperate order in so fierce a cause,\n"+
		"Doth want example: who hath read or heard\n"+
		"Of any kindred action like to this?\n"+
		"KING PHILIP\n"+
		"Well could I bear that England had this praise,\n"+
		"So we could find some pattern of our shame.\n"+
		"Enter CONSTANCE\n"+
		"Look, who comes here! a grave unto a soul;\n"+
		"Holding the eternal spirit against her will,\n"+
		"In the vile prison of afflicted breath.\n"+
		"I prithee, lady, go away with me.\n"+
		"CONSTANCE\n"+
		"Lo, now I now see the issue of your peace.\n"+
		"KING PHILIP\n"+
		"Patience, good lady! comfort, gentle Constance!\n"+
		"CONSTANCE\n"+
		"No, I defy all counsel, all redress,\n"+
		"But that which ends all counsel, true redress,\n"+
		"Death, death; O amiable lovely death!\n"+
		"Thou odouriferous stench! sound rottenness!\n"+
		"Arise forth from the couch of lasting night,\n"+
		"Thou hate and terror to prosperity,\n"+
		"And I will kiss thy detestable bones\n"+
		"And put my eyeballs in thy vaulty brows\n"+
		"And ring these fingers with thy household worms\n"+
		"And stop this gap of breath with fulsome dust\n"+
		"And be a carrion monster like thyself:\n"+
		"Come, grin on me, and I will think thou smilest\n"+
		"And buss thee as thy wife. Misery's love,\n"+
		"O, come to me!\n"+
		"KING PHILIP\n"+
		"O fair affliction, peace!\n"+
		"CONSTANCE\n"+
		"No, no, I will not, having breath to cry:\n"+
		"O, that my tongue were in the thunder's mouth!\n"+
		"Then with a passion would I shake the world;\n"+
		"And rouse from sleep that fell anatomy\n"+
		"Which cannot hear a lady's feeble voice,\n"+
		"Which scorns a modern invocation.\n"+
		"CARDINAL PANDULPH\n"+
		"Lady, you utter madness, and not sorrow.\n"+
		"CONSTANCE\n"+
		"Thou art not holy to belie me so;\n"+
		"I am not mad: this hair I tear is mine;\n"+
		"My name is Constance; I was Geffrey's wife;\n"+
		"Young Arthur is my son, and he is lost:\n"+
		"I am not mad: I would to heaven I were!\n"+
		"For then, 'tis like I should forget myself:\n"+
		"O, if I could, what grief should I forget!\n"+
		"Preach some philosophy to make me mad,\n"+
		"And thou shalt be canonized, cardinal;\n"+
		"For being not mad but sensible of grief,\n"+
		"My reasonable part produces reason\n"+
		"How I may be deliver'd of these woes,\n"+
		"And teaches me to kill or hang myself:\n"+
		"If I were mad, I should forget my son,\n"+
		"Or madly think a babe of clouts were he:\n"+
		"I am not mad; too well, too well I feel\n"+
		"The different plague of each calamity.\n"+
		"KING PHILIP\n"+
		"Bind up those tresses. O, what love I note\n"+
		"In the fair multitude of those her hairs!\n"+
		"Where but by chance a silver drop hath fallen,\n"+
		"Even to that drop ten thousand wiry friends\n"+
		"Do glue themselves in sociable grief,\n"+
		"Like true, inseparable, faithful loves,\n"+
		"Sticking together in calamity.\n"+
		"CONSTANCE\n"+
		"To England, if you will.\n"+
		"KING PHILIP\n"+
		"Bind up your hairs.\n"+
		"CONSTANCE\n"+
		"Yes, that I will; and wherefore will I do it?\n"+
		"I tore them from their bonds and cried aloud\n"+
		"'O that these hands could so redeem my son,\n"+
		"As they have given these hairs their liberty!'\n"+
		"But now I envy at their liberty,\n"+
		"And will again commit them to their bonds,\n"+
		"Because my poor child is a prisoner.\n"+
		"And, father cardinal, I have heard you say\n"+
		"That we shall see and know our friends in heaven:\n"+
		"If that be true, I shall see my boy again;\n"+
		"For since the birth of Cain, the first male child,\n"+
		"To him that did but yesterday suspire,\n"+
		"There was not such a gracious creature born.\n"+
		"But now will canker-sorrow eat my bud\n"+
		"And chase the native beauty from his cheek\n"+
		"And he will look as hollow as a ghost,\n"+
		"As dim and meagre as an ague's fit,\n"+
		"And so he'll die; and, rising so again,\n"+
		"When I shall meet him in the court of heaven\n"+
		"I shall not know him: therefore never, never\n"+
		"Must I behold my pretty Arthur more.\n"+
		"CARDINAL PANDULPH\n"+
		"You hold too heinous a respect of grief.\n"+
		"CONSTANCE\n"+
		"He talks to me that never had a son.\n"+
		"KING PHILIP\n"+
		"You are as fond of grief as of your child.\n"+
		"CONSTANCE\n"+
		"Grief fills the room up of my absent child,\n"+
		"Lies in his bed, walks up and down with me,\n"+
		"Puts on his pretty looks, repeats his words,\n"+
		"Remembers me of all his gracious parts,\n"+
		"Stuffs out his vacant garments with his form;\n"+
		"Then, have I reason to be fond of grief?\n"+
		"Fare you well: had you such a loss as I,\n"+
		"I could give better comfort than you do.\n"+
		"I will not keep this form upon my head,\n"+
		"When there is such disorder in my wit.\n"+
		"O Lord! my boy, my Arthur, my fair son!\n"+
		"My life, my joy, my food, my all the world!\n"+
		"My widow-comfort, and my sorrows' cure!\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"KING PHILIP\n"+
		"I fear some outrage, and I'll follow her.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"LEWIS\n"+
		"There's nothing in this world can make me joy:\n"+
		"Life is as tedious as a twice-told tale\n"+
		"Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man;\n"+
		"And bitter shame hath spoil'd the sweet world's taste\n"+
		"That it yields nought but shame and bitterness.\n"+
		"CARDINAL PANDULPH\n"+
		"Before the curing of a strong disease,\n"+
		"Even in the instant of repair and health,\n"+
		"The fit is strongest; evils that take leave,\n"+
		"On their departure most of all show evil:\n"+
		"What have you lost by losing of this day?\n"+
		"LEWIS\n"+
		"All days of glory, joy and happiness.\n"+
		"CARDINAL PANDULPH\n"+
		"If you had won it, certainly you had.\n"+
		"No, no; when Fortune means to men most good,\n"+
		"She looks upon them with a threatening eye.\n"+
		"'Tis strange to think how much King John hath lost\n"+
		"In this which he accounts so clearly won:\n"+
		"Are not you grieved that Arthur is his prisoner?\n"+
		"LEWIS\n"+
		"As heartily as he is glad he hath him.\n"+
		"CARDINAL PANDULPH\n"+
		"Your mind is all as youthful as your blood.\n"+
		"Now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit;\n"+
		"For even the breath of what I mean to speak\n"+
		"Shall blow each dust, each straw, each little rub,\n"+
		"Out of the path which shall directly lead\n"+
		"Thy foot to England's throne; and therefore mark.\n"+
		"John hath seized Arthur; and it cannot be\n"+
		"That, whiles warm life plays in that infant's veins,\n"+
		"The misplaced John should entertain an hour,\n"+
		"One minute, nay, one quiet breath of rest.\n"+
		"A sceptre snatch'd with an unruly hand\n"+
		"Must be as boisterously maintain'd as gain'd;\n"+
		"And he that stands upon a slippery place\n"+
		"Makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up:\n"+
		"That John may stand, then Arthur needs must fall;\n"+
		"So be it, for it cannot be but so.\n"+
		"LEWIS\n"+
		"But what shall I gain by young Arthur's fall?\n"+
		"CARDINAL PANDULPH\n"+
		"You, in the right of Lady Blanch your wife,\n"+
		"May then make all the claim that Arthur did.\n"+
		"LEWIS\n"+
		"And lose it, life and all, as Arthur did.\n"+
		"CARDINAL PANDULPH\n"+
		"How green you are and fresh in this old world!\n"+
		"John lays you plots; the times conspire with you;\n"+
		"For he that steeps his safety in true blood\n"+
		"Shall find but bloody safety and untrue.\n"+
		"This act so evilly born shall cool the hearts\n"+
		"Of all his people and freeze up their zeal,\n"+
		"That none so small advantage shall step forth\n"+
		"To cheque his reign, but they will cherish it;\n"+
		"No natural exhalation in the sky,\n"+
		"No scope of nature, no distemper'd day,\n"+
		"No common wind, no customed event,\n"+
		"But they will pluck away his natural cause\n"+
		"And call them meteors, prodigies and signs,\n"+
		"Abortives, presages and tongues of heaven,\n"+
		"Plainly denouncing vengeance upon John.\n"+
		"LEWIS\n"+
		"May be he will not touch young Arthur's life,\n"+
		"But hold himself safe in his prisonment.\n"+
		"CARDINAL PANDULPH\n"+
		"O, sir, when he shall hear of your approach,\n"+
		"If that young Arthur be not gone already,\n"+
		"Even at that news he dies; and then the hearts\n"+
		"Of all his people shall revolt from him\n"+
		"And kiss the lips of unacquainted change\n"+
		"And pick strong matter of revolt and wrath\n"+
		"Out of the bloody fingers' ends of John.\n"+
		"Methinks I see this hurly all on foot:\n"+
		"And, O, what better matter breeds for you\n"+
		"Than I have named! The bastard Faulconbridge\n"+
		"Is now in England, ransacking the church,\n"+
		"Offending charity: if but a dozen French\n"+
		"Were there in arms, they would be as a call\n"+
		"To train ten thousand English to their side,\n"+
		"Or as a little snow, tumbled about,\n"+
		"Anon becomes a mountain. O noble Dauphin,\n"+
		"Go with me to the king: 'tis wonderful\n"+
		"What may be wrought out of their discontent,\n"+
		"Now that their souls are topful of offence.\n"+
		"For England go: I will whet on the king.\n"+
		"LEWIS\n"+
		"Strong reasons make strong actions: let us go:\n"+
		"If you say ay, the king will not say no.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT IV\n"+
		"SCENE I. A room in a castle.\n"+
		"Enter HUBERT and Executioners\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"Heat me these irons hot; and look thou stand\n"+
		"Within the arras: when I strike my foot\n"+
		"Upon the bosom of the ground, rush forth,\n"+
		"And bind the boy which you shall find with me\n"+
		"Fast to the chair: be heedful: hence, and watch.\n"+
		"First Executioner\n"+
		"I hope your warrant will bear out the deed.\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"Uncleanly scruples! fear not you: look to't.\n"+
		"Exeunt Executioners\n"+
		"Young lad, come forth; I have to say with you.\n"+
		"Enter ARTHUR\n"+
		"ARTHUR\n"+
		"Good morrow, Hubert.\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"Good morrow, little prince.\n"+
		"ARTHUR\n"+
		"As little prince, having so great a title\n"+
		"To be more prince, as may be. You are sad.\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"Indeed, I have been merrier.\n"+
		"ARTHUR\n"+
		"Mercy on me!\n"+
		"Methinks no body should be sad but I:\n"+
		"Yet, I remember, when I was in France,\n"+
		"Young gentlemen would be as sad as night,\n"+
		"Only for wantonness. By my christendom,\n"+
		"So I were out of prison and kept sheep,\n"+
		"I should be as merry as the day is long;\n"+
		"And so I would be here, but that I doubt\n"+
		"My uncle practises more harm to me:\n"+
		"He is afraid of me and I of him:\n"+
		"Is it my fault that I was Geffrey's son?\n"+
		"No, indeed, is't not; and I would to heaven\n"+
		"I were your son, so you would love me, Hubert.\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"[Aside] If I talk to him, with his innocent prate\n"+
		"He will awake my mercy which lies dead:\n"+
		"Therefore I will be sudden and dispatch.\n"+
		"ARTHUR\n"+
		"Are you sick, Hubert? you look pale to-day:\n"+
		"In sooth, I would you were a little sick,\n"+
		"That I might sit all night and watch with you:\n"+
		"I warrant I love you more than you do me.\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"[Aside] His words do take possession of my bosom.\n"+
		"Read here, young Arthur.\n"+
		"Showing a paper\n"+
		"Aside\n"+
		"How now, foolish rheum!\n"+
		"Turning dispiteous torture out of door!\n"+
		"I must be brief, lest resolution drop\n"+
		"Out at mine eyes in tender womanish tears.\n"+
		"Can you not read it? Is it not fair writ?\n"+
		"ARTHUR\n"+
		"Too fairly, Hubert, for so foul effect:\n"+
		"Must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes?\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"Young boy, I must.\n"+
		"ARTHUR\n"+
		"And will you?\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"And I will.\n"+
		"ARTHUR\n"+
		"Have you the heart? When your head did but ache,\n"+
		"I knit my handercher about your brows,\n"+
		"The best I had, a princess wrought it me,\n"+
		"And I did never ask it you again;\n"+
		"And with my hand at midnight held your head,\n"+
		"And like the watchful minutes to the hour,\n"+
		"Still and anon cheer'd up the heavy time,\n"+
		"Saying, 'What lack you?' and 'Where lies your grief?'\n"+
		"Or 'What good love may I perform for you?'\n"+
		"Many a poor man's son would have lien still\n"+
		"And ne'er have spoke a loving word to you;\n"+
		"But you at your sick service had a prince.\n"+
		"Nay, you may think my love was crafty love\n"+
		"And call it cunning: do, an if you will:\n"+
		"If heaven be pleased that you must use me ill,\n"+
		"Why then you must. Will you put out mine eyes?\n"+
		"These eyes that never did nor never shall\n"+
		"So much as frown on you.\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"I have sworn to do it;\n"+
		"And with hot irons must I burn them out.\n"+
		"ARTHUR\n"+
		"Ah, none but in this iron age would do it!\n"+
		"The iron of itself, though heat red-hot,\n"+
		"Approaching near these eyes, would drink my tears\n"+
		"And quench his fiery indignation\n"+
		"Even in the matter of mine innocence;\n"+
		"Nay, after that, consume away in rust\n"+
		"But for containing fire to harm mine eye.\n"+
		"Are you more stubborn-hard than hammer'd iron?\n"+
		"An if an angel should have come to me\n"+
		"And told me Hubert should put out mine eyes,\n"+
		"I would not have believed him,--no tongue but Hubert's.\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"Come forth.\n"+
		"Stamps\n"+
		"Re-enter Executioners, with a cord, irons, & c\n"+
		"Do as I bid you do.\n"+
		"ARTHUR\n"+
		"O, save me, Hubert, save me! my eyes are out\n"+
		"Even with the fierce looks of these bloody men.\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"Give me the iron, I say, and bind him here.\n"+
		"ARTHUR\n"+
		"Alas, what need you be so boisterous-rough?\n"+
		"I will not struggle, I will stand stone-still.\n"+
		"For heaven sake, Hubert, let me not be bound!\n"+
		"Nay, hear me, Hubert, drive these men away,\n"+
		"And I will sit as quiet as a lamb;\n"+
		"I will not stir, nor wince, nor speak a word,\n"+
		"Nor look upon the iron angerly:\n"+
		"Thrust but these men away, and I'll forgive you,\n"+
		"Whatever torment you do put me to.\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"Go, stand within; let me alone with him.\n"+
		"First Executioner\n"+
		"I am best pleased to be from such a deed.\n"+
		"Exeunt Executioners\n"+
		"ARTHUR\n"+
		"Alas, I then have chid away my friend!\n"+
		"He hath a stern look, but a gentle heart:\n"+
		"Let him come back, that his compassion may\n"+
		"Give life to yours.\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"Come, boy, prepare yourself.\n"+
		"ARTHUR\n"+
		"Is there no remedy?\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"None, but to lose your eyes.\n"+
		"ARTHUR\n"+
		"O heaven, that there were but a mote in yours,\n"+
		"A grain, a dust, a gnat, a wandering hair,\n"+
		"Any annoyance in that precious sense!\n"+
		"Then feeling what small things are boisterous there,\n"+
		"Your vile intent must needs seem horrible.\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"Is this your promise? go to, hold your tongue.\n"+
		"ARTHUR\n"+
		"Hubert, the utterance of a brace of tongues\n"+
		"Must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes:\n"+
		"Let me not hold my tongue, let me not, Hubert;\n"+
		"Or, Hubert, if you will, cut out my tongue,\n"+
		"So I may keep mine eyes: O, spare mine eyes.\n"+
		"Though to no use but still to look on you!\n"+
		"Lo, by my truth, the instrument is cold\n"+
		"And would not harm me.\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"I can heat it, boy.\n"+
		"ARTHUR\n"+
		"No, in good sooth: the fire is dead with grief,\n"+
		"Being create for comfort, to be used\n"+
		"In undeserved extremes: see else yourself;\n"+
		"There is no malice in this burning coal;\n"+
		"The breath of heaven has blown his spirit out\n"+
		"And strew'd repentent ashes on his head.\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"But with my breath I can revive it, boy.\n"+
		"ARTHUR\n"+
		"An if you do, you will but make it blush\n"+
		"And glow with shame of your proceedings, Hubert:\n"+
		"Nay, it perchance will sparkle in your eyes;\n"+
		"And like a dog that is compell'd to fight,\n"+
		"Snatch at his master that doth tarre him on.\n"+
		"All things that you should use to do me wrong\n"+
		"Deny their office: only you do lack\n"+
		"That mercy which fierce fire and iron extends,\n"+
		"Creatures of note for mercy-lacking uses.\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"Well, see to live; I will not touch thine eye\n"+
		"For all the treasure that thine uncle owes:\n"+
		"Yet am I sworn and I did purpose, boy,\n"+
		"With this same very iron to burn them out.\n"+
		"ARTHUR\n"+
		"O, now you look like Hubert! all this while\n"+
		"You were disguised.\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"Peace; no more. Adieu.\n"+
		"Your uncle must not know but you are dead;\n"+
		"I'll fill these dogged spies with false reports:\n"+
		"And, pretty child, sleep doubtless and secure,\n"+
		"That Hubert, for the wealth of all the world,\n"+
		"Will not offend thee.\n"+
		"ARTHUR\n"+
		"O heaven! I thank you, Hubert.\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"Silence; no more: go closely in with me:\n"+
		"Much danger do I undergo for thee.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. KING JOHN'S palace.\n"+
		"Enter KING JOHN, PEMBROKE, SALISBURY, and other Lords\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Here once again we sit, once again crown'd,\n"+
		"And looked upon, I hope, with cheerful eyes.\n"+
		"PEMBROKE\n"+
		"This 'once again,' but that your highness pleased,\n"+
		"Was once superfluous: you were crown'd before,\n"+
		"And that high royalty was ne'er pluck'd off,\n"+
		"The faiths of men ne'er stained with revolt;\n"+
		"Fresh expectation troubled not the land\n"+
		"With any long'd-for change or better state.\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"Therefore, to be possess'd with double pomp,\n"+
		"To guard a title that was rich before,\n"+
		"To gild refined gold, to paint the lily,\n"+
		"To throw a perfume on the violet,\n"+
		"To smooth the ice, or add another hue\n"+
		"Unto the rainbow, or with taper-light\n"+
		"To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,\n"+
		"Is wasteful and ridiculous excess.\n"+
		"PEMBROKE\n"+
		"But that your royal pleasure must be done,\n"+
		"This act is as an ancient tale new told,\n"+
		"And in the last repeating troublesome,\n"+
		"Being urged at a time unseasonable.\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"In this the antique and well noted face\n"+
		"Of plain old form is much disfigured;\n"+
		"And, like a shifted wind unto a sail,\n"+
		"It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about,\n"+
		"Startles and frights consideration,\n"+
		"Makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected,\n"+
		"For putting on so new a fashion'd robe.\n"+
		"PEMBROKE\n"+
		"When workmen strive to do better than well,\n"+
		"They do confound their skill in covetousness;\n"+
		"And oftentimes excusing of a fault\n"+
		"Doth make the fault the worse by the excuse,\n"+
		"As patches set upon a little breach\n"+
		"Discredit more in hiding of the fault\n"+
		"Than did the fault before it was so patch'd.\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"To this effect, before you were new crown'd,\n"+
		"We breathed our counsel: but it pleased your highness\n"+
		"To overbear it, and we are all well pleased,\n"+
		"Since all and every part of what we would\n"+
		"Doth make a stand at what your highness will.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Some reasons of this double coronation\n"+
		"I have possess'd you with and think them strong;\n"+
		"And more, more strong, then lesser is my fear,\n"+
		"I shall indue you with: meantime but ask\n"+
		"What you would have reform'd that is not well,\n"+
		"And well shall you perceive how willingly\n"+
		"I will both hear and grant you your requests.\n"+
		"PEMBROKE\n"+
		"Then I, as one that am the tongue of these,\n"+
		"To sound the purpose of all their hearts,\n"+
		"Both for myself and them, but, chief of all,\n"+
		"Your safety, for the which myself and them\n"+
		"Bend their best studies, heartily request\n"+
		"The enfranchisement of Arthur; whose restraint\n"+
		"Doth move the murmuring lips of discontent\n"+
		"To break into this dangerous argument,--\n"+
		"If what in rest you have in right you hold,\n"+
		"Why then your fears, which, as they say, attend\n"+
		"The steps of wrong, should move you to mew up\n"+
		"Your tender kinsman and to choke his days\n"+
		"With barbarous ignorance and deny his youth\n"+
		"The rich advantage of good exercise?\n"+
		"That the time's enemies may not have this\n"+
		"To grace occasions, let it be our suit\n"+
		"That you have bid us ask his liberty;\n"+
		"Which for our goods we do no further ask\n"+
		"Than whereupon our weal, on you depending,\n"+
		"Counts it your weal he have his liberty.\n"+
		"Enter HUBERT\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Let it be so: I do commit his youth\n"+
		"To your direction. Hubert, what news with you?\n"+
		"Taking him apart\n"+
		"PEMBROKE\n"+
		"This is the man should do the bloody deed;\n"+
		"He show'd his warrant to a friend of mine:\n"+
		"The image of a wicked heinous fault\n"+
		"Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his\n"+
		"Does show the mood of a much troubled breast;\n"+
		"And I do fearfully believe 'tis done,\n"+
		"What we so fear'd he had a charge to do.\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"The colour of the king doth come and go\n"+
		"Between his purpose and his conscience,\n"+
		"Like heralds 'twixt two dreadful battles set:\n"+
		"His passion is so ripe, it needs must break.\n"+
		"PEMBROKE\n"+
		"And when it breaks, I fear will issue thence\n"+
		"The foul corruption of a sweet child's death.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"We cannot hold mortality's strong hand:\n"+
		"Good lords, although my will to give is living,\n"+
		"The suit which you demand is gone and dead:\n"+
		"He tells us Arthur is deceased to-night.\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"Indeed we fear'd his sickness was past cure.\n"+
		"PEMBROKE\n"+
		"Indeed we heard how near his death he was\n"+
		"Before the child himself felt he was sick:\n"+
		"This must be answer'd either here or hence.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Why do you bend such solemn brows on me?\n"+
		"Think you I bear the shears of destiny?\n"+
		"Have I commandment on the pulse of life?\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"It is apparent foul play; and 'tis shame\n"+
		"That greatness should so grossly offer it:\n"+
		"So thrive it in your game! and so, farewell.\n"+
		"PEMBROKE\n"+
		"Stay yet, Lord Salisbury; I'll go with thee,\n"+
		"And find the inheritance of this poor child,\n"+
		"His little kingdom of a forced grave.\n"+
		"That blood which owed the breadth of all this isle,\n"+
		"Three foot of it doth hold: bad world the while!\n"+
		"This must not be thus borne: this will break out\n"+
		"To all our sorrows, and ere long I doubt.\n"+
		"Exeunt Lords\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"They burn in indignation. I repent:\n"+
		"There is no sure foundation set on blood,\n"+
		"No certain life achieved by others' death.\n"+
		"Enter a Messenger\n"+
		"A fearful eye thou hast: where is that blood\n"+
		"That I have seen inhabit in those cheeks?\n"+
		"So foul a sky clears not without a storm:\n"+
		"Pour down thy weather: how goes all in France?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"From France to England. Never such a power\n"+
		"For any foreign preparation\n"+
		"Was levied in the body of a land.\n"+
		"The copy of your speed is learn'd by them;\n"+
		"For when you should be told they do prepare,\n"+
		"The tidings come that they are all arrived.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"O, where hath our intelligence been drunk?\n"+
		"Where hath it slept? Where is my mother's care,\n"+
		"That such an army could be drawn in France,\n"+
		"And she not hear of it?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"My liege, her ear\n"+
		"Is stopp'd with dust; the first of April died\n"+
		"Your noble mother: and, as I hear, my lord,\n"+
		"The Lady Constance in a frenzy died\n"+
		"Three days before: but this from rumour's tongue\n"+
		"I idly heard; if true or false I know not.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Withhold thy speed, dreadful occasion!\n"+
		"O, make a league with me, till I have pleased\n"+
		"My discontented peers! What! mother dead!\n"+
		"How wildly then walks my estate in France!\n"+
		"Under whose conduct came those powers of France\n"+
		"That thou for truth givest out are landed here?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Under the Dauphin.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Thou hast made me giddy\n"+
		"With these ill tidings.\n"+
		"Enter the BASTARD and PETER of Pomfret\n"+
		"Now, what says the world\n"+
		"To your proceedings? do not seek to stuff\n"+
		"My head with more ill news, for it is full.\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"But if you be afeard to hear the worst,\n"+
		"Then let the worst unheard fall on your bead.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Bear with me cousin, for I was amazed\n"+
		"Under the tide: but now I breathe again\n"+
		"Aloft the flood, and can give audience\n"+
		"To any tongue, speak it of what it will.\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"How I have sped among the clergymen,\n"+
		"The sums I have collected shall express.\n"+
		"But as I travell'd hither through the land,\n"+
		"I find the people strangely fantasied;\n"+
		"Possess'd with rumours, full of idle dreams,\n"+
		"Not knowing what they fear, but full of fear:\n"+
		"And here a prophet, that I brought with me\n"+
		"From forth the streets of Pomfret, whom I found\n"+
		"With many hundreds treading on his heels;\n"+
		"To whom he sung, in rude harsh-sounding rhymes,\n"+
		"That, ere the next Ascension-day at noon,\n"+
		"Your highness should deliver up your crown.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Thou idle dreamer, wherefore didst thou so?\n"+
		"PETER\n"+
		"Foreknowing that the truth will fall out so.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Hubert, away with him; imprison him;\n"+
		"And on that day at noon whereon he says\n"+
		"I shall yield up my crown, let him be hang'd.\n"+
		"Deliver him to safety; and return,\n"+
		"For I must use thee.\n"+
		"Exeunt HUBERT with PETER\n"+
		"O my gentle cousin,\n"+
		"Hear'st thou the news abroad, who are arrived?\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"The French, my lord; men's mouths are full of it:\n"+
		"Besides, I met Lord Bigot and Lord Salisbury,\n"+
		"With eyes as red as new-enkindled fire,\n"+
		"And others more, going to seek the grave\n"+
		"Of Arthur, who they say is kill'd to-night\n"+
		"On your suggestion.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Gentle kinsman, go,\n"+
		"And thrust thyself into their companies:\n"+
		"I have a way to win their loves again;\n"+
		"Bring them before me.\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"I will seek them out.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Nay, but make haste; the better foot before.\n"+
		"O, let me have no subject enemies,\n"+
		"When adverse foreigners affright my towns\n"+
		"With dreadful pomp of stout invasion!\n"+
		"Be Mercury, set feathers to thy heels,\n"+
		"And fly like thought from them to me again.\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"The spirit of the time shall teach me speed.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman.\n"+
		"Go after him; for he perhaps shall need\n"+
		"Some messenger betwixt me and the peers;\n"+
		"And be thou he.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"With all my heart, my liege.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"My mother dead!\n"+
		"Re-enter HUBERT\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"My lord, they say five moons were seen to-night;\n"+
		"Four fixed, and the fifth did whirl about\n"+
		"The other four in wondrous motion.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Five moons!\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"Old men and beldams in the streets\n"+
		"Do prophesy upon it dangerously:\n"+
		"Young Arthur's death is common in their mouths:\n"+
		"And when they talk of him, they shake their heads\n"+
		"And whisper one another in the ear;\n"+
		"And he that speaks doth gripe the hearer's wrist,\n"+
		"Whilst he that hears makes fearful action,\n"+
		"With wrinkled brows, with nods, with rolling eyes.\n"+
		"I saw a smith stand with his hammer, thus,\n"+
		"The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool,\n"+
		"With open mouth swallowing a tailor's news;\n"+
		"Who, with his shears and measure in his hand,\n"+
		"Standing on slippers, which his nimble haste\n"+
		"Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet,\n"+
		"Told of a many thousand warlike French\n"+
		"That were embattailed and rank'd in Kent:\n"+
		"Another lean unwash'd artificer\n"+
		"Cuts off his tale and talks of Arthur's death.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Why seek'st thou to possess me with these fears?\n"+
		"Why urgest thou so oft young Arthur's death?\n"+
		"Thy hand hath murder'd him: I had a mighty cause\n"+
		"To wish him dead, but thou hadst none to kill him.\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"No had, my lord! why, did you not provoke me?\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"It is the curse of kings to be attended\n"+
		"By slaves that take their humours for a warrant\n"+
		"To break within the bloody house of life,\n"+
		"And on the winking of authority\n"+
		"To understand a law, to know the meaning\n"+
		"Of dangerous majesty, when perchance it frowns\n"+
		"More upon humour than advised respect.\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"Here is your hand and seal for what I did.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"O, when the last account 'twixt heaven and earth\n"+
		"Is to be made, then shall this hand and seal\n"+
		"Witness against us to damnation!\n"+
		"How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds\n"+
		"Make deeds ill done! Hadst not thou been by,\n"+
		"A fellow by the hand of nature mark'd,\n"+
		"Quoted and sign'd to do a deed of shame,\n"+
		"This murder had not come into my mind:\n"+
		"But taking note of thy abhorr'd aspect,\n"+
		"Finding thee fit for bloody villany,\n"+
		"Apt, liable to be employ'd in danger,\n"+
		"I faintly broke with thee of Arthur's death;\n"+
		"And thou, to be endeared to a king,\n"+
		"Made it no conscience to destroy a prince.\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"My lord--\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause\n"+
		"When I spake darkly what I purposed,\n"+
		"Or turn'd an eye of doubt upon my face,\n"+
		"As bid me tell my tale in express words,\n"+
		"Deep shame had struck me dumb, made me break off,\n"+
		"And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me:\n"+
		"But thou didst understand me by my signs\n"+
		"And didst in signs again parley with sin;\n"+
		"Yea, without stop, didst let thy heart consent,\n"+
		"And consequently thy rude hand to act\n"+
		"The deed, which both our tongues held vile to name.\n"+
		"Out of my sight, and never see me more!\n"+
		"My nobles leave me; and my state is braved,\n"+
		"Even at my gates, with ranks of foreign powers:\n"+
		"Nay, in the body of this fleshly land,\n"+
		"This kingdom, this confine of blood and breath,\n"+
		"Hostility and civil tumult reigns\n"+
		"Between my conscience and my cousin's death.\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"Arm you against your other enemies,\n"+
		"I'll make a peace between your soul and you.\n"+
		"Young Arthur is alive: this hand of mine\n"+
		"Is yet a maiden and an innocent hand,\n"+
		"Not painted with the crimson spots of blood.\n"+
		"Within this bosom never enter'd yet\n"+
		"The dreadful motion of a murderous thought;\n"+
		"And you have slander'd nature in my form,\n"+
		"Which, howsoever rude exteriorly,\n"+
		"Is yet the cover of a fairer mind\n"+
		"Than to be butcher of an innocent child.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Doth Arthur live? O, haste thee to the peers,\n"+
		"Throw this report on their incensed rage,\n"+
		"And make them tame to their obedience!\n"+
		"Forgive the comment that my passion made\n"+
		"Upon thy feature; for my rage was blind,\n"+
		"And foul imaginary eyes of blood\n"+
		"Presented thee more hideous than thou art.\n"+
		"O, answer not, but to my closet bring\n"+
		"The angry lords with all expedient haste.\n"+
		"I conjure thee but slowly; run more fast.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. Before the castle.\n"+
		"Enter ARTHUR, on the walls\n"+
		"ARTHUR\n"+
		"The wall is high, and yet will I leap down:\n"+
		"Good ground, be pitiful and hurt me not!\n"+
		"There's few or none do know me: if they did,\n"+
		"This ship-boy's semblance hath disguised me quite.\n"+
		"I am afraid; and yet I'll venture it.\n"+
		"If I get down, and do not break my limbs,\n"+
		"I'll find a thousand shifts to get away:\n"+
		"As good to die and go, as die and stay.\n"+
		"Leaps down\n"+
		"O me! my uncle's spirit is in these stones:\n"+
		"Heaven take my soul, and England keep my bones!\n"+
		"Dies\n"+
		"Enter PEMBROKE, SALISBURY, and BIGOT\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"Lords, I will meet him at Saint Edmundsbury:\n"+
		"It is our safety, and we must embrace\n"+
		"This gentle offer of the perilous time.\n"+
		"PEMBROKE\n"+
		"Who brought that letter from the cardinal?\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"The Count Melun, a noble lord of France,\n"+
		"Whose private with me of the Dauphin's love\n"+
		"Is much more general than these lines import.\n"+
		"BIGOT\n"+
		"To-morrow morning let us meet him then.\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"Or rather then set forward; for 'twill be\n"+
		"Two long days' journey, lords, or ere we meet.\n"+
		"Enter the BASTARD\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"Once more to-day well met, distemper'd lords!\n"+
		"The king by me requests your presence straight.\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"The king hath dispossess'd himself of us:\n"+
		"We will not line his thin bestained cloak\n"+
		"With our pure honours, nor attend the foot\n"+
		"That leaves the print of blood where'er it walks.\n"+
		"Return and tell him so: we know the worst.\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"Whate'er you think, good words, I think, were best.\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"Our griefs, and not our manners, reason now.\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"But there is little reason in your grief;\n"+
		"Therefore 'twere reason you had manners now.\n"+
		"PEMBROKE\n"+
		"Sir, sir, impatience hath his privilege.\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"'Tis true, to hurt his master, no man else.\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"This is the prison. What is he lies here?\n"+
		"Seeing ARTHUR\n"+
		"PEMBROKE\n"+
		"O death, made proud with pure and princely beauty!\n"+
		"The earth had not a hole to hide this deed.\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"Murder, as hating what himself hath done,\n"+
		"Doth lay it open to urge on revenge.\n"+
		"BIGOT\n"+
		"Or, when he doom'd this beauty to a grave,\n"+
		"Found it too precious-princely for a grave.\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"Sir Richard, what think you? have you beheld,\n"+
		"Or have you read or heard? or could you think?\n"+
		"Or do you almost think, although you see,\n"+
		"That you do see? could thought, without this object,\n"+
		"Form such another? This is the very top,\n"+
		"The height, the crest, or crest unto the crest,\n"+
		"Of murder's arms: this is the bloodiest shame,\n"+
		"The wildest savagery, the vilest stroke,\n"+
		"That ever wall-eyed wrath or staring rage\n"+
		"Presented to the tears of soft remorse.\n"+
		"PEMBROKE\n"+
		"All murders past do stand excused in this:\n"+
		"And this, so sole and so unmatchable,\n"+
		"Shall give a holiness, a purity,\n"+
		"To the yet unbegotten sin of times;\n"+
		"And prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest,\n"+
		"Exampled by this heinous spectacle.\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"It is a damned and a bloody work;\n"+
		"The graceless action of a heavy hand,\n"+
		"If that it be the work of any hand.\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"If that it be the work of any hand!\n"+
		"We had a kind of light what would ensue:\n"+
		"It is the shameful work of Hubert's hand;\n"+
		"The practise and the purpose of the king:\n"+
		"From whose obedience I forbid my soul,\n"+
		"Kneeling before this ruin of sweet life,\n"+
		"And breathing to his breathless excellence\n"+
		"The incense of a vow, a holy vow,\n"+
		"Never to taste the pleasures of the world,\n"+
		"Never to be infected with delight,\n"+
		"Nor conversant with ease and idleness,\n"+
		"Till I have set a glory to this hand,\n"+
		"By giving it the worship of revenge.\n"+
		"PEMBROKE\n"+
		"BIGOT\n"+
		"Our souls religiously confirm thy words.\n"+
		"Enter HUBERT\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"Lords, I am hot with haste in seeking you:\n"+
		"Arthur doth live; the king hath sent for you.\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"O, he is old and blushes not at death.\n"+
		"Avaunt, thou hateful villain, get thee gone!\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"I am no villain.\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"Must I rob the law?\n"+
		"Drawing his sword\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"Your sword is bright, sir; put it up again.\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"Not till I sheathe it in a murderer's skin.\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"Stand back, Lord Salisbury, stand back, I say;\n"+
		"By heaven, I think my sword's as sharp as yours:\n"+
		"I would not have you, lord, forget yourself,\n"+
		"Nor tempt the danger of my true defence;\n"+
		"Lest I, by marking of your rage, forget\n"+
		"Your worth, your greatness and nobility.\n"+
		"BIGOT\n"+
		"Out, dunghill! darest thou brave a nobleman?\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"Not for my life: but yet I dare defend\n"+
		"My innocent life against an emperor.\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"Thou art a murderer.\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"Do not prove me so;\n"+
		"Yet I am none: whose tongue soe'er speaks false,\n"+
		"Not truly speaks; who speaks not truly, lies.\n"+
		"PEMBROKE\n"+
		"Cut him to pieces.\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"Keep the peace, I say.\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"Stand by, or I shall gall you, Faulconbridge.\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"Thou wert better gall the devil, Salisbury:\n"+
		"If thou but frown on me, or stir thy foot,\n"+
		"Or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame,\n"+
		"I'll strike thee dead. Put up thy sword betime;\n"+
		"Or I'll so maul you and your toasting-iron,\n"+
		"That you shall think the devil is come from hell.\n"+
		"BIGOT\n"+
		"What wilt thou do, renowned Faulconbridge?\n"+
		"Second a villain and a murderer?\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"Lord Bigot, I am none.\n"+
		"BIGOT\n"+
		"Who kill'd this prince?\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"'Tis not an hour since I left him well:\n"+
		"I honour'd him, I loved him, and will weep\n"+
		"My date of life out for his sweet life's loss.\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"Trust not those cunning waters of his eyes,\n"+
		"For villany is not without such rheum;\n"+
		"And he, long traded in it, makes it seem\n"+
		"Like rivers of remorse and innocency.\n"+
		"Away with me, all you whose souls abhor\n"+
		"The uncleanly savours of a slaughter-house;\n"+
		"For I am stifled with this smell of sin.\n"+
		"BIGOT\n"+
		"Away toward Bury, to the Dauphin there!\n"+
		"PEMBROKE\n"+
		"There tell the king he may inquire us out.\n"+
		"Exeunt Lords\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"Here's a good world! Knew you of this fair work?\n"+
		"Beyond the infinite and boundless reach\n"+
		"Of mercy, if thou didst this deed of death,\n"+
		"Art thou damn'd, Hubert.\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"Do but hear me, sir.\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"Ha! I'll tell thee what;\n"+
		"Thou'rt damn'd as black--nay, nothing is so black;\n"+
		"Thou art more deep damn'd than Prince Lucifer:\n"+
		"There is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell\n"+
		"As thou shalt be, if thou didst kill this child.\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"Upon my soul--\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"If thou didst but consent\n"+
		"To this most cruel act, do but despair;\n"+
		"And if thou want'st a cord, the smallest thread\n"+
		"That ever spider twisted from her womb\n"+
		"Will serve to strangle thee, a rush will be a beam\n"+
		"To hang thee on; or wouldst thou drown thyself,\n"+
		"Put but a little water in a spoon,\n"+
		"And it shall be as all the ocean,\n"+
		"Enough to stifle such a villain up.\n"+
		"I do suspect thee very grievously.\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"If I in act, consent, or sin of thought,\n"+
		"Be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath\n"+
		"Which was embounded in this beauteous clay,\n"+
		"Let hell want pains enough to torture me.\n"+
		"I left him well.\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"Go, bear him in thine arms.\n"+
		"I am amazed, methinks, and lose my way\n"+
		"Among the thorns and dangers of this world.\n"+
		"How easy dost thou take all England up!\n"+
		"From forth this morsel of dead royalty,\n"+
		"The life, the right and truth of all this realm\n"+
		"Is fled to heaven; and England now is left\n"+
		"To tug and scamble and to part by the teeth\n"+
		"The unowed interest of proud-swelling state.\n"+
		"Now for the bare-pick'd bone of majesty\n"+
		"Doth dogged war bristle his angry crest\n"+
		"And snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace:\n"+
		"Now powers from home and discontents at home\n"+
		"Meet in one line; and vast confusion waits,\n"+
		"As doth a raven on a sick-fall'n beast,\n"+
		"The imminent decay of wrested pomp.\n"+
		"Now happy he whose cloak and cincture can\n"+
		"Hold out this tempest. Bear away that child\n"+
		"And follow me with speed: I'll to the king:\n"+
		"A thousand businesses are brief in hand,\n"+
		"And heaven itself doth frown upon the land.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT V\n"+
		"SCENE I. KING JOHN'S palace.\n"+
		"Enter KING JOHN, CARDINAL PANDULPH, and Attendants\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Thus have I yielded up into your hand\n"+
		"The circle of my glory.\n"+
		"Giving the crown\n"+
		"CARDINAL PANDULPH\n"+
		"Take again\n"+
		"From this my hand, as holding of the pope\n"+
		"Your sovereign greatness and authority.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Now keep your holy word: go meet the French,\n"+
		"And from his holiness use all your power\n"+
		"To stop their marches 'fore we are inflamed.\n"+
		"Our discontented counties do revolt;\n"+
		"Our people quarrel with obedience,\n"+
		"Swearing allegiance and the love of soul\n"+
		"To stranger blood, to foreign royalty.\n"+
		"This inundation of mistemper'd humour\n"+
		"Rests by you only to be qualified:\n"+
		"Then pause not; for the present time's so sick,\n"+
		"That present medicine must be minister'd,\n"+
		"Or overthrow incurable ensues.\n"+
		"CARDINAL PANDULPH\n"+
		"It was my breath that blew this tempest up,\n"+
		"Upon your stubborn usage of the pope;\n"+
		"But since you are a gentle convertite,\n"+
		"My tongue shall hush again this storm of war\n"+
		"And make fair weather in your blustering land.\n"+
		"On this Ascension-day, remember well,\n"+
		"Upon your oath of service to the pope,\n"+
		"Go I to make the French lay down their arms.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Is this Ascension-day? Did not the prophet\n"+
		"Say that before Ascension-day at noon\n"+
		"My crown I should give off? Even so I have:\n"+
		"I did suppose it should be on constraint:\n"+
		"But, heaven be thank'd, it is but voluntary.\n"+
		"Enter the BASTARD\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"All Kent hath yielded; nothing there holds out\n"+
		"But Dover castle: London hath received,\n"+
		"Like a kind host, the Dauphin and his powers:\n"+
		"Your nobles will not hear you, but are gone\n"+
		"To offer service to your enemy,\n"+
		"And wild amazement hurries up and down\n"+
		"The little number of your doubtful friends.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Would not my lords return to me again,\n"+
		"After they heard young Arthur was alive?\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"They found him dead and cast into the streets,\n"+
		"An empty casket, where the jewel of life\n"+
		"By some damn'd hand was robb'd and ta'en away.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"That villain Hubert told me he did live.\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"So, on my soul, he did, for aught he knew.\n"+
		"But wherefore do you droop? why look you sad?\n"+
		"Be great in act, as you have been in thought;\n"+
		"Let not the world see fear and sad distrust\n"+
		"Govern the motion of a kingly eye:\n"+
		"Be stirring as the time; be fire with fire;\n"+
		"Threaten the threatener and outface the brow\n"+
		"Of bragging horror: so shall inferior eyes,\n"+
		"That borrow their behaviors from the great,\n"+
		"Grow great by your example and put on\n"+
		"The dauntless spirit of resolution.\n"+
		"Away, and glister like the god of war,\n"+
		"When he intendeth to become the field:\n"+
		"Show boldness and aspiring confidence.\n"+
		"What, shall they seek the lion in his den,\n"+
		"And fright him there? and make him tremble there?\n"+
		"O, let it not be said: forage, and run\n"+
		"To meet displeasure farther from the doors,\n"+
		"And grapple with him ere he comes so nigh.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"The legate of the pope hath been with me,\n"+
		"And I have made a happy peace with him;\n"+
		"And he hath promised to dismiss the powers\n"+
		"Led by the Dauphin.\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"O inglorious league!\n"+
		"Shall we, upon the footing of our land,\n"+
		"Send fair-play orders and make compromise,\n"+
		"Insinuation, parley and base truce\n"+
		"To arms invasive? shall a beardless boy,\n"+
		"A cocker'd silken wanton, brave our fields,\n"+
		"And flesh his spirit in a warlike soil,\n"+
		"Mocking the air with colours idly spread,\n"+
		"And find no cheque? Let us, my liege, to arms:\n"+
		"Perchance the cardinal cannot make your peace;\n"+
		"Or if he do, let it at least be said\n"+
		"They saw we had a purpose of defence.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Have thou the ordering of this present time.\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"Away, then, with good courage! yet, I know,\n"+
		"Our party may well meet a prouder foe.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. LEWIS's camp at St. Edmundsbury.\n"+
		"Enter, in arms, LEWIS, SALISBURY, MELUN, PEMBROKE, BIGOT, and Soldiers\n"+
		"LEWIS\n"+
		"My Lord Melun, let this be copied out,\n"+
		"And keep it safe for our remembrance:\n"+
		"Return the precedent to these lords again;\n"+
		"That, having our fair order written down,\n"+
		"Both they and we, perusing o'er these notes,\n"+
		"May know wherefore we took the sacrament\n"+
		"And keep our faiths firm and inviolable.\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"Upon our sides it never shall be broken.\n"+
		"And, noble Dauphin, albeit we swear\n"+
		"A voluntary zeal and an unurged faith\n"+
		"To your proceedings; yet believe me, prince,\n"+
		"I am not glad that such a sore of time\n"+
		"Should seek a plaster by contemn'd revolt,\n"+
		"And heal the inveterate canker of one wound\n"+
		"By making many. O, it grieves my soul,\n"+
		"That I must draw this metal from my side\n"+
		"To be a widow-maker! O, and there\n"+
		"Where honourable rescue and defence\n"+
		"Cries out upon the name of Salisbury!\n"+
		"But such is the infection of the time,\n"+
		"That, for the health and physic of our right,\n"+
		"We cannot deal but with the very hand\n"+
		"Of stern injustice and confused wrong.\n"+
		"And is't not pity, O my grieved friends,\n"+
		"That we, the sons and children of this isle,\n"+
		"Were born to see so sad an hour as this;\n"+
		"Wherein we step after a stranger march\n"+
		"Upon her gentle bosom, and fill up\n"+
		"Her enemies' ranks,--I must withdraw and weep\n"+
		"Upon the spot of this enforced cause,--\n"+
		"To grace the gentry of a land remote,\n"+
		"And follow unacquainted colours here?\n"+
		"What, here? O nation, that thou couldst remove!\n"+
		"That Neptune's arms, who clippeth thee about,\n"+
		"Would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself,\n"+
		"And grapple thee unto a pagan shore;\n"+
		"Where these two Christian armies might combine\n"+
		"The blood of malice in a vein of league,\n"+
		"And not to spend it so unneighbourly!\n"+
		"LEWIS\n"+
		"A noble temper dost thou show in this;\n"+
		"And great affections wrestling in thy bosom\n"+
		"Doth make an earthquake of nobility.\n"+
		"O, what a noble combat hast thou fought\n"+
		"Between compulsion and a brave respect!\n"+
		"Let me wipe off this honourable dew,\n"+
		"That silverly doth progress on thy cheeks:\n"+
		"My heart hath melted at a lady's tears,\n"+
		"Being an ordinary inundation;\n"+
		"But this effusion of such manly drops,\n"+
		"This shower, blown up by tempest of the soul,\n"+
		"Startles mine eyes, and makes me more amazed\n"+
		"Than had I seen the vaulty top of heaven\n"+
		"Figured quite o'er with burning meteors.\n"+
		"Lift up thy brow, renowned Salisbury,\n"+
		"And with a great heart heave away the storm:\n"+
		"Commend these waters to those baby eyes\n"+
		"That never saw the giant world enraged;\n"+
		"Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,\n"+
		"Full of warm blood, of mirth, of gossiping.\n"+
		"Come, come; for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep\n"+
		"Into the purse of rich prosperity\n"+
		"As Lewis himself: so, nobles, shall you all,\n"+
		"That knit your sinews to the strength of mine.\n"+
		"And even there, methinks, an angel spake:\n"+
		"Enter CARDINAL PANDULPH\n"+
		"Look, where the holy legate comes apace,\n"+
		"To give us warrant from the hand of heaven\n"+
		"And on our actions set the name of right\n"+
		"With holy breath.\n"+
		"CARDINAL PANDULPH\n"+
		"Hail, noble prince of France!\n"+
		"The next is this, King John hath reconciled\n"+
		"Himself to Rome; his spirit is come in,\n"+
		"That so stood out against the holy church,\n"+
		"The great metropolis and see of Rome:\n"+
		"Therefore thy threatening colours now wind up;\n"+
		"And tame the savage spirit of wild war,\n"+
		"That like a lion foster'd up at hand,\n"+
		"It may lie gently at the foot of peace,\n"+
		"And be no further harmful than in show.\n"+
		"LEWIS\n"+
		"Your grace shall pardon me, I will not back:\n"+
		"I am too high-born to be propertied,\n"+
		"To be a secondary at control,\n"+
		"Or useful serving-man and instrument,\n"+
		"To any sovereign state throughout the world.\n"+
		"Your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars\n"+
		"Between this chastised kingdom and myself,\n"+
		"And brought in matter that should feed this fire;\n"+
		"And now 'tis far too huge to be blown out\n"+
		"With that same weak wind which enkindled it.\n"+
		"You taught me how to know the face of right,\n"+
		"Acquainted me with interest to this land,\n"+
		"Yea, thrust this enterprise into my heart;\n"+
		"And come ye now to tell me John hath made\n"+
		"His peace with Rome? What is that peace to me?\n"+
		"I, by the honour of my marriage-bed,\n"+
		"After young Arthur, claim this land for mine;\n"+
		"And, now it is half-conquer'd, must I back\n"+
		"Because that John hath made his peace with Rome?\n"+
		"Am I Rome's slave? What penny hath Rome borne,\n"+
		"What men provided, what munition sent,\n"+
		"To underprop this action? Is't not I\n"+
		"That undergo this charge? who else but I,\n"+
		"And such as to my claim are liable,\n"+
		"Sweat in this business and maintain this war?\n"+
		"Have I not heard these islanders shout out\n"+
		"'Vive le roi!' as I have bank'd their towns?\n"+
		"Have I not here the best cards for the game,\n"+
		"To win this easy match play'd for a crown?\n"+
		"And shall I now give o'er the yielded set?\n"+
		"No, no, on my soul, it never shall be said.\n"+
		"CARDINAL PANDULPH\n"+
		"You look but on the outside of this work.\n"+
		"LEWIS\n"+
		"Outside or inside, I will not return\n"+
		"Till my attempt so much be glorified\n"+
		"As to my ample hope was promised\n"+
		"Before I drew this gallant head of war,\n"+
		"And cull'd these fiery spirits from the world,\n"+
		"To outlook conquest and to win renown\n"+
		"Even in the jaws of danger and of death.\n"+
		"Trumpet sounds\n"+
		"What lusty trumpet thus doth summon us?\n"+
		"Enter the BASTARD, attended\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"According to the fair play of the world,\n"+
		"Let me have audience; I am sent to speak:\n"+
		"My holy lord of Milan, from the king\n"+
		"I come, to learn how you have dealt for him;\n"+
		"And, as you answer, I do know the scope\n"+
		"And warrant limited unto my tongue.\n"+
		"CARDINAL PANDULPH\n"+
		"The Dauphin is too wilful-opposite,\n"+
		"And will not temporize with my entreaties;\n"+
		"He flatly says he'll not lay down his arms.\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"By all the blood that ever fury breathed,\n"+
		"The youth says well. Now hear our English king;\n"+
		"For thus his royalty doth speak in me.\n"+
		"He is prepared, and reason too he should:\n"+
		"This apish and unmannerly approach,\n"+
		"This harness'd masque and unadvised revel,\n"+
		"This unhair'd sauciness and boyish troops,\n"+
		"The king doth smile at; and is well prepared\n"+
		"To whip this dwarfish war, these pigmy arms,\n"+
		"From out the circle of his territories.\n"+
		"That hand which had the strength, even at your door,\n"+
		"To cudgel you and make you take the hatch,\n"+
		"To dive like buckets in concealed wells,\n"+
		"To crouch in litter of your stable planks,\n"+
		"To lie like pawns lock'd up in chests and trunks,\n"+
		"To hug with swine, to seek sweet safety out\n"+
		"In vaults and prisons, and to thrill and shake\n"+
		"Even at the crying of your nation's crow,\n"+
		"Thinking his voice an armed Englishman;\n"+
		"Shall that victorious hand be feebled here,\n"+
		"That in your chambers gave you chastisement?\n"+
		"No: know the gallant monarch is in arms\n"+
		"And like an eagle o'er his aery towers,\n"+
		"To souse annoyance that comes near his nest.\n"+
		"And you degenerate, you ingrate revolts,\n"+
		"You bloody Neroes, ripping up the womb\n"+
		"Of your dear mother England, blush for shame;\n"+
		"For your own ladies and pale-visaged maids\n"+
		"Like Amazons come tripping after drums,\n"+
		"Their thimbles into armed gauntlets change,\n"+
		"Their needles to lances, and their gentle hearts\n"+
		"To fierce and bloody inclination.\n"+
		"LEWIS\n"+
		"There end thy brave, and turn thy face in peace;\n"+
		"We grant thou canst outscold us: fare thee well;\n"+
		"We hold our time too precious to be spent\n"+
		"With such a brabbler.\n"+
		"CARDINAL PANDULPH\n"+
		"Give me leave to speak.\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"No, I will speak.\n"+
		"LEWIS\n"+
		"We will attend to neither.\n"+
		"Strike up the drums; and let the tongue of war\n"+
		"Plead for our interest and our being here.\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"Indeed your drums, being beaten, will cry out;\n"+
		"And so shall you, being beaten: do but start\n"+
		"An echo with the clamour of thy drum,\n"+
		"And even at hand a drum is ready braced\n"+
		"That shall reverberate all as loud as thine;\n"+
		"Sound but another, and another shall\n"+
		"As loud as thine rattle the welkin's ear\n"+
		"And mock the deep-mouth'd thunder: for at hand,\n"+
		"Not trusting to this halting legate here,\n"+
		"Whom he hath used rather for sport than need\n"+
		"Is warlike John; and in his forehead sits\n"+
		"A bare-ribb'd death, whose office is this day\n"+
		"To feast upon whole thousands of the French.\n"+
		"LEWIS\n"+
		"Strike up our drums, to find this danger out.\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"And thou shalt find it, Dauphin, do not doubt.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. The field of battle.\n"+
		"Alarums. Enter KING JOHN and HUBERT\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"How goes the day with us? O, tell me, Hubert.\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"Badly, I fear. How fares your majesty?\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"This fever, that hath troubled me so long,\n"+
		"Lies heavy on me; O, my heart is sick!\n"+
		"Enter a Messenger\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"My lord, your valiant kinsman, Faulconbridge,\n"+
		"Desires your majesty to leave the field\n"+
		"And send him word by me which way you go.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Tell him, toward Swinstead, to the abbey there.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Be of good comfort; for the great supply\n"+
		"That was expected by the Dauphin here,\n"+
		"Are wreck'd three nights ago on Goodwin Sands.\n"+
		"This news was brought to Richard but even now:\n"+
		"The French fight coldly, and retire themselves.\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Ay me! this tyrant fever burns me up,\n"+
		"And will not let me welcome this good news.\n"+
		"Set on toward Swinstead: to my litter straight;\n"+
		"Weakness possesseth me, and I am faint.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV. Another part of the field.\n"+
		"Enter SALISBURY, PEMBROKE, and BIGOT\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"I did not think the king so stored with friends.\n"+
		"PEMBROKE\n"+
		"Up once again; put spirit in the French:\n"+
		"If they miscarry, we miscarry too.\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"That misbegotten devil, Faulconbridge,\n"+
		"In spite of spite, alone upholds the day.\n"+
		"PEMBROKE\n"+
		"They say King John sore sick hath left the field.\n"+
		"Enter MELUN, wounded\n"+
		"MELUN\n"+
		"Lead me to the revolts of England here.\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"When we were happy we had other names.\n"+
		"PEMBROKE\n"+
		"It is the Count Melun.\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"Wounded to death.\n"+
		"MELUN\n"+
		"Fly, noble English, you are bought and sold;\n"+
		"Unthread the rude eye of rebellion\n"+
		"And welcome home again discarded faith.\n"+
		"Seek out King John and fall before his feet;\n"+
		"For if the French be lords of this loud day,\n"+
		"He means to recompense the pains you take\n"+
		"By cutting off your heads: thus hath he sworn\n"+
		"And I with him, and many moe with me,\n"+
		"Upon the altar at Saint Edmundsbury;\n"+
		"Even on that altar where we swore to you\n"+
		"Dear amity and everlasting love.\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"May this be possible? may this be true?\n"+
		"MELUN\n"+
		"Have I not hideous death within my view,\n"+
		"Retaining but a quantity of life,\n"+
		"Which bleeds away, even as a form of wax\n"+
		"Resolveth from his figure 'gainst the fire?\n"+
		"What in the world should make me now deceive,\n"+
		"Since I must lose the use of all deceit?\n"+
		"Why should I then be false, since it is true\n"+
		"That I must die here and live hence by truth?\n"+
		"I say again, if Lewis do win the day,\n"+
		"He is forsworn, if e'er those eyes of yours\n"+
		"Behold another day break in the east:\n"+
		"But even this night, whose black contagious breath\n"+
		"Already smokes about the burning crest\n"+
		"Of the old, feeble and day-wearied sun,\n"+
		"Even this ill night, your breathing shall expire,\n"+
		"Paying the fine of rated treachery\n"+
		"Even with a treacherous fine of all your lives,\n"+
		"If Lewis by your assistance win the day.\n"+
		"Commend me to one Hubert with your king:\n"+
		"The love of him, and this respect besides,\n"+
		"For that my grandsire was an Englishman,\n"+
		"Awakes my conscience to confess all this.\n"+
		"In lieu whereof, I pray you, bear me hence\n"+
		"From forth the noise and rumour of the field,\n"+
		"Where I may think the remnant of my thoughts\n"+
		"In peace, and part this body and my soul\n"+
		"With contemplation and devout desires.\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"We do believe thee: and beshrew my soul\n"+
		"But I do love the favour and the form\n"+
		"Of this most fair occasion, by the which\n"+
		"We will untread the steps of damned flight,\n"+
		"And like a bated and retired flood,\n"+
		"Leaving our rankness and irregular course,\n"+
		"Stoop low within those bounds we have o'erlook'd\n"+
		"And cabby run on in obedience\n"+
		"Even to our ocean, to our great King John.\n"+
		"My arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence;\n"+
		"For I do see the cruel pangs of death\n"+
		"Right in thine eye. Away, my friends! New flight;\n"+
		"And happy newness, that intends old right.\n"+
		"Exeunt, leading off MELUN\n"+
		"SCENE V. The French camp.\n"+
		"Enter LEWIS and his train\n"+
		"LEWIS\n"+
		"The sun of heaven methought was loath to set,\n"+
		"But stay'd and made the western welkin blush,\n"+
		"When English measure backward their own ground\n"+
		"In faint retire. O, bravely came we off,\n"+
		"When with a volley of our needless shot,\n"+
		"After such bloody toil, we bid good night;\n"+
		"And wound our tattering colours clearly up,\n"+
		"Last in the field, and almost lords of it!\n"+
		"Enter a Messenger\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Where is my prince, the Dauphin?\n"+
		"LEWIS\n"+
		"Here: what news?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"The Count Melun is slain; the English lords\n"+
		"By his persuasion are again fall'n off,\n"+
		"And your supply, which you have wish'd so long,\n"+
		"Are cast away and sunk on Goodwin Sands.\n"+
		"LEWIS\n"+
		"Ah, foul shrewd news! beshrew thy very heart!\n"+
		"I did not think to be so sad to-night\n"+
		"As this hath made me. Who was he that said\n"+
		"King John did fly an hour or two before\n"+
		"The stumbling night did part our weary powers?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Whoever spoke it, it is true, my lord.\n"+
		"LEWIS\n"+
		"Well; keep good quarter and good care to-night:\n"+
		"The day shall not be up so soon as I,\n"+
		"To try the fair adventure of to-morrow.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE VI. An open place in the neighbourhood of Swinstead Abbey.\n"+
		"Enter the BASTARD and HUBERT, severally\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"Who's there? speak, ho! speak quickly, or I shoot.\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"A friend. What art thou?\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"Of the part of England.\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"Whither dost thou go?\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"What's that to thee? why may not I demand\n"+
		"Of thine affairs, as well as thou of mine?\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"Hubert, I think?\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"Thou hast a perfect thought:\n"+
		"I will upon all hazards well believe\n"+
		"Thou art my friend, that know'st my tongue so well.\n"+
		"Who art thou?\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"Who thou wilt: and if thou please,\n"+
		"Thou mayst befriend me so much as to think\n"+
		"I come one way of the Plantagenets.\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"Unkind remembrance! thou and eyeless night\n"+
		"Have done me shame: brave soldier, pardon me,\n"+
		"That any accent breaking from thy tongue\n"+
		"Should 'scape the true acquaintance of mine ear.\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"Come, come; sans compliment, what news abroad?\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"Why, here walk I in the black brow of night,\n"+
		"To find you out.\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"Brief, then; and what's the news?\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"O, my sweet sir, news fitting to the night,\n"+
		"Black, fearful, comfortless and horrible.\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"Show me the very wound of this ill news:\n"+
		"I am no woman, I'll not swoon at it.\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"The king, I fear, is poison'd by a monk:\n"+
		"I left him almost speechless; and broke out\n"+
		"To acquaint you with this evil, that you might\n"+
		"The better arm you to the sudden time,\n"+
		"Than if you had at leisure known of this.\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"How did he take it? who did taste to him?\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"A monk, I tell you; a resolved villain,\n"+
		"Whose bowels suddenly burst out: the king\n"+
		"Yet speaks and peradventure may recover.\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"Who didst thou leave to tend his majesty?\n"+
		"HUBERT\n"+
		"Why, know you not? the lords are all come back,\n"+
		"And brought Prince Henry in their company;\n"+
		"At whose request the king hath pardon'd them,\n"+
		"And they are all about his majesty.\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"Withhold thine indignation, mighty heaven,\n"+
		"And tempt us not to bear above our power!\n"+
		"I'll tell tree, Hubert, half my power this night,\n"+
		"Passing these flats, are taken by the tide;\n"+
		"These Lincoln Washes have devoured them;\n"+
		"Myself, well mounted, hardly have escaped.\n"+
		"Away before: conduct me to the king;\n"+
		"I doubt he will be dead or ere I come.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE VII. The orchard in Swinstead Abbey.\n"+
		"Enter PRINCE HENRY, SALISBURY, and BIGOT\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"It is too late: the life of all his blood\n"+
		"Is touch'd corruptibly, and his pure brain,\n"+
		"Which some suppose the soul's frail dwelling-house,\n"+
		"Doth by the idle comments that it makes\n"+
		"Foretell the ending of mortality.\n"+
		"Enter PEMBROKE\n"+
		"PEMBROKE\n"+
		"His highness yet doth speak, and holds belief\n"+
		"That, being brought into the open air,\n"+
		"It would allay the burning quality\n"+
		"Of that fell poison which assaileth him.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Let him be brought into the orchard here.\n"+
		"Doth he still rage?\n"+
		"Exit BIGOT\n"+
		"PEMBROKE\n"+
		"He is more patient\n"+
		"Than when you left him; even now he sung.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"O vanity of sickness! fierce extremes\n"+
		"In their continuance will not feel themselves.\n"+
		"Death, having prey'd upon the outward parts,\n"+
		"Leaves them invisible, and his siege is now\n"+
		"Against the mind, the which he pricks and wounds\n"+
		"With many legions of strange fantasies,\n"+
		"Whi ch, in their throng and press to that last hold,\n"+
		"Confound themselves. 'Tis strange that death\n"+
		"should sing.\n"+
		"I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan,\n"+
		"Who chants a doleful hymn to his own death,\n"+
		"And from the organ-pipe of frailty sings\n"+
		"His soul and body to their lasting rest.\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"Be of good comfort, prince; for you are born\n"+
		"To set a form upon that indigest\n"+
		"Which he hath left so shapeless and so rude.\n"+
		"Enter Attendants, and BIGOT, carrying KING JOHN in a chair\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Ay, marry, now my soul hath elbow-room;\n"+
		"It would not out at windows nor at doors.\n"+
		"There is so hot a summer in my bosom,\n"+
		"That all my bowels crumble up to dust:\n"+
		"I am a scribbled form, drawn with a pen\n"+
		"Upon a parchment, and against this fire\n"+
		"Do I shrink up.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"How fares your majesty?\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"Poison'd,--ill fare--dead, forsook, cast off:\n"+
		"And none of you will bid the winter come\n"+
		"To thrust his icy fingers in my maw,\n"+
		"Nor let my kingdom's rivers take their course\n"+
		"Through my burn'd bosom, nor entreat the north\n"+
		"To make his bleak winds kiss my parched lips\n"+
		"And comfort me with cold. I do not ask you much,\n"+
		"I beg cold comfort; and you are so strait\n"+
		"And so ingrateful, you deny me that.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"O that there were some virtue in my tears,\n"+
		"That might relieve you!\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"The salt in them is hot.\n"+
		"Within me is a hell; and there the poison\n"+
		"Is as a fiend confined to tyrannize\n"+
		"On unreprievable condemned blood.\n"+
		"Enter the BASTARD\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"O, I am scalded with my violent motion,\n"+
		"And spleen of speed to see your majesty!\n"+
		"KING JOHN\n"+
		"O cousin, thou art come to set mine eye:\n"+
		"The tackle of my heart is crack'd and burn'd,\n"+
		"And all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail\n"+
		"Are turned to one thread, one little hair:\n"+
		"My heart hath one poor string to stay it by,\n"+
		"Which holds but till thy news be uttered;\n"+
		"And then all this thou seest is but a clod\n"+
		"And module of confounded royalty.\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"The Dauphin is preparing hitherward,\n"+
		"Where heaven He knows how we shall answer him;\n"+
		"For in a night the best part of my power,\n"+
		"As I upon advantage did remove,\n"+
		"Were in the Washes all unwarily\n"+
		"Devoured by the unexpected flood.\n"+
		"KING JOHN dies\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"You breathe these dead news in as dead an ear.\n"+
		"My liege! my lord! but now a king, now thus.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Even so must I run on, and even so stop.\n"+
		"What surety of the world, what hope, what stay,\n"+
		"When this was now a king, and now is clay?\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"Art thou gone so? I do but stay behind\n"+
		"To do the office for thee of revenge,\n"+
		"And then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven,\n"+
		"As it on earth hath been thy servant still.\n"+
		"Now, now, you stars that move in your right spheres,\n"+
		"Where be your powers? show now your mended faiths,\n"+
		"And instantly return with me again,\n"+
		"To push destruction and perpetual shame\n"+
		"Out of the weak door of our fainting land.\n"+
		"Straight let us seek, or straight we shall be sought;\n"+
		"The Dauphin rages at our very heels.\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"It seems you know not, then, so much as we:\n"+
		"The Cardinal Pandulph is within at rest,\n"+
		"Who half an hour since came from the Dauphin,\n"+
		"And brings from him such offers of our peace\n"+
		"As we with honour and respect may take,\n"+
		"With purpose presently to leave this war.\n"+
		"BASTARD\n"+
		"He will the rather do it when he sees\n"+
		"Ourselves well sinewed to our defence.\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"Nay, it is in a manner done already;\n"+
		"For many carriages he hath dispatch'd\n"+
		"To the sea-side, and put his cause and quarrel\n"+
		"To the disposing of the cardinal:\n"+
		"With whom yourself, myself and other lords,\n"+
		"If you think meet, this afternoon will post\n"+
		"To consummate this business happily.\n"+
