		"Winter's Tale\n"+
		"ACT I\n"+
		"SCENE I. Antechamber in LEONTES' palace.\n"+
		"Enter CAMILLO and ARCHIDAMUS\n"+
		"ARCHIDAMUS\n"+
		"If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, on\n"+
		"the like occasion whereon my services are now on\n"+
		"foot, you shall see, as I have said, great\n"+
		"difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia\n"+
		"means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.\n"+
		"ARCHIDAMUS\n"+
		"Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be\n"+
		"justified in our loves; for indeed--\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"Beseech you,--\n"+
		"ARCHIDAMUS\n"+
		"Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge:\n"+
		"we cannot with such magnificence--in so rare--I know\n"+
		"not what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks,\n"+
		"that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience,\n"+
		"may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse\n"+
		"us.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.\n"+
		"ARCHIDAMUS\n"+
		"Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me\n"+
		"and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.\n"+
		"They were trained together in their childhoods; and\n"+
		"there rooted betwixt them then such an affection,\n"+
		"which cannot choose but branch now. Since their\n"+
		"more mature dignities and royal necessities made\n"+
		"separation of their society, their encounters,\n"+
		"though not personal, have been royally attorneyed\n"+
		"with interchange of gifts, letters, loving\n"+
		"embassies; that they have seemed to be together,\n"+
		"though absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and\n"+
		"embraced, as it were, from the ends of opposed\n"+
		"winds. The heavens continue their loves!\n"+
		"ARCHIDAMUS\n"+
		"I think there is not in the world either malice or\n"+
		"matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable\n"+
		"comfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is a\n"+
		"gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came\n"+
		"into my note.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"I very well agree with you in the hopes of him: it\n"+
		"is a gallant child; one that indeed physics the\n"+
		"subject, makes old hearts fresh: they that went on\n"+
		"crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to\n"+
		"see him a man.\n"+
		"ARCHIDAMUS\n"+
		"Would they else be content to die?\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"Yes; if there were no other excuse why they should\n"+
		"desire to live.\n"+
		"ARCHIDAMUS\n"+
		"If the king had no son, they would desire to live\n"+
		"on crutches till he had one.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. A room of state in the same.\n"+
		"Enter LEONTES, HERMIONE, MAMILLIUS, POLIXENES, CAMILLO, and Attendants\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"Nine changes of the watery star hath been\n"+
		"The shepherd's note since we have left our throne\n"+
		"Without a burthen: time as long again\n"+
		"Would be find up, my brother, with our thanks;\n"+
		"And yet we should, for perpetuity,\n"+
		"Go hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher,\n"+
		"Yet standing in rich place, I multiply\n"+
		"With one 'We thank you' many thousands moe\n"+
		"That go before it.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Stay your thanks a while;\n"+
		"And pay them when you part.\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"Sir, that's to-morrow.\n"+
		"I am question'd by my fears, of what may chance\n"+
		"Or breed upon our absence; that may blow\n"+
		"No sneaping winds at home, to make us say\n"+
		"'This is put forth too truly:' besides, I have stay'd\n"+
		"To tire your royalty.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"We are tougher, brother,\n"+
		"Than you can put us to't.\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"No longer stay.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"One seven-night longer.\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"Very sooth, to-morrow.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"We'll part the time between's then; and in that\n"+
		"I'll no gainsaying.\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"Press me not, beseech you, so.\n"+
		"There is no tongue that moves, none, none i' the world,\n"+
		"So soon as yours could win me: so it should now,\n"+
		"Were there necessity in your request, although\n"+
		"'Twere needful I denied it. My affairs\n"+
		"Do even drag me homeward: which to hinder\n"+
		"Were in your love a whip to me; my stay\n"+
		"To you a charge and trouble: to save both,\n"+
		"Farewell, our brother.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Tongue-tied, our queen?\n"+
		"speak you.\n"+
		"HERMIONE\n"+
		"I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until\n"+
		"You have drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir,\n"+
		"Charge him too coldly. Tell him, you are sure\n"+
		"All in Bohemia's well; this satisfaction\n"+
		"The by-gone day proclaim'd: say this to him,\n"+
		"He's beat from his best ward.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Well said, Hermione.\n"+
		"HERMIONE\n"+
		"To tell, he longs to see his son, were strong:\n"+
		"But let him say so then, and let him go;\n"+
		"But let him swear so, and he shall not stay,\n"+
		"We'll thwack him hence with distaffs.\n"+
		"Yet of your royal presence I'll adventure\n"+
		"The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia\n"+
		"You take my lord, I'll give him my commission\n"+
		"To let him there a month behind the gest\n"+
		"Prefix'd for's parting: yet, good deed, Leontes,\n"+
		"I love thee not a jar o' the clock behind\n"+
		"What lady-she her lord. You'll stay?\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"No, madam.\n"+
		"HERMIONE\n"+
		"Nay, but you will?\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"I may not, verily.\n"+
		"HERMIONE\n"+
		"Verily!\n"+
		"You put me off with limber vows; but I,\n"+
		"Though you would seek to unsphere the\n"+
		"stars with oaths,\n"+
		"Should yet say 'Sir, no going.' Verily,\n"+
		"You shall not go: a lady's 'Verily' 's\n"+
		"As potent as a lord's. Will you go yet?\n"+
		"Force me to keep you as a prisoner,\n"+
		"Not like a guest; so you shall pay your fees\n"+
		"When you depart, and save your thanks. How say you?\n"+
		"My prisoner? or my guest? by your dread 'Verily,'\n"+
		"One of them you shall be.\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"Your guest, then, madam:\n"+
		"To be your prisoner should import offending;\n"+
		"Which is for me less easy to commit\n"+
		"Than you to punish.\n"+
		"HERMIONE\n"+
		"Not your gaoler, then,\n"+
		"But your kind hostess. Come, I'll question you\n"+
		"Of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys:\n"+
		"You were pretty lordings then?\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"We were, fair queen,\n"+
		"Two lads that thought there was no more behind\n"+
		"But such a day to-morrow as to-day,\n"+
		"And to be boy eternal.\n"+
		"HERMIONE\n"+
		"Was not my lord\n"+
		"The verier wag o' the two?\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"We were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun,\n"+
		"And bleat the one at the other: what we changed\n"+
		"Was innocence for innocence; we knew not\n"+
		"The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream'd\n"+
		"That any did. Had we pursued that life,\n"+
		"And our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd\n"+
		"With stronger blood, we should have answer'd heaven\n"+
		"Boldly 'not guilty;' the imposition clear'd\n"+
		"Hereditary ours.\n"+
		"HERMIONE\n"+
		"By this we gather\n"+
		"You have tripp'd since.\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"O my most sacred lady!\n"+
		"Temptations have since then been born to's; for\n"+
		"In those unfledged days was my wife a girl;\n"+
		"Your precious self had then not cross'd the eyes\n"+
		"Of my young play-fellow.\n"+
		"HERMIONE\n"+
		"Grace to boot!\n"+
		"Of this make no conclusion, lest you say\n"+
		"Your queen and I are devils: yet go on;\n"+
		"The offences we have made you do we'll answer,\n"+
		"If you first sinn'd with us and that with us\n"+
		"You did continue fault and that you slipp'd not\n"+
		"With any but with us.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Is he won yet?\n"+
		"HERMIONE\n"+
		"He'll stay my lord.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"At my request he would not.\n"+
		"Hermione, my dearest, thou never spokest\n"+
		"To better purpose.\n"+
		"HERMIONE\n"+
		"Never?\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Never, but once.\n"+
		"HERMIONE\n"+
		"What! have I twice said well? when was't before?\n"+
		"I prithee tell me; cram's with praise, and make's\n"+
		"As fat as tame things: one good deed dying tongueless\n"+
		"Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.\n"+
		"Our praises are our wages: you may ride's\n"+
		"With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere\n"+
		"With spur we beat an acre. But to the goal:\n"+
		"My last good deed was to entreat his stay:\n"+
		"What was my first? it has an elder sister,\n"+
		"Or I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace!\n"+
		"But once before I spoke to the purpose: when?\n"+
		"Nay, let me have't; I long.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Why, that was when\n"+
		"Three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death,\n"+
		"Ere I could make thee open thy white hand\n"+
		"And clap thyself my love: then didst thou utter\n"+
		"'I am yours for ever.'\n"+
		"HERMIONE\n"+
		"'Tis grace indeed.\n"+
		"Why, lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose twice:\n"+
		"The one for ever earn'd a royal husband;\n"+
		"The other for some while a friend.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"[Aside] Too hot, too hot!\n"+
		"To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.\n"+
		"I have tremor cordis on me: my heart dances;\n"+
		"But not for joy; not joy. This entertainment\n"+
		"May a free face put on, derive a liberty\n"+
		"From heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,\n"+
		"And well become the agent; 't may, I grant;\n"+
		"But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,\n"+
		"As now they are, and making practised smiles,\n"+
		"As in a looking-glass, and then to sigh, as 'twere\n"+
		"The mort o' the deer; O, that is entertainment\n"+
		"My bosom likes not, nor my brows! Mamillius,\n"+
		"Art thou my boy?\n"+
		"MAMILLIUS\n"+
		"Ay, my good lord.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"I' fecks!\n"+
		"Why, that's my bawcock. What, hast\n"+
		"smutch'd thy nose?\n"+
		"They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,\n"+
		"We must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain:\n"+
		"And yet the steer, the heifer and the calf\n"+
		"Are all call'd neat.--Still virginalling\n"+
		"Upon his palm!--How now, you wanton calf!\n"+
		"Art thou my calf?\n"+
		"MAMILLIUS\n"+
		"Yes, if you will, my lord.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that I have,\n"+
		"To be full like me: yet they say we are\n"+
		"Almost as like as eggs; women say so,\n"+
		"That will say anything but were they false\n"+
		"As o'er-dyed blacks, as wind, as waters, false\n"+
		"As dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes\n"+
		"No bourn 'twixt his and mine, yet were it true\n"+
		"To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,\n"+
		"Look on me with your welkin eye: sweet villain!\n"+
		"Most dear'st! my collop! Can thy dam?--may't be?--\n"+
		"Affection! thy intention stabs the centre:\n"+
		"Thou dost make possible things not so held,\n"+
		"Communicatest with dreams;--how can this be?--\n"+
		"With what's unreal thou coactive art,\n"+
		"And fellow'st nothing: then 'tis very credent\n"+
		"Thou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost,\n"+
		"And that beyond commission, and I find it,\n"+
		"And that to the infection of my brains\n"+
		"And hardening of my brows.\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"What means Sicilia?\n"+
		"HERMIONE\n"+
		"He something seems unsettled.\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"How, my lord!\n"+
		"What cheer? how is't with you, best brother?\n"+
		"HERMIONE\n"+
		"You look as if you held a brow of much distraction\n"+
		"Are you moved, my lord?\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"No, in good earnest.\n"+
		"How sometimes nature will betray its folly,\n"+
		"Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime\n"+
		"To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines\n"+
		"Of my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil\n"+
		"Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech'd,\n"+
		"In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,\n"+
		"Lest it should bite its master, and so prove,\n"+
		"As ornaments oft do, too dangerous:\n"+
		"How like, methought, I then was to this kernel,\n"+
		"This squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend,\n"+
		"Will you take eggs for money?\n"+
		"MAMILLIUS\n"+
		"No, my lord, I'll fight.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"You will! why, happy man be's dole! My brother,\n"+
		"Are you so fond of your young prince as we\n"+
		"Do seem to be of ours?\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"If at home, sir,\n"+
		"He's all my exercise, my mirth, my matter,\n"+
		"Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy,\n"+
		"My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all:\n"+
		"He makes a July's day short as December,\n"+
		"And with his varying childness cures in me\n"+
		"Thoughts that would thick my blood.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"So stands this squire\n"+
		"Officed with me: we two will walk, my lord,\n"+
		"And leave you to your graver steps. Hermione,\n"+
		"How thou lovest us, show in our brother's welcome;\n"+
		"Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap:\n"+
		"Next to thyself and my young rover, he's\n"+
		"Apparent to my heart.\n"+
		"HERMIONE\n"+
		"If you would seek us,\n"+
		"We are yours i' the garden: shall's attend you there?\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"To your own bents dispose you: you'll be found,\n"+
		"Be you beneath the sky.\n"+
		"Aside\n"+
		"I am angling now,\n"+
		"Though you perceive me not how I give line.\n"+
		"Go to, go to!\n"+
		"How she holds up the neb, the bill to him!\n"+
		"And arms her with the boldness of a wife\n"+
		"To her allowing husband!\n"+
		"Exeunt POLIXENES, HERMIONE, and Attendants\n"+
		"Gone already!\n"+
		"Inch-thick, knee-deep, o'er head and\n"+
		"ears a fork'd one!\n"+
		"Go, play, boy, play: thy mother plays, and I\n"+
		"Play too, but so disgraced a part, whose issue\n"+
		"Will hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamour\n"+
		"Will be my knell. Go, play, boy, play.\n"+
		"There have been,\n"+
		"Or I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now;\n"+
		"And many a man there is, even at this present,\n"+
		"Now while I speak this, holds his wife by the arm,\n"+
		"That little thinks she has been sluiced in's absence\n"+
		"And his pond fish'd by his next neighbour, by\n"+
		"Sir Smile, his neighbour: nay, there's comfort in't\n"+
		"Whiles other men have gates and those gates open'd,\n"+
		"As mine, against their will. Should all despair\n"+
		"That have revolted wives, the tenth of mankind\n"+
		"Would hang themselves. Physic for't there is none;\n"+
		"It is a bawdy planet, that will strike\n"+
		"Where 'tis predominant; and 'tis powerful, think it,\n"+
		"From east, west, north and south: be it concluded,\n"+
		"No barricado for a belly; know't;\n"+
		"It will let in and out the enemy\n"+
		"With bag and baggage: many thousand on's\n"+
		"Have the disease, and feel't not. How now, boy!\n"+
		"MAMILLIUS\n"+
		"I am like you, they say.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Why that's some comfort. What, Camillo there?\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"Ay, my good lord.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Go play, Mamillius; thou'rt an honest man.\n"+
		"Exit MAMILLIUS\n"+
		"Camillo, this great sir will yet stay longer.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"You had much ado to make his anchor hold:\n"+
		"When you cast out, it still came home.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Didst note it?\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"He would not stay at your petitions: made\n"+
		"His business more material.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Didst perceive it?\n"+
		"Aside\n"+
		"They're here with me already, whispering, rounding\n"+
		"'Sicilia is a so-forth:' 'tis far gone,\n"+
		"When I shall gust it last. How came't, Camillo,\n"+
		"That he did stay?\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"At the good queen's entreaty.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"At the queen's be't: 'good' should be pertinent\n"+
		"But, so it is, it is not. Was this taken\n"+
		"By any understanding pate but thine?\n"+
		"For thy conceit is soaking, will draw in\n"+
		"More than the common blocks: not noted, is't,\n"+
		"But of the finer natures? by some severals\n"+
		"Of head-piece extraordinary? lower messes\n"+
		"Perchance are to this business purblind? say.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"Business, my lord! I think most understand\n"+
		"Bohemia stays here longer.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Ha!\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"Stays here longer.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Ay, but why?\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"To satisfy your highness and the entreaties\n"+
		"Of our most gracious mistress.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Satisfy!\n"+
		"The entreaties of your mistress! satisfy!\n"+
		"Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,\n"+
		"With all the nearest things to my heart, as well\n"+
		"My chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou\n"+
		"Hast cleansed my bosom, I from thee departed\n"+
		"Thy penitent reform'd: but we have been\n"+
		"Deceived in thy integrity, deceived\n"+
		"In that which seems so.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"Be it forbid, my lord!\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"To bide upon't, thou art not honest, or,\n"+
		"If thou inclinest that way, thou art a coward,\n"+
		"Which hoxes honesty behind, restraining\n"+
		"From course required; or else thou must be counted\n"+
		"A servant grafted in my serious trust\n"+
		"And therein negligent; or else a fool\n"+
		"That seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,\n"+
		"And takest it all for jest.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"My gracious lord,\n"+
		"I may be negligent, foolish and fearful;\n"+
		"In every one of these no man is free,\n"+
		"But that his negligence, his folly, fear,\n"+
		"Among the infinite doings of the world,\n"+
		"Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,\n"+
		"If ever I were wilful-negligent,\n"+
		"It was my folly; if industriously\n"+
		"I play'd the fool, it was my negligence,\n"+
		"Not weighing well the end; if ever fearful\n"+
		"To do a thing, where I the issue doubted,\n"+
		"Where of the execution did cry out\n"+
		"Against the non-performance, 'twas a fear\n"+
		"Which oft infects the wisest: these, my lord,\n"+
		"Are such allow'd infirmities that honesty\n"+
		"Is never free of. But, beseech your grace,\n"+
		"Be plainer with me; let me know my trespass\n"+
		"By its own visage: if I then deny it,\n"+
		"'Tis none of mine.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Ha' not you seen, Camillo,--\n"+
		"But that's past doubt, you have, or your eye-glass\n"+
		"Is thicker than a cuckold's horn,--or heard,--\n"+
		"For to a vision so apparent rumour\n"+
		"Cannot be mute,--or thought,--for cogitation\n"+
		"Resides not in that man that does not think,--\n"+
		"My wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess,\n"+
		"Or else be impudently negative,\n"+
		"To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then say\n"+
		"My wife's a hobby-horse, deserves a name\n"+
		"As rank as any flax-wench that puts to\n"+
		"Before her troth-plight: say't and justify't.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"I would not be a stander-by to hear\n"+
		"My sovereign mistress clouded so, without\n"+
		"My present vengeance taken: 'shrew my heart,\n"+
		"You never spoke what did become you less\n"+
		"Than this; which to reiterate were sin\n"+
		"As deep as that, though true.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Is whispering nothing?\n"+
		"Is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?\n"+
		"Kissing with inside lip? stopping the career\n"+
		"Of laughing with a sigh?--a note infallible\n"+
		"Of breaking honesty--horsing foot on foot?\n"+
		"Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?\n"+
		"Hours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyes\n"+
		"Blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,\n"+
		"That would unseen be wicked? is this nothing?\n"+
		"Why, then the world and all that's in't is nothing;\n"+
		"The covering sky is nothing; Bohemia nothing;\n"+
		"My wife is nothing; nor nothing have these nothings,\n"+
		"If this be nothing.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"Good my lord, be cured\n"+
		"Of this diseased opinion, and betimes;\n"+
		"For 'tis most dangerous.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Say it be, 'tis true.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"No, no, my lord.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"It is; you lie, you lie:\n"+
		"I say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee,\n"+
		"Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,\n"+
		"Or else a hovering temporizer, that\n"+
		"Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,\n"+
		"Inclining to them both: were my wife's liver\n"+
		"Infected as her life, she would not live\n"+
		"The running of one glass.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"Who does infect her?\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Why, he that wears her like a medal, hanging\n"+
		"About his neck, Bohemia: who, if I\n"+
		"Had servants true about me, that bare eyes\n"+
		"To see alike mine honour as their profits,\n"+
		"Their own particular thrifts, they would do that\n"+
		"Which should undo more doing: ay, and thou,\n"+
		"His cupbearer,--whom I from meaner form\n"+
		"Have benched and reared to worship, who mayst see\n"+
		"Plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven,\n"+
		"How I am galled,--mightst bespice a cup,\n"+
		"To give mine enemy a lasting wink;\n"+
		"Which draught to me were cordial.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"Sir, my lord,\n"+
		"I could do this, and that with no rash potion,\n"+
		"But with a lingering dram that should not work\n"+
		"Maliciously like poison: but I cannot\n"+
		"Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress,\n"+
		"So sovereignly being honourable.\n"+
		"I have loved thee,--\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Make that thy question, and go rot!\n"+
		"Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,\n"+
		"To appoint myself in this vexation, sully\n"+
		"The purity and whiteness of my sheets,\n"+
		"Which to preserve is sleep, which being spotted\n"+
		"Is goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps,\n"+
		"Give scandal to the blood o' the prince my son,\n"+
		"Who I do think is mine and love as mine,\n"+
		"Without ripe moving to't? Would I do this?\n"+
		"Could man so blench?\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"I must believe you, sir:\n"+
		"I do; and will fetch off Bohemia for't;\n"+
		"Provided that, when he's removed, your highness\n"+
		"Will take again your queen as yours at first,\n"+
		"Even for your son's sake; and thereby for sealing\n"+
		"The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms\n"+
		"Known and allied to yours.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Thou dost advise me\n"+
		"Even so as I mine own course have set down:\n"+
		"I'll give no blemish to her honour, none.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"My lord,\n"+
		"Go then; and with a countenance as clear\n"+
		"As friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia\n"+
		"And with your queen. I am his cupbearer:\n"+
		"If from me he have wholesome beverage,\n"+
		"Account me not your servant.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"This is all:\n"+
		"Do't and thou hast the one half of my heart;\n"+
		"Do't not, thou split'st thine own.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"I'll do't, my lord.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"I will seem friendly, as thou hast advised me.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"O miserable lady! But, for me,\n"+
		"What case stand I in? I must be the poisoner\n"+
		"Of good Polixenes; and my ground to do't\n"+
		"Is the obedience to a master, one\n"+
		"Who in rebellion with himself will have\n"+
		"All that are his so too. To do this deed,\n"+
		"Promotion follows. If I could find example\n"+
		"Of thousands that had struck anointed kings\n"+
		"And flourish'd after, I'ld not do't; but since\n"+
		"Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one,\n"+
		"Let villany itself forswear't. I must\n"+
		"Forsake the court: to do't, or no, is certain\n"+
		"To me a break-neck. Happy star, reign now!\n"+
		"Here comes Bohemia.\n"+
		"Re-enter POLIXENES\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"This is strange: methinks\n"+
		"My favour here begins to warp. Not speak?\n"+
		"Good day, Camillo.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"Hail, most royal sir!\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"What is the news i' the court?\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"None rare, my lord.\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"The king hath on him such a countenance\n"+
		"As he had lost some province and a region\n"+
		"Loved as he loves himself: even now I met him\n"+
		"With customary compliment; when he,\n"+
		"Wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling\n"+
		"A lip of much contempt, speeds from me and\n"+
		"So leaves me to consider what is breeding\n"+
		"That changeth thus his manners.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"I dare not know, my lord.\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"How! dare not! do not. Do you know, and dare not?\n"+
		"Be intelligent to me: 'tis thereabouts;\n"+
		"For, to yourself, what you do know, you must.\n"+
		"And cannot say, you dare not. Good Camillo,\n"+
		"Your changed complexions are to me a mirror\n"+
		"Which shows me mine changed too; for I must be\n"+
		"A party in this alteration, finding\n"+
		"Myself thus alter'd with 't.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"There is a sickness\n"+
		"Which puts some of us in distemper, but\n"+
		"I cannot name the disease; and it is caught\n"+
		"Of you that yet are well.\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"How! caught of me!\n"+
		"Make me not sighted like the basilisk:\n"+
		"I have look'd on thousands, who have sped the better\n"+
		"By my regard, but kill'd none so. Camillo,--\n"+
		"As you are certainly a gentleman, thereto\n"+
		"Clerk-like experienced, which no less adorns\n"+
		"Our gentry than our parents' noble names,\n"+
		"In whose success we are gentle,--I beseech you,\n"+
		"If you know aught which does behove my knowledge\n"+
		"Thereof to be inform'd, imprison't not\n"+
		"In ignorant concealment.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"I may not answer.\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"A sickness caught of me, and yet I well!\n"+
		"I must be answer'd. Dost thou hear, Camillo,\n"+
		"I conjure thee, by all the parts of man\n"+
		"Which honour does acknowledge, whereof the least\n"+
		"Is not this suit of mine, that thou declare\n"+
		"What incidency thou dost guess of harm\n"+
		"Is creeping toward me; how far off, how near;\n"+
		"Which way to be prevented, if to be;\n"+
		"If not, how best to bear it.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"Sir, I will tell you;\n"+
		"Since I am charged in honour and by him\n"+
		"That I think honourable: therefore mark my counsel,\n"+
		"Which must be even as swiftly follow'd as\n"+
		"I mean to utter it, or both yourself and me\n"+
		"Cry lost, and so good night!\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"On, good Camillo.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"I am appointed him to murder you.\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"By whom, Camillo?\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"By the king.\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"For what?\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"He thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears,\n"+
		"As he had seen't or been an instrument\n"+
		"To vice you to't, that you have touch'd his queen\n"+
		"Forbiddenly.\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"O, then my best blood turn\n"+
		"To an infected jelly and my name\n"+
		"Be yoked with his that did betray the Best!\n"+
		"Turn then my freshest reputation to\n"+
		"A savour that may strike the dullest nostril\n"+
		"Where I arrive, and my approach be shunn'd,\n"+
		"Nay, hated too, worse than the great'st infection\n"+
		"That e'er was heard or read!\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"Swear his thought over\n"+
		"By each particular star in heaven and\n"+
		"By all their influences, you may as well\n"+
		"Forbid the sea for to obey the moon\n"+
		"As or by oath remove or counsel shake\n"+
		"The fabric of his folly, whose foundation\n"+
		"Is piled upon his faith and will continue\n"+
		"The standing of his body.\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"How should this grow?\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"I know not: but I am sure 'tis safer to\n"+
		"Avoid what's grown than question how 'tis born.\n"+
		"If therefore you dare trust my honesty,\n"+
		"That lies enclosed in this trunk which you\n"+
		"Shall bear along impawn'd, away to-night!\n"+
		"Your followers I will whisper to the business,\n"+
		"And will by twos and threes at several posterns\n"+
		"Clear them o' the city. For myself, I'll put\n"+
		"My fortunes to your service, which are here\n"+
		"By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain;\n"+
		"For, by the honour of my parents, I\n"+
		"Have utter'd truth: which if you seek to prove,\n"+
		"I dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer\n"+
		"Than one condemn'd by the king's own mouth, thereon\n"+
		"His execution sworn.\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"I do believe thee:\n"+
		"I saw his heart in 's face. Give me thy hand:\n"+
		"Be pilot to me and thy places shall\n"+
		"Still neighbour mine. My ships are ready and\n"+
		"My people did expect my hence departure\n"+
		"Two days ago. This jealousy\n"+
		"Is for a precious creature: as she's rare,\n"+
		"Must it be great, and as his person's mighty,\n"+
		"Must it be violent, and as he does conceive\n"+
		"He is dishonour'd by a man which ever\n"+
		"Profess'd to him, why, his revenges must\n"+
		"In that be made more bitter. Fear o'ershades me:\n"+
		"Good expedition be my friend, and comfort\n"+
		"The gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing\n"+
		"Of his ill-ta'en suspicion! Come, Camillo;\n"+
		"I will respect thee as a father if\n"+
		"Thou bear'st my life off hence: let us avoid.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"It is in mine authority to command\n"+
		"The keys of all the posterns: please your highness\n"+
		"To take the urgent hour. Come, sir, away.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT II\n"+
		"SCENE I. A room in LEONTES' palace.\n"+
		"Enter HERMIONE, MAMILLIUS, and Ladies\n"+
		"HERMIONE\n"+
		"Take the boy to you: he so troubles me,\n"+
		"'Tis past enduring.\n"+
		"First Lady\n"+
		"Come, my gracious lord,\n"+
		"Shall I be your playfellow?\n"+
		"MAMILLIUS\n"+
		"No, I'll none of you.\n"+
		"First Lady\n"+
		"Why, my sweet lord?\n"+
		"MAMILLIUS\n"+
		"You'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if\n"+
		"I were a baby still. I love you better.\n"+
		"Second Lady\n"+
		"And why so, my lord?\n"+
		"MAMILLIUS\n"+
		"Not for because\n"+
		"Your brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say,\n"+
		"Become some women best, so that there be not\n"+
		"Too much hair there, but in a semicircle\n"+
		"Or a half-moon made with a pen.\n"+
		"Second Lady\n"+
		"Who taught you this?\n"+
		"MAMILLIUS\n"+
		"I learnt it out of women's faces. Pray now\n"+
		"What colour are your eyebrows?\n"+
		"First Lady\n"+
		"Blue, my lord.\n"+
		"MAMILLIUS\n"+
		"Nay, that's a mock: I have seen a lady's nose\n"+
		"That has been blue, but not her eyebrows.\n"+
		"First Lady\n"+
		"Hark ye;\n"+
		"The queen your mother rounds apace: we shall\n"+
		"Present our services to a fine new prince\n"+
		"One of these days; and then you'ld wanton with us,\n"+
		"If we would have you.\n"+
		"Second Lady\n"+
		"She is spread of late\n"+
		"Into a goodly bulk: good time encounter her!\n"+
		"HERMIONE\n"+
		"What wisdom stirs amongst you? Come, sir, now\n"+
		"I am for you again: pray you, sit by us,\n"+
		"And tell 's a tale.\n"+
		"MAMILLIUS\n"+
		"Merry or sad shall't be?\n"+
		"HERMIONE\n"+
		"As merry as you will.\n"+
		"MAMILLIUS\n"+
		"A sad tale's best for winter: I have one\n"+
		"Of sprites and goblins.\n"+
		"HERMIONE\n"+
		"Let's have that, good sir.\n"+
		"Come on, sit down: come on, and do your best\n"+
		"To fright me with your sprites; you're powerful at it.\n"+
		"MAMILLIUS\n"+
		"There was a man--\n"+
		"HERMIONE\n"+
		"Nay, come, sit down; then on.\n"+
		"MAMILLIUS\n"+
		"Dwelt by a churchyard: I will tell it softly;\n"+
		"Yond crickets shall not hear it.\n"+
		"HERMIONE\n"+
		"Come on, then,\n"+
		"And give't me in mine ear.\n"+
		"Enter LEONTES, with ANTIGONUS, Lords and others\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Was he met there? his train? Camillo with him?\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"Behind the tuft of pines I met them; never\n"+
		"Saw I men scour so on their way: I eyed them\n"+
		"Even to their ships.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"How blest am I\n"+
		"In my just censure, in my true opinion!\n"+
		"Alack, for lesser knowledge! how accursed\n"+
		"In being so blest! There may be in the cup\n"+
		"A spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,\n"+
		"And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge\n"+
		"Is not infected: but if one present\n"+
		"The abhorr'd ingredient to his eye, make known\n"+
		"How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,\n"+
		"With violent hefts. I have drunk,\n"+
		"and seen the spider.\n"+
		"Camillo was his help in this, his pander:\n"+
		"There is a plot against my life, my crown;\n"+
		"All's true that is mistrusted: that false villain\n"+
		"Whom I employ'd was pre-employ'd by him:\n"+
		"He has discover'd my design, and I\n"+
		"Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick\n"+
		"For them to play at will. How came the posterns\n"+
		"So easily open?\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"By his great authority;\n"+
		"Which often hath no less prevail'd than so\n"+
		"On your command.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"I know't too well.\n"+
		"Give me the boy: I am glad you did not nurse him:\n"+
		"Though he does bear some signs of me, yet you\n"+
		"Have too much blood in him.\n"+
		"HERMIONE\n"+
		"What is this? sport?\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Bear the boy hence; he shall not come about her;\n"+
		"Away with him! and let her sport herself\n"+
		"With that she's big with; for 'tis Polixenes\n"+
		"Has made thee swell thus.\n"+
		"HERMIONE\n"+
		"But I'ld say he had not,\n"+
		"And I'll be sworn you would believe my saying,\n"+
		"Howe'er you lean to the nayward.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"You, my lords,\n"+
		"Look on her, mark her well; be but about\n"+
		"To say 'she is a goodly lady,' and\n"+
		"The justice of your bearts will thereto add\n"+
		"'Tis pity she's not honest, honourable:'\n"+
		"Praise her but for this her without-door form,\n"+
		"Which on my faith deserves high speech, and straight\n"+
		"The shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands\n"+
		"That calumny doth use--O, I am out--\n"+
		"That mercy does, for calumny will sear\n"+
		"Virtue itself: these shrugs, these hums and ha's,\n"+
		"When you have said 'she's goodly,' come between\n"+
		"Ere you can say 'she's honest:' but be 't known,\n"+
		"From him that has most cause to grieve it should be,\n"+
		"She's an adulteress.\n"+
		"HERMIONE\n"+
		"Should a villain say so,\n"+
		"The most replenish'd villain in the world,\n"+
		"He were as much more villain: you, my lord,\n"+
		"Do but mistake.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"You have mistook, my lady,\n"+
		"Polixenes for Leontes: O thou thing!\n"+
		"Which I'll not call a creature of thy place,\n"+
		"Lest barbarism, making me the precedent,\n"+
		"Should a like language use to all degrees\n"+
		"And mannerly distinguishment leave out\n"+
		"Betwixt the prince and beggar: I have said\n"+
		"She's an adulteress; I have said with whom:\n"+
		"More, she's a traitor and Camillo is\n"+
		"A federary with her, and one that knows\n"+
		"What she should shame to know herself\n"+
		"But with her most vile principal, that she's\n"+
		"A bed-swerver, even as bad as those\n"+
		"That vulgars give bold'st titles, ay, and privy\n"+
		"To this their late escape.\n"+
		"HERMIONE\n"+
		"No, by my life.\n"+
		"Privy to none of this. How will this grieve you,\n"+
		"When you shall come to clearer knowledge, that\n"+
		"You thus have publish'd me! Gentle my lord,\n"+
		"You scarce can right me throughly then to say\n"+
		"You did mistake.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"No; if I mistake\n"+
		"In those foundations which I build upon,\n"+
		"The centre is not big enough to bear\n"+
		"A school-boy's top. Away with her! to prison!\n"+
		"He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty\n"+
		"But that he speaks.\n"+
		"HERMIONE\n"+
		"There's some ill planet reigns:\n"+
		"I must be patient till the heavens look\n"+
		"With an aspect more favourable. Good my lords,\n"+
		"I am not prone to weeping, as our sex\n"+
		"Commonly are; the want of which vain dew\n"+
		"Perchance shall dry your pities: but I have\n"+
		"That honourable grief lodged here which burns\n"+
		"Worse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lords,\n"+
		"With thoughts so qualified as your charities\n"+
		"Shall best instruct you, measure me; and so\n"+
		"The king's will be perform'd!\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Shall I be heard?\n"+
		"HERMIONE\n"+
		"Who is't that goes with me? Beseech your highness,\n"+
		"My women may be with me; for you see\n"+
		"My plight requires it. Do not weep, good fools;\n"+
		"There is no cause: when you shall know your mistress\n"+
		"Has deserved prison, then abound in tears\n"+
		"As I come out: this action I now go on\n"+
		"Is for my better grace. Adieu, my lord:\n"+
		"I never wish'd to see you sorry; now\n"+
		"I trust I shall. My women, come; you have leave.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Go, do our bidding; hence!\n"+
		"Exit HERMIONE, guarded; with Ladies\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"Beseech your highness, call the queen again.\n"+
		"ANTIGONUS\n"+
		"Be certain what you do, sir, lest your justice\n"+
		"Prove violence; in the which three great ones suffer,\n"+
		"Yourself, your queen, your son.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"For her, my lord,\n"+
		"I dare my life lay down and will do't, sir,\n"+
		"Please you to accept it, that the queen is spotless\n"+
		"I' the eyes of heaven and to you; I mean,\n"+
		"In this which you accuse her.\n"+
		"ANTIGONUS\n"+
		"If it prove\n"+
		"She's otherwise, I'll keep my stables where\n"+
		"I lodge my wife; I'll go in couples with her;\n"+
		"Than when I feel and see her no farther trust her;\n"+
		"For every inch of woman in the world,\n"+
		"Ay, every dram of woman's flesh is false, If she be.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Hold your peaces.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"Good my lord,--\n"+
		"ANTIGONUS\n"+
		"It is for you we speak, not for ourselves:\n"+
		"You are abused and by some putter-on\n"+
		"That will be damn'd for't; would I knew the villain,\n"+
		"I would land-damn him. Be she honour-flaw'd,\n"+
		"I have three daughters; the eldest is eleven\n"+
		"The second and the third, nine, and some five;\n"+
		"If this prove true, they'll pay for't:\n"+
		"by mine honour,\n"+
		"I'll geld 'em all; fourteen they shall not see,\n"+
		"To bring false generations: they are co-heirs;\n"+
		"And I had rather glib myself than they\n"+
		"Should not produce fair issue.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Cease; no more.\n"+
		"You smell this business with a sense as cold\n"+
		"As is a dead man's nose: but I do see't and feel't\n"+
		"As you feel doing thus; and see withal\n"+
		"The instruments that feel.\n"+
		"ANTIGONUS\n"+
		"If it be so,\n"+
		"We need no grave to bury honesty:\n"+
		"There's not a grain of it the face to sweeten\n"+
		"Of the whole dungy earth.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"What! lack I credit?\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"I had rather you did lack than I, my lord,\n"+
		"Upon this ground; and more it would content me\n"+
		"To have her honour true than your suspicion,\n"+
		"Be blamed for't how you might.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Why, what need we\n"+
		"Commune with you of this, but rather follow\n"+
		"Our forceful instigation? Our prerogative\n"+
		"Calls not your counsels, but our natural goodness\n"+
		"Imparts this; which if you, or stupefied\n"+
		"Or seeming so in skill, cannot or will not\n"+
		"Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves\n"+
		"We need no more of your advice: the matter,\n"+
		"The loss, the gain, the ordering on't, is all\n"+
		"Properly ours.\n"+
		"ANTIGONUS\n"+
		"And I wish, my liege,\n"+
		"You had only in your silent judgment tried it,\n"+
		"Without more overture.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"How could that be?\n"+
		"Either thou art most ignorant by age,\n"+
		"Or thou wert born a fool. Camillo's flight,\n"+
		"Added to their familiarity,\n"+
		"Which was as gross as ever touch'd conjecture,\n"+
		"That lack'd sight only, nought for approbation\n"+
		"But only seeing, all other circumstances\n"+
		"Made up to the deed, doth push on this proceeding:\n"+
		"Yet, for a greater confirmation,\n"+
		"For in an act of this importance 'twere\n"+
		"Most piteous to be wild, I have dispatch'd in post\n"+
		"To sacred Delphos, to Apollo's temple,\n"+
		"Cleomenes and Dion, whom you know\n"+
		"Of stuff'd sufficiency: now from the oracle\n"+
		"They will bring all; whose spiritual counsel had,\n"+
		"Shall stop or spur me. Have I done well?\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"Well done, my lord.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Though I am satisfied and need no more\n"+
		"Than what I know, yet shall the oracle\n"+
		"Give rest to the minds of others, such as he\n"+
		"Whose ignorant credulity will not\n"+
		"Come up to the truth. So have we thought it good\n"+
		"From our free person she should be confined,\n"+
		"Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence\n"+
		"Be left her to perform. Come, follow us;\n"+
		"We are to speak in public; for this business\n"+
		"Will raise us all.\n"+
		"ANTIGONUS\n"+
		"[Aside]\n"+
		"To laughter, as I take it,\n"+
		"If the good truth were known.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. A prison.\n"+
		"Enter PAULINA, a Gentleman, and Attendants\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"The keeper of the prison, call to him;\n"+
		"let him have knowledge who I am.\n"+
		"Exit Gentleman\n"+
		"Good lady,\n"+
		"No court in Europe is too good for thee;\n"+
		"What dost thou then in prison?\n"+
		"Re-enter Gentleman, with the Gaoler\n"+
		"Now, good sir,\n"+
		"You know me, do you not?\n"+
		"Gaoler\n"+
		"For a worthy lady\n"+
		"And one whom much I honour.\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"Pray you then,\n"+
		"Conduct me to the queen.\n"+
		"Gaoler\n"+
		"I may not, madam:\n"+
		"To the contrary I have express commandment.\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"Here's ado,\n"+
		"To lock up honesty and honour from\n"+
		"The access of gentle visitors!\n"+
		"Is't lawful, pray you,\n"+
		"To see her women? any of them? Emilia?\n"+
		"Gaoler\n"+
		"So please you, madam,\n"+
		"To put apart these your attendants, I\n"+
		"Shall bring Emilia forth.\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"I pray now, call her.\n"+
		"Withdraw yourselves.\n"+
		"Exeunt Gentleman and Attendants\n"+
		"Gaoler\n"+
		"And, madam,\n"+
		"I must be present at your conference.\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"Well, be't so, prithee.\n"+
		"Exit Gaoler\n"+
		"Here's such ado to make no stain a stain\n"+
		"As passes colouring.\n"+
		"Re-enter Gaoler, with EMILIA\n"+
		"Dear gentlewoman,\n"+
		"How fares our gracious lady?\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"As well as one so great and so forlorn\n"+
		"May hold together: on her frights and griefs,\n"+
		"Which never tender lady hath born greater,\n"+
		"She is something before her time deliver'd.\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"A boy?\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"A daughter, and a goodly babe,\n"+
		"Lusty and like to live: the queen receives\n"+
		"Much comfort in't; says 'My poor prisoner,\n"+
		"I am innocent as you.'\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"I dare be sworn\n"+
		"These dangerous unsafe lunes i' the king,\n"+
		"beshrew them!\n"+
		"He must be told on't, and he shall: the office\n"+
		"Becomes a woman best; I'll take't upon me:\n"+
		"If I prove honey-mouth'd let my tongue blister\n"+
		"And never to my red-look'd anger be\n"+
		"The trumpet any more. Pray you, Emilia,\n"+
		"Commend my best obedience to the queen:\n"+
		"If she dares trust me with her little babe,\n"+
		"I'll show't the king and undertake to be\n"+
		"Her advocate to the loud'st. We do not know\n"+
		"How he may soften at the sight o' the child:\n"+
		"The silence often of pure innocence\n"+
		"Persuades when speaking fails.\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"Most worthy madam,\n"+
		"Your honour and your goodness is so evident\n"+
		"That your free undertaking cannot miss\n"+
		"A thriving issue: there is no lady living\n"+
		"So meet for this great errand. Please your ladyship\n"+
		"To visit the next room, I'll presently\n"+
		"Acquaint the queen of your most noble offer;\n"+
		"Who but to-day hammer'd of this design,\n"+
		"But durst not tempt a minister of honour,\n"+
		"Lest she should be denied.\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"Tell her, Emilia.\n"+
		"I'll use that tongue I have: if wit flow from't\n"+
		"As boldness from my bosom, let 't not be doubted\n"+

		"EMILIA\n"+
		"Now be you blest for it!\n"+
		"I'll to the queen: please you,\n"+
		"come something nearer.\n"+
		"Gaoler\n"+
		"Madam, if't please the queen to send the babe,\n"+
		"I know not what I shall incur to pass it,\n"+
		"Having no warrant.\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"You need not fear it, sir:\n"+
		"This child was prisoner to the womb and is\n"+
		"By law and process of great nature thence\n"+
		"Freed and enfranchised, not a party to\n"+
		"The anger of the king nor guilty of,\n"+
		"If any be, the trespass of the queen.\n"+
		"Gaoler\n"+
		"I do believe it.\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"Do not you fear: upon mine honour,\n"+
		"I will stand betwixt you and danger.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. A room in LEONTES' palace.\n"+
		"Enter LEONTES, ANTIGONUS, Lords, and Servants\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Nor night nor day no rest: it is but weakness\n"+
		"To bear the matter thus; mere weakness. If\n"+
		"The cause were not in being,--part o' the cause,\n"+
		"She the adulteress; for the harlot king\n"+
		"Is quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank\n"+
		"And level of my brain, plot-proof; but she\n"+
		"I can hook to me: say that she were gone,\n"+
		"Given to the fire, a moiety of my rest\n"+
		"Might come to me again. Who's there?\n"+
		"First Servant\n"+
		"My lord?\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"How does the boy?\n"+
		"First Servant\n"+
		"He took good rest to-night;\n"+
		"'Tis hoped his sickness is discharged.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"To see his nobleness!\n"+
		"Conceiving the dishonour of his mother,\n"+
		"He straight declined, droop'd, took it deeply,\n"+
		"Fasten'd and fix'd the shame on't in himself,\n"+
		"Threw off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep,\n"+
		"And downright languish'd. Leave me solely: go,\n"+
		"See how he fares.\n"+
		"Exit Servant\n"+
		"Fie, fie! no thought of him:\n"+
		"The thought of my revenges that way\n"+
		"Recoil upon me: in himself too mighty,\n"+
		"And in his parties, his alliance; let him be\n"+
		"Until a time may serve: for present vengeance,\n"+
		"Take it on her. Camillo and Polixenes\n"+
		"Laugh at me, make their pastime at my sorrow:\n"+
		"They should not laugh if I could reach them, nor\n"+
		"Shall she within my power.\n"+
		"Enter PAULINA, with a child\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"You must not enter.\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"Nay, rather, good my lords, be second to me:\n"+
		"Fear you his tyrannous passion more, alas,\n"+
		"Than the queen's life? a gracious innocent soul,\n"+
		"More free than he is jealous.\n"+
		"ANTIGONUS\n"+
		"That's enough.\n"+
		"Second Servant\n"+
		"Madam, he hath not slept tonight; commanded\n"+
		"None should come at him.\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"Not so hot, good sir:\n"+
		"I come to bring him sleep. 'Tis such as you,\n"+
		"That creep like shadows by him and do sigh\n"+
		"At each his needless heavings, such as you\n"+
		"Nourish the cause of his awaking: I\n"+
		"Do come with words as medicinal as true,\n"+
		"Honest as either, to purge him of that humour\n"+
		"That presses him from sleep.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"What noise there, ho?\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"No noise, my lord; but needful conference\n"+
		"About some gossips for your highness.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"How!\n"+
		"Away with that audacious lady! Antigonus,\n"+
		"I charged thee that she should not come about me:\n"+
		"I knew she would.\n"+
		"ANTIGONUS\n"+
		"I told her so, my lord,\n"+
		"On your displeasure's peril and on mine,\n"+
		"She should not visit you.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"What, canst not rule her?\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"From all dishonesty he can: in this,\n"+
		"Unless he take the course that you have done,\n"+
		"Commit me for committing honour, trust it,\n"+
		"He shall not rule me.\n"+
		"ANTIGONUS\n"+
		"La you now, you hear:\n"+
		"When she will take the rein I let her run;\n"+
		"But she'll not stumble.\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"Good my liege, I come;\n"+
		"And, I beseech you, hear me, who profess\n"+
		"Myself your loyal servant, your physician,\n"+
		"Your most obedient counsellor, yet that dare\n"+
		"Less appear so in comforting your evils,\n"+
		"Than such as most seem yours: I say, I come\n"+
		"From your good queen.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Good queen!\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"Good queen, my lord,\n"+
		"Good queen; I say good queen;\n"+
		"And would by combat make her good, so were I\n"+
		"A man, the worst about you.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Force her hence.\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"Let him that makes but trifles of his eyes\n"+
		"First hand me: on mine own accord I'll off;\n"+
		"But first I'll do my errand. The good queen,\n"+
		"For she is good, hath brought you forth a daughter;\n"+
		"Here 'tis; commends it to your blessing.\n"+
		"Laying down the child\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Out!\n"+
		"A mankind witch! Hence with her, out o' door:\n"+
		"A most intelligencing bawd!\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"Not so:\n"+
		"I am as ignorant in that as you\n"+
		"In so entitling me, and no less honest\n"+
		"Than you are mad; which is enough, I'll warrant,\n"+
		"As this world goes, to pass for honest.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Traitors!\n"+
		"Will you not push her out? Give her the bastard.\n"+
		"Thou dotard! thou art woman-tired, unroosted\n"+
		"By thy dame Partlet here. Take up the bastard;\n"+
		"Take't up, I say; give't to thy crone.\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"For ever\n"+
		"Unvenerable be thy hands, if thou\n"+
		"Takest up the princess by that forced baseness\n"+
		"Which he has put upon't!\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"He dreads his wife.\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"So I would you did; then 'twere past all doubt\n"+
		"You'ld call your children yours.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"A nest of traitors!\n"+
		"ANTIGONUS\n"+
		"I am none, by this good light.\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"Nor I, nor any\n"+
		"But one that's here, and that's himself, for he\n"+
		"The sacred honour of himself, his queen's,\n"+
		"His hopeful son's, his babe's, betrays to slander,\n"+
		"Whose sting is sharper than the sword's;\n"+
		"and will not--\n"+
		"For, as the case now stands, it is a curse\n"+
		"He cannot be compell'd to't--once remove\n"+
		"The root of his opinion, which is rotten\n"+
		"As ever oak or stone was sound.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"A callat\n"+
		"Of boundless tongue, who late hath beat her husband\n"+
		"And now baits me! This brat is none of mine;\n"+
		"It is the issue of Polixenes:\n"+
		"Hence with it, and together with the dam\n"+
		"Commit them to the fire!\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"It is yours;\n"+
		"And, might we lay the old proverb to your charge,\n"+
		"So like you, 'tis the worse. Behold, my lords,\n"+
		"Although the print be little, the whole matter\n"+
		"And copy of the father, eye, nose, lip,\n"+
		"The trick of's frown, his forehead, nay, the valley,\n"+
		"The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek,\n"+
		"His smiles,\n"+
		"The very mould and frame of hand, nail, finger:\n"+
		"And thou, good goddess Nature, which hast made it\n"+
		"So like to him that got it, if thou hast\n"+
		"The ordering of the mind too, 'mongst all colours\n"+
		"No yellow in't, lest she suspect, as he does,\n"+
		"Her children not her husband's!\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"A gross hag\n"+
		"And, lozel, thou art worthy to be hang'd,\n"+
		"That wilt not stay her tongue.\n"+
		"ANTIGONUS\n"+
		"Hang all the husbands\n"+
		"That cannot do that feat, you'll leave yourself\n"+
		"Hardly one subject.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Once more, take her hence.\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"A most unworthy and unnatural lord\n"+
		"Can do no more.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"I'll ha' thee burnt.\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"I care not:\n"+
		"It is an heretic that makes the fire,\n"+
		"Not she which burns in't. I'll not call you tyrant;\n"+
		"But this most cruel usage of your queen,\n"+
		"Not able to produce more accusation\n"+
		"Than your own weak-hinged fancy, something savours\n"+
		"Of tyranny and will ignoble make you,\n"+
		"Yea, scandalous to the world.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"On your allegiance,\n"+
		"Out of the chamber with her! Were I a tyrant,\n"+
		"Where were her life? she durst not call me so,\n"+
		"If she did know me one. Away with her!\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"I pray you, do not push me; I'll be gone.\n"+
		"Look to your babe, my lord; 'tis yours:\n"+
		"Jove send her\n"+
		"A better guiding spirit! What needs these hands?\n"+
		"You, that are thus so tender o'er his follies,\n"+
		"Will never do him good, not one of you.\n"+
		"So, so: farewell; we are gone.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Thou, traitor, hast set on thy wife to this.\n"+
		"My child? away with't! Even thou, that hast\n"+
		"A heart so tender o'er it, take it hence\n"+
		"And see it instantly consumed with fire;\n"+
		"Even thou and none but thou. Take it up straight:\n"+
		"Within this hour bring me word 'tis done,\n"+
		"And by good testimony, or I'll seize thy life,\n"+
		"With what thou else call'st thine. If thou refuse\n"+
		"And wilt encounter with my wrath, say so;\n"+
		"The bastard brains with these my proper hands\n"+
		"Shall I dash out. Go, take it to the fire;\n"+
		"For thou set'st on thy wife.\n"+
		"ANTIGONUS\n"+
		"I did not, sir:\n"+
		"These lords, my noble fellows, if they please,\n"+
		"Can clear me in't.\n"+
		"Lords\n"+
		"We can: my royal liege,\n"+
		"He is not guilty of her coming hither.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"You're liars all.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"Beseech your highness, give us better credit:\n"+
		"We have always truly served you, and beseech you\n"+
		"So to esteem of us, and on our knees we beg,\n"+
		"As recompense of our dear services\n"+
		"Past and to come, that you do change this purpose,\n"+
		"Which being so horrible, so bloody, must\n"+
		"Lead on to some foul issue: we all kneel.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"I am a feather for each wind that blows:\n"+
		"Shall I live on to see this bastard kneel\n"+
		"And call me father? better burn it now\n"+
		"Than curse it then. But be it; let it live.\n"+
		"It shall not neither. You, sir, come you hither;\n"+
		"You that have been so tenderly officious\n"+
		"With Lady Margery, your midwife there,\n"+
		"To save this bastard's life,--for 'tis a bastard,\n"+
		"So sure as this beard's grey,\n"+
		"--what will you adventure\n"+
		"To save this brat's life?\n"+
		"ANTIGONUS\n"+
		"Any thing, my lord,\n"+
		"That my ability may undergo\n"+
		"And nobleness impose: at least thus much:\n"+
		"I'll pawn the little blood which I have left\n"+
		"To save the innocent: any thing possible.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"It shall be possible. Swear by this sword\n"+
		"Thou wilt perform my bidding.\n"+
		"ANTIGONUS\n"+
		"I will, my lord.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Mark and perform it, see'st thou! for the fail\n"+
		"Of any point in't shall not only be\n"+
		"Death to thyself but to thy lewd-tongued wife,\n"+
		"Whom for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee,\n"+
		"As thou art liege-man to us, that thou carry\n"+
		"This female bastard hence and that thou bear it\n"+
		"To some remote and desert place quite out\n"+
		"Of our dominions, and that there thou leave it,\n"+
		"Without more mercy, to its own protection\n"+
		"And favour of the climate. As by strange fortune\n"+
		"It came to us, I do in justice charge thee,\n"+
		"On thy soul's peril and thy body's torture,\n"+
		"That thou commend it strangely to some place\n"+
		"Where chance may nurse or end it. Take it up.\n"+
		"ANTIGONUS\n"+
		"I swear to do this, though a present death\n"+
		"Had been more merciful. Come on, poor babe:\n"+
		"Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens\n"+
		"To be thy nurses! Wolves and bears, they say\n"+
		"Casting their savageness aside have done\n"+
		"Like offices of pity. Sir, be prosperous\n"+
		"In more than this deed does require! And blessing\n"+
		"Against this cruelty fight on thy side,\n"+
		"Poor thing, condemn'd to loss!\n"+
		"Exit with the child\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"No, I'll not rear\n"+
		"Another's issue.\n"+
		"Enter a Servant\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"Please your highness, posts\n"+
		"From those you sent to the oracle are come\n"+
		"An hour since: Cleomenes and Dion,\n"+
		"Being well arrived from Delphos, are both landed,\n"+
		"Hasting to the court.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"So please you, sir, their speed\n"+
		"Hath been beyond account.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Twenty-three days\n"+
		"They have been absent: 'tis good speed; foretells\n"+
		"The great Apollo suddenly will have\n"+
		"The truth of this appear. Prepare you, lords;\n"+
		"Summon a session, that we may arraign\n"+
		"Our most disloyal lady, for, as she hath\n"+
		"Been publicly accused, so shall she have\n"+
		"A just and open trial. While she lives\n"+
		"My heart will be a burthen to me. Leave me,\n"+
		"And think upon my bidding.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT III\n"+
		"SCENE I. A sea-port in Sicilia.\n"+
		"Enter CLEOMENES and DION\n"+
		"CLEOMENES\n"+
		"The climate's delicate, the air most sweet,\n"+
		"Fertile the isle, the temple much surpassing\n"+
		"The common praise it bears.\n"+
		"DION\n"+
		"I shall report,\n"+
		"For most it caught me, the celestial habits,\n"+
		"Methinks I so should term them, and the reverence\n"+
		"Of the grave wearers. O, the sacrifice!\n"+
		"How ceremonious, solemn and unearthly\n"+
		"It was i' the offering!\n"+
		"CLEOMENES\n"+
		"But of all, the burst\n"+
		"And the ear-deafening voice o' the oracle,\n"+
		"Kin to Jove's thunder, so surprised my sense.\n"+
		"That I was nothing.\n"+
		"DION\n"+
		"If the event o' the journey\n"+
		"Prove as successful to the queen,--O be't so!--\n"+
		"As it hath been to us rare, pleasant, speedy,\n"+
		"The time is worth the use on't.\n"+
		"CLEOMENES\n"+
		"Great Apollo\n"+
		"Turn all to the best! These proclamations,\n"+
		"So forcing faults upon Hermione,\n"+
		"I little like.\n"+
		"DION\n"+
		"The violent carriage of it\n"+
		"Will clear or end the business: when the oracle,\n"+
		"Thus by Apollo's great divine seal'd up,\n"+
		"Shall the contents discover, something rare\n"+
		"Even then will rush to knowledge. Go: fresh horses!\n"+
		"And gracious be the issue!\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. A court of Justice.\n"+
		"Enter LEONTES, Lords, and Officers\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"This sessions, to our great grief we pronounce,\n"+
		"Even pushes 'gainst our heart: the party tried\n"+
		"The daughter of a king, our wife, and one\n"+
		"Of us too much beloved. Let us be clear'd\n"+
		"Of being tyrannous, since we so openly\n"+
		"Proceed in justice, which shall have due course,\n"+
		"Even to the guilt or the purgation.\n"+
		"Produce the prisoner.\n"+
		"Officer\n"+
		"It is his highness' pleasure that the queen\n"+
		"Appear in person here in court. Silence!\n"+
		"Enter HERMIONE guarded; PAULINA and Ladies attending\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Read the indictment.\n"+
		"Officer\n"+
		"[Reads] Hermione, queen to the worthy\n"+
		"Leontes, king of Sicilia, thou art here accused and\n"+
		"arraigned of high treason, in committing adultery\n"+
		"with Polixenes, king of Bohemia, and conspiring\n"+
		"with Camillo to take away the life of our sovereign\n"+
		"lord the king, thy royal husband: the pretence\n"+
		"whereof being by circumstances partly laid open,\n"+
		"thou, Hermione, contrary to the faith and allegiance\n"+
		"of a true subject, didst counsel and aid them, for\n"+
		"their better safety, to fly away by night.\n"+
		"HERMIONE\n"+
		"Since what I am to say must be but that\n"+
		"Which contradicts my accusation and\n"+
		"The testimony on my part no other\n"+
		"But what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me\n"+
		"To say 'not guilty:' mine integrity\n"+
		"Being counted falsehood, shall, as I express it,\n"+
		"Be so received. But thus: if powers divine\n"+
		"Behold our human actions, as they do,\n"+
		"I doubt not then but innocence shall make\n"+
		"False accusation blush and tyranny\n"+
		"Tremble at patience. You, my lord, best know,\n"+
		"Who least will seem to do so, my past life\n"+
		"Hath been as continent, as chaste, as true,\n"+
		"As I am now unhappy; which is more\n"+
		"Than history can pattern, though devised\n"+
		"And play'd to take spectators. For behold me\n"+
		"A fellow of the royal bed, which owe\n"+
		"A moiety of the throne a great king's daughter,\n"+
		"The mother to a hopeful prince, here standing\n"+
		"To prate and talk for life and honour 'fore\n"+
		"Who please to come and hear. For life, I prize it\n"+
		"As I weigh grief, which I would spare: for honour,\n"+
		"'Tis a derivative from me to mine,\n"+
		"And only that I stand for. I appeal\n"+
		"To your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes\n"+
		"Came to your court, how I was in your grace,\n"+
		"How merited to be so; since he came,\n"+
		"With what encounter so uncurrent I\n"+
		"Have strain'd to appear thus: if one jot beyond\n"+
		"The bound of honour, or in act or will\n"+
		"That way inclining, harden'd be the hearts\n"+
		"Of all that hear me, and my near'st of kin\n"+
		"Cry fie upon my grave!\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"I ne'er heard yet\n"+
		"That any of these bolder vices wanted\n"+
		"Less impudence to gainsay what they did\n"+
		"Than to perform it first.\n"+
		"HERMIONE\n"+
		"That's true enough;\n"+
		"Through 'tis a saying, sir, not due to me.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"You will not own it.\n"+
		"HERMIONE\n"+
		"More than mistress of\n"+
		"Which comes to me in name of fault, I must not\n"+
		"At all acknowledge. For Polixenes,\n"+
		"With whom I am accused, I do confess\n"+
		"I loved him as in honour he required,\n"+
		"With such a kind of love as might become\n"+
		"A lady like me, with a love even such,\n"+
		"So and no other, as yourself commanded:\n"+
		"Which not to have done I think had been in me\n"+
		"Both disobedience and ingratitude\n"+
		"To you and toward your friend, whose love had spoke,\n"+
		"Even since it could speak, from an infant, freely\n"+
		"That it was yours. Now, for conspiracy,\n"+
		"I know not how it tastes; though it be dish'd\n"+
		"For me to try how: all I know of it\n"+
		"Is that Camillo was an honest man;\n"+
		"And why he left your court, the gods themselves,\n"+
		"Wotting no more than I, are ignorant.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"You knew of his departure, as you know\n"+
		"What you have underta'en to do in's absence.\n"+
		"HERMIONE\n"+
		"Sir,\n"+
		"You speak a language that I understand not:\n"+
		"My life stands in the level of your dreams,\n"+
		"Which I'll lay down.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Your actions are my dreams;\n"+
		"You had a bastard by Polixenes,\n"+
		"And I but dream'd it. As you were past all shame,--\n"+
		"Those of your fact are so--so past all truth:\n"+
		"Which to deny concerns more than avails; for as\n"+
		"Thy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,\n"+
		"No father owning it,--which is, indeed,\n"+
		"More criminal in thee than it,--so thou\n"+
		"Shalt feel our justice, in whose easiest passage\n"+
		"Look for no less than death.\n"+
		"HERMIONE\n"+
		"Sir, spare your threats:\n"+
		"The bug which you would fright me with I seek.\n"+
		"To me can life be no commodity:\n"+
		"The crown and comfort of my life, your favour,\n"+
		"I do give lost; for I do feel it gone,\n"+
		"But know not how it went. My second joy\n"+
		"And first-fruits of my body, from his presence\n"+
		"I am barr'd, like one infectious. My third comfort\n"+
		"Starr'd most unluckily, is from my breast,\n"+
		"The innocent milk in its most innocent mouth,\n"+
		"Haled out to murder: myself on every post\n"+
		"Proclaimed a strumpet: with immodest hatred\n"+
		"The child-bed privilege denied, which 'longs\n"+
		"To women of all fashion; lastly, hurried\n"+
		"Here to this place, i' the open air, before\n"+
		"I have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,\n"+
		"Tell me what blessings I have here alive,\n"+
		"That I should fear to die? Therefore proceed.\n"+
		"But yet hear this: mistake me not; no life,\n"+
		"I prize it not a straw, but for mine honour,\n"+
		"Which I would free, if I shall be condemn'd\n"+
		"Upon surmises, all proofs sleeping else\n"+
		"But what your jealousies awake, I tell you\n"+
		"'Tis rigor and not law. Your honours all,\n"+
		"I do refer me to the oracle:\n"+
		"Apollo be my judge!\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"This your request\n"+
		"Is altogether just: therefore bring forth,\n"+
		"And in Apollos name, his oracle.\n"+
		"Exeunt certain Officers\n"+
		"HERMIONE\n"+
		"The Emperor of Russia was my father:\n"+
		"O that he were alive, and here beholding\n"+
		"His daughter's trial! that he did but see\n"+
		"The flatness of my misery, yet with eyes\n"+
		"Of pity, not revenge!\n"+
		"Re-enter Officers, with CLEOMENES and DION\n"+
		"Officer\n"+
		"You here shall swear upon this sword of justice,\n"+
		"That you, Cleomenes and Dion, have\n"+
		"Been both at Delphos, and from thence have brought\n"+
		"The seal'd-up oracle, by the hand deliver'd\n"+
		"Of great Apollo's priest; and that, since then,\n"+

		"All this we swear.\n"+

		"Polixenes blameless; Camillo a true subject; Leontes\n"+
		"a jealous tyrant; his innocent babe truly begotten;\n"+

		"which is lost be not found.\n"+
		"Lords\n"+
		"Now blessed be the great Apollo!\n"+
		"HERMIONE\n"+
		"Praised!\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Hast thou read truth?\n"+
		"Officer\n"+
		"Ay, my lord; even so\n"+
		"As it is here set down.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"There is no truth at all i' the oracle:\n"+
		"The sessions shall proceed: this is mere falsehood.\n"+
		"Enter Servant\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"My lord the king, the king!\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"What is the business?\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"O sir, I shall be hated to report it!\n"+

		"I'll reconcile me to Polixenes,\n"+
		"New woo my queen, recall the good Camillo,\n"+
		"Whom I proclaim a man of truth, of mercy;\n"+
		"For, being transported by my jealousies\n"+
		"To bloody thoughts and to revenge, I chose\n"+
		"Camillo for the minister to poison\n"+
		"My friend Polixenes: which had been done,\n"+
		"But that the good mind of Camillo tardied\n"+
		"My swift command, though I with death and with\n"+

		"Not doing 't and being done: he, most humane\n"+
		"And fill'd with honour, to my kingly guest\n"+
		"Unclasp'd my practise, quit his fortunes here,\n"+
		"Which you knew great, and to the hazard\n"+
		"Of all encertainties himself commended,\n"+
		"No richer than his honour: how he glisters\n"+

		"Re-enter PAULINA\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"Woe the while!\n"+
		"O, cut my lace, lest my heart, cracking it,\n"+
		"Break too.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"What fit is this, good lady?\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?\n"+
		"What wheels? racks? fires? what flaying? boiling?\n"+
		"In leads or oils? what old or newer torture\n"+

		"To taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny\n"+
		"Together working with thy jealousies,\n"+
		"Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle\n"+
		"For girls of nine, O, think what they have done\n"+
		"And then run mad indeed, stark mad! for all\n"+
		"Thy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it.\n"+
		"That thou betray'dst Polixenes,'twas nothing;\n"+
		"That did but show thee, of a fool, inconstant\n"+
		"And damnable ingrateful: nor was't much,\n"+
		"Thou wouldst have poison'd good Camillo's honour,\n"+
		"To have him kill a king: poor trespasses,\n"+
		"More monstrous standing by: whereof I reckon\n"+
		"The casting forth to crows thy baby-daughter\n"+
		"To be or none or little; though a devil\n"+
		"Would have shed water out of fire ere done't:\n"+
		"Nor is't directly laid to thee, the death\n"+
		"Of the young prince, whose honourable thoughts,\n"+
		"Thoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heart\n"+
		"That could conceive a gross and foolish sire\n"+
		"Blemish'd his gracious dam: this is not, no,\n"+
		"Laid to thy answer: but the last,--O lords,\n"+
		"When I have said, cry 'woe!' the queen, the queen,\n"+
		"The sweet'st, dear'st creature's dead,\n"+
		"and vengeance for't\n"+
		"Not dropp'd down yet.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"The higher powers forbid!\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"I say she's dead; I'll swear't. If word nor oath\n"+
		"Prevail not, go and see: if you can bring\n"+
		"Tincture or lustre in her lip, her eye,\n"+
		"Heat outwardly or breath within, I'll serve you\n"+
		"As I would do the gods. But, O thou tyrant!\n"+
		"Do not repent these things, for they are heavier\n"+
		"Than all thy woes can stir; therefore betake thee\n"+
		"To nothing but despair. A thousand knees\n"+
		"Ten thousand years together, naked, fasting,\n"+
		"Upon a barren mountain and still winter\n"+
		"In storm perpetual, could not move the gods\n"+

		"Say no more:\n"+

		"I' the boldness of your speech.\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"I am sorry for't:\n"+
		"All faults I make, when I shall come to know them,\n"+
		"I do repent. Alas! I have show'd too much\n"+
		"The rashness of a woman: he is touch'd\n"+
		"To the noble heart. What's gone and what's past help\n"+
		"Should be past grief: do not receive affliction\n"+
		"At my petition; I beseech you, rather\n"+
		"Let me be punish'd, that have minded you\n"+
		"Of what you should forget. Now, good my liege\n"+
		"Sir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman:\n"+
		"The love I bore your queen--lo, fool again!--\n"+
		"I'll speak of her no more, nor of your children;\n"+
		"I'll not remember you of my own lord,\n"+
		"Who is lost too: take your patience to you,\n"+
		"And I'll say nothing.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Thou didst speak but well\n"+
		"When most the truth; which I receive much better\n"+
		"Than to be pitied of thee. Prithee, bring me\n"+
		"To the dead bodies of my queen and son:\n"+
		"One grave shall be for both: upon them shall\n"+
		"The causes of their death appear, unto\n"+
		"Our shame perpetual. Once a day I'll visit\n"+
		"The chapel where they lie, and tears shed there\n"+
		"Shall be my recreation: so long as nature\n"+
		"Will bear up with this exercise, so long\n"+
		"I daily vow to use it. Come and lead me\n"+
		"Unto these sorrows.\n"+

		"SCENE III. Bohemia. A desert country near the sea.\n"+

		"ANTIGONUS\n"+
		"Thou art perfect then, our ship hath touch'd upon\n"+
		"The deserts of Bohemia?\n"+
		"Mariner\n"+
		"Ay, my lord: and fear\n"+
		"We have landed in ill time: the skies look grimly\n"+
		"And threaten present blusters. In my conscience,\n"+
		"The heavens with that we have in hand are angry\n"+
		"And frown upon 's.\n"+
		"ANTIGONUS\n"+
		"Their sacred wills be done! Go, get aboard;\n"+
		"Look to thy bark: I'll not be long before\n"+
		"I call upon thee.\n"+
		"Mariner\n"+
		"Make your best haste, and go not\n"+
		"Too far i' the land: 'tis like to be loud weather;\n"+
		"Besides, this place is famous for the creatures\n"+
		"Of prey that keep upon't.\n"+
		"ANTIGONUS\n"+
		"Go thou away:\n"+
		"I'll follow instantly.\n"+
		"Mariner\n"+
		"I am glad at heart\n"+
		"To be so rid o' the business.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"ANTIGONUS\n"+
		"Come, poor babe:\n"+
		"I have heard, but not believed,\n"+
		"the spirits o' the dead\n"+
		"May walk again: if such thing be, thy mother\n"+
		"Appear'd to me last night, for ne'er was dream\n"+
		"So like a waking. To me comes a creature,\n"+
		"Sometimes her head on one side, some another;\n"+
		"I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,\n"+
		"So fill'd and so becoming: in pure white robes,\n"+
		"Like very sanctity, she did approach\n"+
		"My cabin where I lay; thrice bow'd before me,\n"+
		"And gasping to begin some speech, her eyes\n"+
		"Became two spouts: the fury spent, anon\n"+
		"Did this break-from her: 'Good Antigonus,\n"+
		"Since fate, against thy better disposition,\n"+
		"Hath made thy person for the thrower-out\n"+
		"Of my poor babe, according to thine oath,\n"+
		"Places remote enough are in Bohemia,\n"+
		"There weep and leave it crying; and, for the babe\n"+
		"Is counted lost for ever, Perdita,\n"+
		"I prithee, call't. For this ungentle business\n"+
		"Put on thee by my lord, thou ne'er shalt see\n"+
		"Thy wife Paulina more.' And so, with shrieks\n"+
		"She melted into air. Affrighted much,\n"+
		"I did in time collect myself and thought\n"+
		"This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys:\n"+
		"Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously,\n"+
		"I will be squared by this. I do believe\n"+
		"Hermione hath suffer'd death, and that\n"+
		"Apollo would, this being indeed the issue\n"+
		"Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid,\n"+
		"Either for life or death, upon the earth\n"+
		"Of its right father. Blossom, speed thee well!\n"+
		"There lie, and there thy character: there these;\n"+
		"Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,\n"+
		"And still rest thine. The storm begins; poor wretch,\n"+
		"That for thy mother's fault art thus exposed\n"+
		"To loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,\n"+
		"But my heart bleeds; and most accursed am I\n"+
		"To be by oath enjoin'd to this. Farewell!\n"+
		"The day frowns more and more: thou'rt like to have\n"+
		"A lullaby too rough: I never saw\n"+
		"The heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!\n"+
		"Well may I get aboard! This is the chase:\n"+
		"I am gone for ever.\n"+
		"Exit, pursued by a bear\n"+
		"Enter a Shepherd\n"+
		"Shepherd\n"+
		"I would there were no age between sixteen and\n"+
		"three-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the\n"+
		"rest; for there is nothing in the between but\n"+
		"getting wenches with child, wronging the ancientry,\n"+
		"stealing, fighting--Hark you now! Would any but\n"+
		"these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty\n"+
		"hunt this weather? They have scared away two of my\n"+
		"best sheep, which I fear the wolf will sooner find\n"+
		"than the master: if any where I have them, 'tis by\n"+
		"the seaside, browsing of ivy. Good luck, an't be thy\n"+
		"will what have we here! Mercy on 's, a barne a very\n"+
		"pretty barne! A boy or a child, I wonder? A\n"+
		"pretty one; a very pretty one: sure, some 'scape:\n"+
		"though I am not bookish, yet I can read\n"+
		"waiting-gentlewoman in the 'scape. This has been\n"+
		"some stair-work, some trunk-work, some\n"+
		"behind-door-work: they were warmer that got this\n"+
		"than the poor thing is here. I'll take it up for\n"+
		"pity: yet I'll tarry till my son come; he hallooed\n"+
		"but even now. Whoa, ho, hoa!\n"+
		"Enter Clown\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Hilloa, loa!\n"+
		"Shepherd\n"+
		"What, art so near? If thou'lt see a thing to talk\n"+
		"on when thou art dead and rotten, come hither. What\n"+
		"ailest thou, man?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"I have seen two such sights, by sea and by land!\n"+
		"but I am not to say it is a sea, for it is now the\n"+
		"sky: betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrust\n"+
		"a bodkin's point.\n"+
		"Shepherd\n"+
		"Why, boy, how is it?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"I would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages,\n"+
		"how it takes up the shore! but that's not the\n"+
		"point. O, the most piteous cry of the poor souls!\n"+
		"sometimes to see 'em, and not to see 'em; now the\n"+
		"ship boring the moon with her main-mast, and anon\n"+
		"swallowed with yest and froth, as you'ld thrust a\n"+
		"cork into a hogshead. And then for the\n"+
		"land-service, to see how the bear tore out his\n"+
		"shoulder-bone; how he cried to me for help and said\n"+
		"his name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make an\n"+
		"end of the ship, to see how the sea flap-dragoned\n"+
		"it: but, first, how the poor souls roared, and the\n"+
		"sea mocked them; and how the poor gentleman roared\n"+
		"and the bear mocked him, both roaring louder than\n"+
		"the sea or weather.\n"+
		"Shepherd\n"+
		"Name of mercy, when was this, boy?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Now, now: I have not winked since I saw these\n"+
		"sights: the men are not yet cold under water, nor\n"+
		"the bear half dined on the gentleman: he's at it\n"+
		"now.\n"+
		"Shepherd\n"+
		"Would I had been by, to have helped the old man!\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"I would you had been by the ship side, to have\n"+
		"helped her: there your charity would have lacked footing.\n"+
		"Shepherd\n"+
		"Heavy matters! heavy matters! but look thee here,\n"+
		"boy. Now bless thyself: thou mettest with things\n"+
		"dying, I with things newborn. Here's a sight for\n"+
		"thee; look thee, a bearing-cloth for a squire's\n"+
		"child! look thee here; take up, take up, boy;\n"+
		"open't. So, let's see: it was told me I should be\n"+
		"rich by the fairies. This is some changeling:\n"+
		"open't. What's within, boy?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"You're a made old man: if the sins of your youth\n"+
		"are forgiven you, you're well to live. Gold! all gold!\n"+
		"Shepherd\n"+
		"This is fairy gold, boy, and 'twill prove so: up\n"+
		"with't, keep it close: home, home, the next way.\n"+
		"We are lucky, boy; and to be so still requires\n"+
		"nothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go: come, good\n"+
		"boy, the next way home.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Go you the next way with your findings. I'll go see\n"+
		"if the bear be gone from the gentleman and how much\n"+
		"he hath eaten: they are never curst but when they\n"+
		"are hungry: if there be any of him left, I'll bury\n"+
		"it.\n"+
		"Shepherd\n"+
		"That's a good deed. If thou mayest discern by that\n"+
		"which is left of him what he is, fetch me to the\n"+
		"sight of him.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Marry, will I; and you shall help to put him i' the ground.\n"+
		"Shepherd\n"+
		"'Tis a lucky day, boy, and we'll do good deeds on't.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT IV\n"+
		"SCENE I:\n"+
		"Enter Time, the Chorus\n"+
		"Time\n"+
		"I, that please some, try all, both joy and terror\n"+
		"Of good and bad, that makes and unfolds error,\n"+
		"Now take upon me, in the name of Time,\n"+
		"To use my wings. Impute it not a crime\n"+
		"To me or my swift passage, that I slide\n"+
		"O'er sixteen years and leave the growth untried\n"+
		"Of that wide gap, since it is in my power\n"+
		"To o'erthrow law and in one self-born hour\n"+
		"To plant and o'erwhelm custom. Let me pass\n"+
		"The same I am, ere ancient'st order was\n"+
		"Or what is now received: I witness to\n"+
		"The times that brought them in; so shall I do\n"+
		"To the freshest things now reigning and make stale\n"+
		"The glistering of this present, as my tale\n"+
		"Now seems to it. Your patience this allowing,\n"+
		"I turn my glass and give my scene such growing\n"+
		"As you had slept between: Leontes leaving,\n"+
		"The effects of his fond jealousies so grieving\n"+
		"That he shuts up himself, imagine me,\n"+
		"Gentle spectators, that I now may be\n"+
		"In fair Bohemia, and remember well,\n"+
		"I mentioned a son o' the king's, which Florizel\n"+
		"I now name to you; and with speed so pace\n"+
		"To speak of Perdita, now grown in grace\n"+
		"Equal with wondering: what of her ensues\n"+
		"I list not prophecy; but let Time's news\n"+
		"Be known when 'tis brought forth.\n"+
		"A shepherd's daughter,\n"+
		"And what to her adheres, which follows after,\n"+
		"Is the argument of Time. Of this allow,\n"+
		"If ever you have spent time worse ere now;\n"+
		"If never, yet that Time himself doth say\n"+
		"He wishes earnestly you never may.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE II. Bohemia. The palace of POLIXENES.\n"+
		"Enter POLIXENES and CAMILLO\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"I pray thee, good Camillo, be no more importunate:\n"+
		"'tis a sickness denying thee any thing; a death to\n"+
		"grant this.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"It is fifteen years since I saw my country: though\n"+
		"I have for the most part been aired abroad, I\n"+
		"desire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent\n"+
		"king, my master, hath sent for me; to whose feeling\n"+
		"sorrows I might be some allay, or I o'erween to\n"+
		"think so, which is another spur to my departure.\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"As thou lovest me, Camillo, wipe not out the rest of\n"+
		"thy services by leaving me now: the need I have of\n"+
		"thee thine own goodness hath made; better not to\n"+
		"have had thee than thus to want thee: thou, having\n"+
		"made me businesses which none without thee can\n"+
		"sufficiently manage, must either stay to execute\n"+
		"them thyself or take away with thee the very\n"+
		"services thou hast done; which if I have not enough\n"+
		"considered, as too much I cannot, to be more\n"+
		"thankful to thee shall be my study, and my profit\n"+
		"therein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal\n"+
		"country, Sicilia, prithee speak no more; whose very\n"+
		"naming punishes me with the remembrance of that\n"+
		"penitent, as thou callest him, and reconciled king,\n"+
		"my brother; whose loss of his most precious queen\n"+
		"and children are even now to be afresh lamented.\n"+
		"Say to me, when sawest thou the Prince Florizel, my\n"+
		"son? Kings are no less unhappy, their issue not\n"+
		"being gracious, than they are in losing them when\n"+
		"they have approved their virtues.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"Sir, it is three days since I saw the prince. What\n"+
		"his happier affairs may be, are to me unknown: but I\n"+
		"have missingly noted, he is of late much retired\n"+
		"from court and is less frequent to his princely\n"+
		"exercises than formerly he hath appeared.\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"I have considered so much, Camillo, and with some\n"+
		"care; so far that I have eyes under my service which\n"+
		"look upon his removedness; from whom I have this\n"+
		"intelligence, that he is seldom from the house of a\n"+
		"most homely shepherd; a man, they say, that from\n"+
		"very nothing, and beyond the imagination of his\n"+
		"neighbours, is grown into an unspeakable estate.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"I have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a\n"+
		"daughter of most rare note: the report of her is\n"+
		"extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage.\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"That's likewise part of my intelligence; but, I\n"+
		"fear, the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou\n"+
		"shalt accompany us to the place; where we will, not\n"+
		"appearing what we are, have some question with the\n"+
		"shepherd; from whose simplicity I think it not\n"+
		"uneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thither.\n"+
		"Prithee, be my present partner in this business, and\n"+
		"lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"I willingly obey your command.\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"My best Camillo! We must disguise ourselves.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. A road near the Shepherd's cottage.\n"+
		"Enter AUTOLYCUS, singing\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"When daffodils begin to peer,\n"+
		"With heigh! the doxy over the dale,\n"+
		"Why, then comes in the sweet o' the year;\n"+
		"For the red blood reigns in the winter's pale.\n"+
		"The white sheet bleaching on the hedge,\n"+
		"With heigh! the sweet birds, O, how they sing!\n"+
		"Doth set my pugging tooth on edge;\n"+
		"For a quart of ale is a dish for a king.\n"+
		"The lark, that tirra-lyra chants,\n"+
		"With heigh! with heigh! the thrush and the jay,\n"+
		"Are summer songs for me and my aunts,\n"+
		"While we lie tumbling in the hay.\n"+
		"I have served Prince Florizel and in my time\n"+
		"wore three-pile; but now I am out of service:\n"+
		"But shall I go mourn for that, my dear?\n"+
		"The pale moon shines by night:\n"+
		"And when I wander here and there,\n"+
		"I then do most go right.\n"+
		"If tinkers may have leave to live,\n"+
		"And bear the sow-skin budget,\n"+
		"Then my account I well may, give,\n"+
		"And in the stocks avouch it.\n"+
		"My traffic is sheets; when the kite builds, look to\n"+
		"lesser linen. My father named me Autolycus; who\n"+
		"being, as I am, littered under Mercury, was likewise\n"+
		"a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. With die and\n"+
		"drab I purchased this caparison, and my revenue is\n"+
		"the silly cheat. Gallows and knock are too powerful\n"+
		"on the highway: beating and hanging are terrors to\n"+
		"me: for the life to come, I sleep out the thought\n"+
		"of it. A prize! a prize!\n"+
		"Enter Clown\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Let me see: every 'leven wether tods; every tod\n"+
		"yields pound and odd shilling; fifteen hundred\n"+
		"shorn. what comes the wool to?\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"[Aside]\n"+
		"If the springe hold, the cock's mine.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"I cannot do't without counters. Let me see; what am\n"+
		"I to buy for our sheep-shearing feast? Three pound\n"+
		"of sugar, five pound of currants, rice,--what will\n"+
		"this sister of mine do with rice? But my father\n"+
		"hath made her mistress of the feast, and she lays it\n"+
		"on. She hath made me four and twenty nose-gays for\n"+
		"the shearers, three-man-song-men all, and very good\n"+
		"ones; but they are most of them means and bases; but\n"+
		"one puritan amongst them, and he sings psalms to\n"+
		"horn-pipes. I must have saffron to colour the warden\n"+
		"pies; mace; dates?--none, that's out of my note;\n"+
		"nutmegs, seven; a race or two of ginger, but that I\n"+
		"may beg; four pound of prunes, and as many of\n"+
		"raisins o' the sun.\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"O that ever I was born!\n"+
		"Grovelling on the ground\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"I' the name of me--\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"O, help me, help me! pluck but off these rags; and\n"+
		"then, death, death!\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Alack, poor soul! thou hast need of more rags to lay\n"+
		"on thee, rather than have these off.\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"O sir, the loathsomeness of them offends me more\n"+
		"than the stripes I have received, which are mighty\n"+
		"ones and millions.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Alas, poor man! a million of beating may come to a\n"+
		"great matter.\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"I am robbed, sir, and beaten; my money and apparel\n"+
		"ta'en from me, and these detestable things put upon\n"+
		"me.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"What, by a horseman, or a footman?\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"A footman, sweet sir, a footman.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Indeed, he should be a footman by the garments he\n"+
		"has left with thee: if this be a horseman's coat,\n"+
		"it hath seen very hot service. Lend me thy hand,\n"+
		"I'll help thee: come, lend me thy hand.\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"O, good sir, tenderly, O!\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Alas, poor soul!\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"O, good sir, softly, good sir! I fear, sir, my\n"+
		"shoulder-blade is out.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"How now! canst stand?\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"[Picking his pocket]\n"+
		"Softly, dear sir; good sir, softly. You ha' done me\n"+
		"a charitable office.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Dost lack any money? I have a little money for thee.\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"No, good sweet sir; no, I beseech you, sir: I have\n"+
		"a kinsman not past three quarters of a mile hence,\n"+
		"unto whom I was going; I shall there have money, or\n"+
		"any thing I want: offer me no money, I pray you;\n"+
		"that kills my heart.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"What manner of fellow was he that robbed you?\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"A fellow, sir, that I have known to go about with\n"+
		"troll-my-dames; I knew him once a servant of the\n"+
		"prince: I cannot tell, good sir, for which of his\n"+
		"virtues it was, but he was certainly whipped out of the court.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"His vices, you would say; there's no virtue whipped\n"+
		"out of the court: they cherish it to make it stay\n"+
		"there; and yet it will no more but abide.\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"Vices, I would say, sir. I know this man well: he\n"+
		"hath been since an ape-bearer; then a\n"+
		"process-server, a bailiff; then he compassed a\n"+
		"motion of the Prodigal Son, and married a tinker's\n"+
		"wife within a mile where my land and living lies;\n"+
		"and, having flown over many knavish professions, he\n"+
		"settled only in rogue: some call him Autolycus.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Out upon him! prig, for my life, prig: he haunts\n"+
		"wakes, fairs and bear-baitings.\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"Very true, sir; he, sir, he; that's the rogue that\n"+
		"put me into this apparel.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Not a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia: if you had\n"+
		"but looked big and spit at him, he'ld have run.\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"I must confess to you, sir, I am no fighter: I am\n"+
		"false of heart that way; and that he knew, I warrant\n"+
		"him.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"How do you now?\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"Sweet sir, much better than I was; I can stand and\n"+
		"walk: I will even take my leave of you, and pace\n"+
		"softly towards my kinsman's.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Shall I bring thee on the way?\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"No, good-faced sir; no, sweet sir.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Then fare thee well: I must go buy spices for our\n"+
		"sheep-shearing.\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"Prosper you, sweet sir!\n"+
		"Exit Clown\n"+
		"Your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice.\n"+
		"I'll be with you at your sheep-shearing too: if I\n"+
		"make not this cheat bring out another and the\n"+
		"shearers prove sheep, let me be unrolled and my name\n"+
		"put in the book of virtue!\n"+
		"Sings\n"+
		"Jog on, jog on, the foot-path way,\n"+
		"And merrily hent the stile-a:\n"+
		"A merry heart goes all the day,\n"+
		"Your sad tires in a mile-a.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE IV. The Shepherd's cottage.\n"+
		"Enter FLORIZEL and PERDITA\n"+
		"FLORIZEL\n"+
		"These your unusual weeds to each part of you\n"+
		"Do give a life: no shepherdess, but Flora\n"+
		"Peering in April's front. This your sheep-shearing\n"+
		"Is as a meeting of the petty gods,\n"+
		"And you the queen on't.\n"+
		"PERDITA\n"+
		"Sir, my gracious lord,\n"+
		"To chide at your extremes it not becomes me:\n"+
		"O, pardon, that I name them! Your high self,\n"+
		"The gracious mark o' the land, you have obscured\n"+
		"With a swain's wearing, and me, poor lowly maid,\n"+
		"Most goddess-like prank'd up: but that our feasts\n"+
		"In every mess have folly and the feeders\n"+
		"Digest it with a custom, I should blush\n"+
		"To see you so attired, sworn, I think,\n"+
		"To show myself a glass.\n"+
		"FLORIZEL\n"+
		"I bless the time\n"+
		"When my good falcon made her flight across\n"+
		"Thy father's ground.\n"+
		"PERDITA\n"+
		"Now Jove afford you cause!\n"+
		"To me the difference forges dread; your greatness\n"+
		"Hath not been used to fear. Even now I tremble\n"+
		"To think your father, by some accident,\n"+
		"Should pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!\n"+
		"How would he look, to see his work so noble\n"+
		"Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how\n"+
		"Should I, in these my borrow'd flaunts, behold\n"+
		"The sternness of his presence?\n"+
		"FLORIZEL\n"+
		"Apprehend\n"+
		"Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,\n"+
		"Humbling their deities to love, have taken\n"+
		"The shapes of beasts upon them: Jupiter\n"+
		"Became a bull, and bellow'd; the green Neptune\n"+
		"A ram, and bleated; and the fire-robed god,\n"+
		"Golden Apollo, a poor humble swain,\n"+
		"As I seem now. Their transformations\n"+
		"Were never for a piece of beauty rarer,\n"+
		"Nor in a way so chaste, since my desires\n"+
		"Run not before mine honour, nor my lusts\n"+
		"Burn hotter than my faith.\n"+
		"PERDITA\n"+
		"O, but, sir,\n"+
		"Your resolution cannot hold, when 'tis\n"+
		"Opposed, as it must be, by the power of the king:\n"+
		"One of these two must be necessities,\n"+
		"Which then will speak, that you must\n"+
		"change this purpose,\n"+
		"Or I my life.\n"+
		"FLORIZEL\n"+
		"Thou dearest Perdita,\n"+
		"With these forced thoughts, I prithee, darken not\n"+
		"The mirth o' the feast. Or I'll be thine, my fair,\n"+
		"Or not my father's. For I cannot be\n"+
		"Mine own, nor any thing to any, if\n"+
		"I be not thine. To this I am most constant,\n"+
		"Though destiny say no. Be merry, gentle;\n"+
		"Strangle such thoughts as these with any thing\n"+
		"That you behold the while. Your guests are coming:\n"+
		"Lift up your countenance, as it were the day\n"+
		"Of celebration of that nuptial which\n"+
		"We two have sworn shall come.\n"+
		"PERDITA\n"+
		"O lady Fortune,\n"+
		"Stand you auspicious!\n"+
		"FLORIZEL\n"+
		"See, your guests approach:\n"+
		"Address yourself to entertain them sprightly,\n"+
		"And let's be red with mirth.\n"+
		"Enter Shepherd, Clown, MOPSA, DORCAS, and others, with POLIXENES and CAMILLO disguised\n"+
		"Shepherd\n"+
		"Fie, daughter! when my old wife lived, upon\n"+
		"This day she was both pantler, butler, cook,\n"+
		"Both dame and servant; welcomed all, served all;\n"+
		"Would sing her song and dance her turn; now here,\n"+
		"At upper end o' the table, now i' the middle;\n"+
		"On his shoulder, and his; her face o' fire\n"+
		"With labour and the thing she took to quench it,\n"+
		"She would to each one sip. You are retired,\n"+
		"As if you were a feasted one and not\n"+
		"The hostess of the meeting: pray you, bid\n"+
		"These unknown friends to's welcome; for it is\n"+
		"A way to make us better friends, more known.\n"+
		"Come, quench your blushes and present yourself\n"+
		"That which you are, mistress o' the feast: come on,\n"+
		"And bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing,\n"+
		"As your good flock shall prosper.\n"+
		"PERDITA\n"+
		"[To POLIXENES] Sir, welcome:\n"+
		"It is my father's will I should take on me\n"+
		"The hostess-ship o' the day.\n"+
		"To CAMILLO\n"+
		"You're welcome, sir.\n"+
		"Give me those flowers there, Dorcas. Reverend sirs,\n"+
		"For you there's rosemary and rue; these keep\n"+
		"Seeming and savour all the winter long:\n"+
		"Grace and remembrance be to you both,\n"+
		"And welcome to our shearing!\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"Shepherdess,\n"+
		"A fair one are you--well you fit our ages\n"+
		"With flowers of winter.\n"+
		"PERDITA\n"+
		"Sir, the year growing ancient,\n"+
		"Not yet on summer's death, nor on the birth\n"+
		"Of trembling winter, the fairest\n"+
		"flowers o' the season\n"+
		"Are our carnations and streak'd gillyvors,\n"+
		"Which some call nature's bastards: of that kind\n"+
		"Our rustic garden's barren; and I care not\n"+
		"To get slips of them.\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"Wherefore, gentle maiden,\n"+
		"Do you neglect them?\n"+
		"PERDITA\n"+
		"For I have heard it said\n"+
		"There is an art which in their piedness shares\n"+
		"With great creating nature.\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"Say there be;\n"+
		"Yet nature is made better by no mean\n"+
		"But nature makes that mean: so, over that art\n"+
		"Which you say adds to nature, is an art\n"+
		"That nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry\n"+
		"A gentler scion to the wildest stock,\n"+
		"And make conceive a bark of baser kind\n"+
		"By bud of nobler race: this is an art\n"+
		"Which does mend nature, change it rather, but\n"+
		"The art itself is nature.\n"+
		"PERDITA\n"+
		"So it is.\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"Then make your garden rich in gillyvors,\n"+
		"And do not call them bastards.\n"+
		"PERDITA\n"+
		"I'll not put\n"+
		"The dibble in earth to set one slip of them;\n"+
		"No more than were I painted I would wish\n"+
		"This youth should say 'twere well and only therefore\n"+
		"Desire to breed by me. Here's flowers for you;\n"+
		"Hot lavender, mints, savoury, marjoram;\n"+
		"The marigold, that goes to bed wi' the sun\n"+
		"And with him rises weeping: these are flowers\n"+
		"Of middle summer, and I think they are given\n"+
		"To men of middle age. You're very welcome.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"I should leave grazing, were I of your flock,\n"+
		"And only live by gazing.\n"+
		"PERDITA\n"+
		"Out, alas!\n"+
		"You'd be so lean, that blasts of January\n"+
		"Would blow you through and through.\n"+
		"Now, my fair'st friend,\n"+
		"I would I had some flowers o' the spring that might\n"+
		"Become your time of day; and yours, and yours,\n"+
		"That wear upon your virgin branches yet\n"+
		"Your maidenheads growing: O Proserpina,\n"+
		"For the flowers now, that frighted thou let'st fall\n"+
		"From Dis's waggon! daffodils,\n"+
		"That come before the swallow dares, and take\n"+
		"The winds of March with beauty; violets dim,\n"+
		"But sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes\n"+
		"Or Cytherea's breath; pale primroses\n"+
		"That die unmarried, ere they can behold\n"+
		"Bight Phoebus in his strength--a malady\n"+
		"Most incident to maids; bold oxlips and\n"+
		"The crown imperial; lilies of all kinds,\n"+
		"The flower-de-luce being one! O, these I lack,\n"+
		"To make you garlands of, and my sweet friend,\n"+
		"To strew him o'er and o'er!\n"+
		"FLORIZEL\n"+
		"What, like a corse?\n"+
		"PERDITA\n"+
		"No, like a bank for love to lie and play on;\n"+
		"Not like a corse; or if, not to be buried,\n"+
		"But quick and in mine arms. Come, take your flowers:\n"+
		"Methinks I play as I have seen them do\n"+
		"In Whitsun pastorals: sure this robe of mine\n"+
		"Does change my disposition.\n"+
		"FLORIZEL\n"+
		"What you do\n"+
		"Still betters what is done. When you speak, sweet.\n"+
		"I'ld have you do it ever: when you sing,\n"+
		"I'ld have you buy and sell so, so give alms,\n"+
		"Pray so; and, for the ordering your affairs,\n"+
		"To sing them too: when you do dance, I wish you\n"+
		"A wave o' the sea, that you might ever do\n"+
		"Nothing but that; move still, still so,\n"+
		"And own no other function: each your doing,\n"+
		"So singular in each particular,\n"+
		"Crowns what you are doing in the present deed,\n"+
		"That all your acts are queens.\n"+
		"PERDITA\n"+
		"O Doricles,\n"+
		"Your praises are too large: but that your youth,\n"+
		"And the true blood which peepeth fairly through't,\n"+
		"Do plainly give you out an unstain'd shepherd,\n"+
		"With wisdom I might fear, my Doricles,\n"+
		"You woo'd me the false way.\n"+
		"FLORIZEL\n"+
		"I think you have\n"+
		"As little skill to fear as I have purpose\n"+
		"To put you to't. But come; our dance, I pray:\n"+
		"Your hand, my Perdita: so turtles pair,\n"+
		"That never mean to part.\n"+
		"PERDITA\n"+
		"I'll swear for 'em.\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever\n"+
		"Ran on the green-sward: nothing she does or seems\n"+
		"But smacks of something greater than herself,\n"+
		"Too noble for this place.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"He tells her something\n"+
		"That makes her blood look out: good sooth, she is\n"+
		"The queen of curds and cream.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Come on, strike up!\n"+
		"DORCAS\n"+
		"Mopsa must be your mistress: marry, garlic,\n"+
		"To mend her kissing with!\n"+
		"MOPSA\n"+
		"Now, in good time!\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Not a word, a word; we stand upon our manners.\n"+
		"Come, strike up!\n"+
		"Music. Here a dance of Shepherds and Shepherdesses\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"Pray, good shepherd, what fair swain is this\n"+
		"Which dances with your daughter?\n"+
		"Shepherd\n"+
		"They call him Doricles; and boasts himself\n"+
		"To have a worthy feeding: but I have it\n"+
		"Upon his own report and I believe it;\n"+
		"He looks like sooth. He says he loves my daughter:\n"+
		"I think so too; for never gazed the moon\n"+
		"Upon the water as he'll stand and read\n"+
		"As 'twere my daughter's eyes: and, to be plain.\n"+
		"I think there is not half a kiss to choose\n"+
		"Who loves another best.\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"She dances featly.\n"+
		"Shepherd\n"+
		"So she does any thing; though I report it,\n"+
		"That should be silent: if young Doricles\n"+
		"Do light upon her, she shall bring him that\n"+
		"Which he not dreams of.\n"+
		"Enter Servant\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"O master, if you did but hear the pedlar at the\n"+
		"door, you would never dance again after a tabour and\n"+
		"pipe; no, the bagpipe could not move you: he sings\n"+
		"several tunes faster than you'll tell money; he\n"+
		"utters them as he had eaten ballads and all men's\n"+
		"ears grew to his tunes.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"He could never come better; he shall come in. I\n"+
		"love a ballad but even too well, if it be doleful\n"+
		"matter merrily set down, or a very pleasant thing\n"+
		"indeed and sung lamentably.\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"He hath songs for man or woman, of all sizes; no\n"+
		"milliner can so fit his customers with gloves: he\n"+
		"has the prettiest love-songs for maids; so without\n"+
		"bawdry, which is strange; with such delicate\n"+
		"burthens of dildos and fadings, 'jump her and thump\n"+
		"her;' and where some stretch-mouthed rascal would,\n"+
		"as it were, mean mischief and break a foul gap into\n"+
		"the matter, he makes the maid to answer 'Whoop, do me\n"+
		"no harm, good man;' puts him off, slights him, with\n"+
		"'Whoop, do me no harm, good man.'\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"This is a brave fellow.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Believe me, thou talkest of an admirable conceited\n"+
		"fellow. Has he any unbraided wares?\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"He hath ribbons of an the colours i' the rainbow;\n"+
		"points more than all the lawyers in Bohemia can\n"+
		"learnedly handle, though they come to him by the\n"+
		"gross: inkles, caddisses, cambrics, lawns: why, he\n"+
		"sings 'em over as they were gods or goddesses; you\n"+
		"would think a smock were a she-angel, he so chants\n"+
		"to the sleeve-hand and the work about the square on't.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Prithee bring him in; and let him approach singing.\n"+
		"PERDITA\n"+
		"Forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in 's tunes.\n"+
		"Exit Servant\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"You have of these pedlars, that have more in them\n"+
		"than you'ld think, sister.\n"+
		"PERDITA\n"+
		"Ay, good brother, or go about to think.\n"+
		"Enter AUTOLYCUS, singing\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"Lawn as white as driven snow;\n"+
		"Cyprus black as e'er was crow;\n"+
		"Gloves as sweet as damask roses;\n"+
		"Masks for faces and for noses;\n"+
		"Bugle bracelet, necklace amber,\n"+
		"Perfume for a lady's chamber;\n"+
		"Golden quoifs and stomachers,\n"+
		"For my lads to give their dears:\n"+
		"Pins and poking-sticks of steel,\n"+
		"What maids lack from head to heel:\n"+
		"Come buy of me, come; come buy, come buy;\n"+
		"Buy lads, or else your lasses cry: Come buy.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"If I were not in love with Mopsa, thou shouldst take\n"+
		"no money of me; but being enthralled as I am, it\n"+
		"will also be the bondage of certain ribbons and gloves.\n"+
		"MOPSA\n"+
		"I was promised them against the feast; but they come\n"+
		"not too late now.\n"+
		"DORCAS\n"+
		"He hath promised you more than that, or there be liars.\n"+
		"MOPSA\n"+
		"He hath paid you all he promised you; may be, he has\n"+
		"paid you more, which will shame you to give him again.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Is there no manners left among maids? will they\n"+
		"wear their plackets where they should bear their\n"+
		"faces? Is there not milking-time, when you are\n"+
		"going to bed, or kiln-hole, to whistle off these\n"+
		"secrets, but you must be tittle-tattling before all\n"+
		"our guests? 'tis well they are whispering: clamour\n"+
		"your tongues, and not a word more.\n"+
		"MOPSA\n"+
		"I have done. Come, you promised me a tawdry-lace\n"+
		"and a pair of sweet gloves.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Have I not told thee how I was cozened by the way\n"+
		"and lost all my money?\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"And indeed, sir, there are cozeners abroad;\n"+
		"therefore it behoves men to be wary.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Fear not thou, man, thou shalt lose nothing here.\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"I hope so, sir; for I have about me many parcels of charge.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"What hast here? ballads?\n"+
		"MOPSA\n"+
		"Pray now, buy some: I love a ballad in print o'\n"+
		"life, for then we are sure they are true.\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"Here's one to a very doleful tune, how a usurer's\n"+
		"wife was brought to bed of twenty money-bags at a\n"+
		"burthen and how she longed to eat adders' heads and\n"+
		"toads carbonadoed.\n"+
		"MOPSA\n"+
		"Is it true, think you?\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"Very true, and but a month old.\n"+
		"DORCAS\n"+
		"Bless me from marrying a usurer!\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"Here's the midwife's name to't, one Mistress\n"+
		"Tale-porter, and five or six honest wives that were\n"+
		"present. Why should I carry lies abroad?\n"+
		"MOPSA\n"+
		"Pray you now, buy it.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Come on, lay it by: and let's first see moe\n"+
		"ballads; we'll buy the other things anon.\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"Here's another ballad of a fish, that appeared upon\n"+
		"the coast on Wednesday the four-score of April,\n"+
		"forty thousand fathom above water, and sung this\n"+
		"ballad against the hard hearts of maids: it was\n"+
		"thought she was a woman and was turned into a cold\n"+
		"fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that\n"+
		"loved her: the ballad is very pitiful and as true.\n"+
		"DORCAS\n"+
		"Is it true too, think you?\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"Five justices' hands at it, and witnesses more than\n"+
		"my pack will hold.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Lay it by too: another.\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"This is a merry ballad, but a very pretty one.\n"+
		"MOPSA\n"+
		"Let's have some merry ones.\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"Why, this is a passing merry one and goes to\n"+
		"the tune of 'Two maids wooing a man:' there's\n"+
		"scarce a maid westward but she sings it; 'tis in\n"+
		"request, I can tell you.\n"+
		"MOPSA\n"+
		"We can both sing it: if thou'lt bear a part, thou\n"+
		"shalt hear; 'tis in three parts.\n"+
		"DORCAS\n"+
		"We had the tune on't a month ago.\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"I can bear my part; you must know 'tis my\n"+
		"occupation; have at it with you.\n"+
		"SONG\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"Get you hence, for I must go\n"+
		"Where it fits not you to know.\n"+
		"DORCAS\n"+
		"Whither?\n"+
		"MOPSA\n"+
		"O, whither?\n"+
		"DORCAS\n"+
		"Whither?\n"+
		"MOPSA\n"+
		"It becomes thy oath full well,\n"+
		"Thou to me thy secrets tell.\n"+
		"DORCAS\n"+
		"Me too, let me go thither.\n"+
		"MOPSA\n"+
		"Or thou goest to the orange or mill.\n"+
		"DORCAS\n"+
		"If to either, thou dost ill.\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"Neither.\n"+
		"DORCAS\n"+
		"What, neither?\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"Neither.\n"+
		"DORCAS\n"+
		"Thou hast sworn my love to be.\n"+
		"MOPSA\n"+
		"Thou hast sworn it more to me:\n"+
		"Then whither goest? say, whither?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"We'll have this song out anon by ourselves: my\n"+
		"father and the gentlemen are in sad talk, and we'll\n"+
		"not trouble them. Come, bring away thy pack after\n"+
		"me. Wenches, I'll buy for you both. Pedlar, let's\n"+
		"have the first choice. Follow me, girls.\n"+
		"Exit with DORCAS and MOPSA\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"And you shall pay well for 'em.\n"+
		"Follows singing\n"+
		"Will you buy any tape,\n"+
		"Or lace for your cape,\n"+
		"My dainty duck, my dear-a?\n"+
		"Any silk, any thread,\n"+
		"Any toys for your head,\n"+
		"Of the new'st and finest, finest wear-a?\n"+
		"Come to the pedlar;\n"+
		"Money's a medler.\n"+
		"That doth utter all men's ware-a.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"Re-enter Servant\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"Master, there is three carters, three shepherds,\n"+
		"three neat-herds, three swine-herds, that have made\n"+
		"themselves all men of hair, they call themselves\n"+
		"Saltiers, and they have a dance which the wenches\n"+
		"say is a gallimaufry of gambols, because they are\n"+
		"not in't; but they themselves are o' the mind, if it\n"+
		"be not too rough for some that know little but\n"+
		"bowling, it will please plentifully.\n"+
		"Shepherd\n"+
		"Away! we'll none on 't: here has been too much\n"+
		"homely foolery already. I know, sir, we weary you.\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"You weary those that refresh us: pray, let's see\n"+
		"these four threes of herdsmen.\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"One three of them, by their own report, sir, hath\n"+
		"danced before the king; and not the worst of the\n"+
		"three but jumps twelve foot and a half by the squier.\n"+
		"Shepherd\n"+
		"Leave your prating: since these good men are\n"+
		"pleased, let them come in; but quickly now.\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"Why, they stay at door, sir.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"Here a dance of twelve Satyrs\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"O, father, you'll know more of that hereafter.\n"+
		"To CAMILLO\n"+
		"Is it not too far gone? 'Tis time to part them.\n"+
		"He's simple and tells much.\n"+
		"To FLORIZEL\n"+
		"How now, fair shepherd!\n"+
		"Your heart is full of something that does take\n"+
		"Your mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young\n"+
		"And handed love as you do, I was wont\n"+
		"To load my she with knacks: I would have ransack'd\n"+
		"The pedlar's silken treasury and have pour'd it\n"+
		"To her acceptance; you have let him go\n"+
		"And nothing marted with him. If your lass\n"+
		"Interpretation should abuse and call this\n"+
		"Your lack of love or bounty, you were straited\n"+
		"For a reply, at least if you make a care\n"+
		"Of happy holding her.\n"+
		"FLORIZEL\n"+
		"Old sir, I know\n"+
		"She prizes not such trifles as these are:\n"+
		"The gifts she looks from me are pack'd and lock'd\n"+
		"Up in my heart; which I have given already,\n"+
		"But not deliver'd. O, hear me breathe my life\n"+
		"Before this ancient sir, who, it should seem,\n"+
		"Hath sometime loved! I take thy hand, this hand,\n"+
		"As soft as dove's down and as white as it,\n"+
		"Or Ethiopian's tooth, or the fann'd\n"+
		"snow that's bolted\n"+
		"By the northern blasts twice o'er.\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"What follows this?\n"+
		"How prettily the young swain seems to wash\n"+
		"The hand was fair before! I have put you out:\n"+
		"But to your protestation; let me hear\n"+
		"What you profess.\n"+
		"FLORIZEL\n"+
		"Do, and be witness to 't.\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"And this my neighbour too?\n"+
		"FLORIZEL\n"+
		"And he, and more\n"+
		"Than he, and men, the earth, the heavens, and all:\n"+
		"That, were I crown'd the most imperial monarch,\n"+
		"Thereof most worthy, were I the fairest youth\n"+
		"That ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledge\n"+
		"More than was ever man's, I would not prize them\n"+
		"Without her love; for her employ them all;\n"+
		"Commend them and condemn them to her service\n"+
		"Or to their own perdition.\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"Fairly offer'd.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"This shows a sound affection.\n"+
		"Shepherd\n"+
		"But, my daughter,\n"+
		"Say you the like to him?\n"+
		"PERDITA\n"+
		"I cannot speak\n"+
		"So well, nothing so well; no, nor mean better:\n"+
		"By the pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out\n"+
		"The purity of his.\n"+
		"Shepherd\n"+
		"Take hands, a bargain!\n"+
		"And, friends unknown, you shall bear witness to 't:\n"+
		"I give my daughter to him, and will make\n"+
		"Her portion equal his.\n"+
		"FLORIZEL\n"+
		"O, that must be\n"+
		"I' the virtue of your daughter: one being dead,\n"+
		"I shall have more than you can dream of yet;\n"+
		"Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,\n"+
		"Contract us 'fore these witnesses.\n"+
		"Shepherd\n"+
		"Come, your hand;\n"+
		"And, daughter, yours.\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"Soft, swain, awhile, beseech you;\n"+
		"Have you a father?\n"+
		"FLORIZEL\n"+
		"I have: but what of him?\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"Knows he of this?\n"+
		"FLORIZEL\n"+
		"He neither does nor shall.\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"Methinks a father\n"+
		"Is at the nuptial of his son a guest\n"+
		"That best becomes the table. Pray you once more,\n"+
		"Is not your father grown incapable\n"+
		"Of reasonable affairs? is he not stupid\n"+
		"With age and altering rheums? can he speak? hear?\n"+
		"Know man from man? dispute his own estate?\n"+
		"Lies he not bed-rid? and again does nothing\n"+
		"But what he did being childish?\n"+
		"FLORIZEL\n"+
		"No, good sir;\n"+
		"He has his health and ampler strength indeed\n"+
		"Than most have of his age.\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"By my white beard,\n"+
		"You offer him, if this be so, a wrong\n"+
		"Something unfilial: reason my son\n"+
		"Should choose himself a wife, but as good reason\n"+
		"The father, all whose joy is nothing else\n"+
		"But fair posterity, should hold some counsel\n"+
		"In such a business.\n"+
		"FLORIZEL\n"+
		"I yield all this;\n"+
		"But for some other reasons, my grave sir,\n"+
		"Which 'tis not fit you know, I not acquaint\n"+
		"My father of this business.\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"Let him know't.\n"+
		"FLORIZEL\n"+
		"He shall not.\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"Prithee, let him.\n"+
		"FLORIZEL\n"+
		"No, he must not.\n"+
		"Shepherd\n"+
		"Let him, my son: he shall not need to grieve\n"+
		"At knowing of thy choice.\n"+
		"FLORIZEL\n"+
		"Come, come, he must not.\n"+
		"Mark our contract.\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"Mark your divorce, young sir,\n"+
		"Discovering himself\n"+
		"Whom son I dare not call; thou art too base\n"+
		"To be acknowledged: thou a sceptre's heir,\n"+
		"That thus affect'st a sheep-hook! Thou old traitor,\n"+
		"I am sorry that by hanging thee I can\n"+
		"But shorten thy life one week. And thou, fresh piece\n"+
		"Of excellent witchcraft, who of force must know\n"+
		"The royal fool thou copest with,--\n"+
		"Shepherd\n"+
		"O, my heart!\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"I'll have thy beauty scratch'd with briers, and made\n"+
		"More homely than thy state. For thee, fond boy,\n"+
		"If I may ever know thou dost but sigh\n"+
		"That thou no more shalt see this knack, as never\n"+
		"I mean thou shalt, we'll bar thee from succession;\n"+
		"Not hold thee of our blood, no, not our kin,\n"+
		"Far than Deucalion off: mark thou my words:\n"+
		"Follow us to the court. Thou churl, for this time,\n"+
		"Though full of our displeasure, yet we free thee\n"+
		"From the dead blow of it. And you, enchantment.--\n"+
		"Worthy enough a herdsman: yea, him too,\n"+
		"That makes himself, but for our honour therein,\n"+
		"Unworthy thee,--if ever henceforth thou\n"+
		"These rural latches to his entrance open,\n"+
		"Or hoop his body more with thy embraces,\n"+
		"I will devise a death as cruel for thee\n"+
		"As thou art tender to't.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"PERDITA\n"+
		"Even here undone!\n"+
		"I was not much afeard; for once or twice\n"+
		"I was about to speak and tell him plainly,\n"+
		"The selfsame sun that shines upon his court\n"+
		"Hides not his visage from our cottage but\n"+
		"Looks on alike. Will't please you, sir, be gone?\n"+
		"I told you what would come of this: beseech you,\n"+
		"Of your own state take care: this dream of mine,--\n"+
		"Being now awake, I'll queen it no inch farther,\n"+
		"But milk my ewes and weep.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"Why, how now, father!\n"+
		"Speak ere thou diest.\n"+
		"Shepherd\n"+
		"I cannot speak, nor think\n"+
		"Nor dare to know that which I know. O sir!\n"+
		"You have undone a man of fourscore three,\n"+
		"That thought to fill his grave in quiet, yea,\n"+
		"To die upon the bed my father died,\n"+
		"To lie close by his honest bones: but now\n"+
		"Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me\n"+
		"Where no priest shovels in dust. O cursed wretch,\n"+
		"That knew'st this was the prince,\n"+
		"and wouldst adventure\n"+
		"To mingle faith with him! Undone! undone!\n"+
		"If I might die within this hour, I have lived\n"+
		"To die when I desire.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"FLORIZEL\n"+
		"Why look you so upon me?\n"+
		"I am but sorry, not afeard; delay'd,\n"+
		"But nothing alter'd: what I was, I am;\n"+
		"More straining on for plucking back, not following\n"+
		"My leash unwillingly.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"Gracious my lord,\n"+
		"You know your father's temper: at this time\n"+
		"He will allow no speech, which I do guess\n"+
		"You do not purpose to him; and as hardly\n"+
		"Will he endure your sight as yet, I fear:\n"+
		"Then, till the fury of his highness settle,\n"+
		"Come not before him.\n"+
		"FLORIZEL\n"+
		"I not purpose it.\n"+
		"I think, Camillo?\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"Even he, my lord.\n"+
		"PERDITA\n"+
		"How often have I told you 'twould be thus!\n"+
		"How often said, my dignity would last\n"+
		"But till 'twere known!\n"+
		"FLORIZEL\n"+
		"It cannot fail but by\n"+
		"The violation of my faith; and then\n"+
		"Let nature crush the sides o' the earth together\n"+
		"And mar the seeds within! Lift up thy looks:\n"+
		"From my succession wipe me, father; I\n"+
		"Am heir to my affection.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"Be advised.\n"+
		"FLORIZEL\n"+
		"I am, and by my fancy: if my reason\n"+
		"Will thereto be obedient, I have reason;\n"+
		"If not, my senses, better pleased with madness,\n"+
		"Do bid it welcome.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"This is desperate, sir.\n"+
		"FLORIZEL\n"+
		"So call it: but it does fulfil my vow;\n"+
		"I needs must think it honesty. Camillo,\n"+
		"Not for Bohemia, nor the pomp that may\n"+
		"Be thereat glean'd, for all the sun sees or\n"+
		"The close earth wombs or the profound sea hides\n"+
		"In unknown fathoms, will I break my oath\n"+
		"To this my fair beloved: therefore, I pray you,\n"+
		"As you have ever been my father's honour'd friend,\n"+
		"When he shall miss me,--as, in faith, I mean not\n"+
		"To see him any more,--cast your good counsels\n"+
		"Upon his passion; let myself and fortune\n"+
		"Tug for the time to come. This you may know\n"+
		"And so deliver, I am put to sea\n"+
		"With her whom here I cannot hold on shore;\n"+
		"And most opportune to our need I have\n"+
		"A vessel rides fast by, but not prepared\n"+
		"For this design. What course I mean to hold\n"+
		"Shall nothing benefit your knowledge, nor\n"+
		"Concern me the reporting.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"O my lord!\n"+
		"I would your spirit were easier for advice,\n"+
		"Or stronger for your need.\n"+
		"FLORIZEL\n"+
		"Hark, Perdita\n"+
		"Drawing her aside\n"+
		"I'll hear you by and by.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"He's irremoveable,\n"+
		"Resolved for flight. Now were I happy, if\n"+
		"His going I could frame to serve my turn,\n"+
		"Save him from danger, do him love and honour,\n"+
		"Purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia\n"+
		"And that unhappy king, my master, whom\n"+
		"I so much thirst to see.\n"+
		"FLORIZEL\n"+
		"Now, good Camillo;\n"+
		"I am so fraught with curious business that\n"+
		"I leave out ceremony.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"Sir, I think\n"+
		"You have heard of my poor services, i' the love\n"+
		"That I have borne your father?\n"+
		"FLORIZEL\n"+
		"Very nobly\n"+
		"Have you deserved: it is my father's music\n"+
		"To speak your deeds, not little of his care\n"+
		"To have them recompensed as thought on.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"Well, my lord,\n"+
		"If you may please to think I love the king\n"+
		"And through him what is nearest to him, which is\n"+
		"Your gracious self, embrace but my direction:\n"+
		"If your more ponderous and settled project\n"+
		"May suffer alteration, on mine honour,\n"+
		"I'll point you where you shall have such receiving\n"+
		"As shall become your highness; where you may\n"+
		"Enjoy your mistress, from the whom, I see,\n"+
		"There's no disjunction to be made, but by--\n"+
		"As heavens forefend!--your ruin; marry her,\n"+
		"And, with my best endeavours in your absence,\n"+
		"Your discontenting father strive to qualify\n"+
		"And bring him up to liking.\n"+
		"FLORIZEL\n"+
		"How, Camillo,\n"+
		"May this, almost a miracle, be done?\n"+
		"That I may call thee something more than man\n"+
		"And after that trust to thee.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"Have you thought on\n"+
		"A place whereto you'll go?\n"+
		"FLORIZEL\n"+
		"Not any yet:\n"+
		"But as the unthought-on accident is guilty\n"+
		"To what we wildly do, so we profess\n"+
		"Ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies\n"+
		"Of every wind that blows.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"Then list to me:\n"+
		"This follows, if you will not change your purpose\n"+
		"But undergo this flight, make for Sicilia,\n"+
		"And there present yourself and your fair princess,\n"+
		"For so I see she must be, 'fore Leontes:\n"+
		"She shall be habited as it becomes\n"+
		"The partner of your bed. Methinks I see\n"+
		"Leontes opening his free arms and weeping\n"+
		"His welcomes forth; asks thee the son forgiveness,\n"+
		"As 'twere i' the father's person; kisses the hands\n"+
		"Of your fresh princess; o'er and o'er divides him\n"+
		"'Twixt his unkindness and his kindness; the one\n"+
		"He chides to hell and bids the other grow\n"+
		"Faster than thought or time.\n"+
		"FLORIZEL\n"+
		"Worthy Camillo,\n"+
		"What colour for my visitation shall I\n"+
		"Hold up before him?\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"Sent by the king your father\n"+
		"To greet him and to give him comforts. Sir,\n"+
		"The manner of your bearing towards him, with\n"+
		"What you as from your father shall deliver,\n"+
		"Things known betwixt us three, I'll write you down:\n"+
		"The which shall point you forth at every sitting\n"+
		"What you must say; that he shall not perceive\n"+
		"But that you have your father's bosom there\n"+
		"And speak his very heart.\n"+
		"FLORIZEL\n"+
		"I am bound to you:\n"+
		"There is some sap in this.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"A cause more promising\n"+
		"Than a wild dedication of yourselves\n"+
		"To unpath'd waters, undream'd shores, most certain\n"+
		"To miseries enough; no hope to help you,\n"+
		"But as you shake off one to take another;\n"+
		"Nothing so certain as your anchors, who\n"+
		"Do their best office, if they can but stay you\n"+
		"Where you'll be loath to be: besides you know\n"+
		"Prosperity's the very bond of love,\n"+
		"Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together\n"+
		"Affliction alters.\n"+
		"PERDITA\n"+
		"One of these is true:\n"+
		"I think affliction may subdue the cheek,\n"+
		"But not take in the mind.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"Yea, say you so?\n"+
		"There shall not at your father's house these\n"+
		"seven years\n"+
		"Be born another such.\n"+
		"FLORIZEL\n"+
		"My good Camillo,\n"+
		"She is as forward of her breeding as\n"+
		"She is i' the rear our birth.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"I cannot say 'tis pity\n"+
		"She lacks instructions, for she seems a mistress\n"+
		"To most that teach.\n"+
		"PERDITA\n"+
		"Your pardon, sir; for this\n"+
		"I'll blush you thanks.\n"+
		"FLORIZEL\n"+
		"My prettiest Perdita!\n"+
		"But O, the thorns we stand upon! Camillo,\n"+
		"Preserver of my father, now of me,\n"+
		"The medicine of our house, how shall we do?\n"+
		"We are not furnish'd like Bohemia's son,\n"+
		"Nor shall appear in Sicilia.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"My lord,\n"+
		"Fear none of this: I think you know my fortunes\n"+
		"Do all lie there: it shall be so my care\n"+
		"To have you royally appointed as if\n"+
		"The scene you play were mine. For instance, sir,\n"+
		"That you may know you shall not want, one word.\n"+
		"They talk aside\n"+
		"Re-enter AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"Ha, ha! what a fool Honesty is! and Trust, his\n"+
		"sworn brother, a very simple gentleman! I have sold\n"+
		"all my trumpery; not a counterfeit stone, not a\n"+
		"ribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table-book, ballad,\n"+
		"knife, tape, glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring,\n"+
		"to keep my pack from fasting: they throng who\n"+
		"should buy first, as if my trinkets had been\n"+
		"hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer:\n"+
		"by which means I saw whose purse was best in\n"+
		"picture; and what I saw, to my good use I\n"+
		"remembered. My clown, who wants but something to\n"+
		"be a reasonable man, grew so in love with the\n"+
		"wenches' song, that he would not stir his pettitoes\n"+
		"till he had both tune and words; which so drew the\n"+
		"rest of the herd to me that all their other senses\n"+
		"stuck in ears: you might have pinched a placket, it\n"+
		"was senseless; 'twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a\n"+
		"purse; I could have filed keys off that hung in\n"+
		"chains: no hearing, no feeling, but my sir's song,\n"+
		"and admiring the nothing of it. So that in this\n"+
		"time of lethargy I picked and cut most of their\n"+
		"festival purses; and had not the old man come in\n"+
		"with a whoo-bub against his daughter and the king's\n"+
		"son and scared my choughs from the chaff, I had not\n"+
		"left a purse alive in the whole army.\n"+
		"CAMILLO, FLORIZEL, and PERDITA come forward\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"Nay, but my letters, by this means being there\n"+
		"So soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt.\n"+
		"FLORIZEL\n"+
		"And those that you'll procure from King Leontes--\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"Shall satisfy your father.\n"+
		"PERDITA\n"+
		"Happy be you!\n"+
		"All that you speak shows fair.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"Who have we here?\n"+
		"Seeing AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"We'll make an instrument of this, omit\n"+
		"Nothing may give us aid.\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"If they have overheard me now, why, hanging.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"How now, good fellow! why shakest thou so? Fear\n"+
		"not, man; here's no harm intended to thee.\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"I am a poor fellow, sir.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"Why, be so still; here's nobody will steal that from\n"+
		"thee: yet for the outside of thy poverty we must\n"+
		"make an exchange; therefore discase thee instantly,\n"+
		"--thou must think there's a necessity in't,--and\n"+
		"change garments with this gentleman: though the\n"+
		"pennyworth on his side be the worst, yet hold thee,\n"+
		"there's some boot.\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"I am a poor fellow, sir.\n"+
		"Aside\n"+
		"I know ye well enough.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"Nay, prithee, dispatch: the gentleman is half\n"+
		"flayed already.\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"Are you in earnest, sir?\n"+
		"Aside\n"+
		"I smell the trick on't.\n"+
		"FLORIZEL\n"+
		"Dispatch, I prithee.\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"Indeed, I have had earnest: but I cannot with\n"+
		"conscience take it.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"Unbuckle, unbuckle.\n"+
		"FLORIZEL and AUTOLYCUS exchange garments\n"+
		"Fortunate mistress,--let my prophecy\n"+
		"Come home to ye!--you must retire yourself\n"+
		"Into some covert: take your sweetheart's hat\n"+
		"And pluck it o'er your brows, muffle your face,\n"+
		"Dismantle you, and, as you can, disliken\n"+
		"The truth of your own seeming; that you may--\n"+
		"For I do fear eyes over--to shipboard\n"+
		"Get undescried.\n"+
		"PERDITA\n"+
		"I see the play so lies\n"+
		"That I must bear a part.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"No remedy.\n"+
		"Have you done there?\n"+
		"FLORIZEL\n"+
		"Should I now meet my father,\n"+
		"He would not call me son.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"Nay, you shall have no hat.\n"+
		"Giving it to PERDITA\n"+
		"Come, lady, come. Farewell, my friend.\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"Adieu, sir.\n"+
		"FLORIZEL\n"+
		"O Perdita, what have we twain forgot!\n"+
		"Pray you, a word.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"[Aside] What I do next, shall be to tell the king\n"+
		"Of this escape and whither they are bound;\n"+
		"Wherein my hope is I shall so prevail\n"+
		"To force him after: in whose company\n"+
		"I shall review Sicilia, for whose sight\n"+
		"I have a woman's longing.\n"+
		"FLORIZEL\n"+
		"Fortune speed us!\n"+
		"Thus we set on, Camillo, to the sea-side.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"The swifter speed the better.\n"+
		"Exeunt FLORIZEL, PERDITA, and CAMILLO\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"I understand the business, I hear it: to have an\n"+
		"open ear, a quick eye, and a nimble hand, is\n"+
		"necessary for a cut-purse; a good nose is requisite\n"+
		"also, to smell out work for the other senses. I see\n"+
		"this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive.\n"+
		"What an exchange had this been without boot! What\n"+
		"a boot is here with this exchange! Sure the gods do\n"+
		"this year connive at us, and we may do any thing\n"+
		"extempore. The prince himself is about a piece of\n"+
		"iniquity, stealing away from his father with his\n"+
		"clog at his heels: if I thought it were a piece of\n"+
		"honesty to acquaint the king withal, I would not\n"+
		"do't: I hold it the more knavery to conceal it;\n"+
		"and therein am I constant to my profession.\n"+
		"Re-enter Clown and Shepherd\n"+
		"Aside, aside; here is more matter for a hot brain:\n"+
		"every lane's end, every shop, church, session,\n"+
		"hanging, yields a careful man work.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"See, see; what a man you are now!\n"+
		"There is no other way but to tell the king\n"+
		"she's a changeling and none of your flesh and blood.\n"+
		"Shepherd\n"+
		"Nay, but hear me.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Nay, but hear me.\n"+
		"Shepherd\n"+
		"Go to, then.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"She being none of your flesh and blood, your flesh\n"+
		"and blood has not offended the king; and so your\n"+
		"flesh and blood is not to be punished by him. Show\n"+
		"those things you found about her, those secret\n"+
		"things, all but what she has with her: this being\n"+
		"done, let the law go whistle: I warrant you.\n"+
		"Shepherd\n"+
		"I will tell the king all, every word, yea, and his\n"+
		"son's pranks too; who, I may say, is no honest man,\n"+
		"neither to his father nor to me, to go about to make\n"+
		"me the king's brother-in-law.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Indeed, brother-in-law was the farthest off you\n"+
		"could have been to him and then your blood had been\n"+
		"the dearer by I know how much an ounce.\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"[Aside] Very wisely, puppies!\n"+
		"Shepherd\n"+
		"Well, let us to the king: there is that in this\n"+
		"fardel will make him scratch his beard.\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"[Aside] I know not what impediment this complaint\n"+
		"may be to the flight of my master.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Pray heartily he be at palace.\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"[Aside] Though I am not naturally honest, I am so\n"+
		"sometimes by chance: let me pocket up my pedlar's excrement.\n"+
		"Takes off his false beard\n"+
		"How now, rustics! whither are you bound?\n"+
		"Shepherd\n"+
		"To the palace, an it like your worship.\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"Your affairs there, what, with whom, the condition\n"+
		"of that fardel, the place of your dwelling, your\n"+
		"names, your ages, of what having, breeding, and any\n"+
		"thing that is fitting to be known, discover.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"We are but plain fellows, sir.\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"A lie; you are rough and hairy. Let me have no\n"+
		"lying: it becomes none but tradesmen, and they\n"+
		"often give us soldiers the lie: but we pay them for\n"+
		"it with stamped coin, not stabbing steel; therefore\n"+
		"they do not give us the lie.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Your worship had like to have given us one, if you\n"+
		"had not taken yourself with the manner.\n"+
		"Shepherd\n"+
		"Are you a courtier, an't like you, sir?\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"Whether it like me or no, I am a courtier. Seest\n"+
		"thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings?\n"+
		"hath not my gait in it the measure of the court?\n"+
		"receives not thy nose court-odor from me? reflect I\n"+
		"not on thy baseness court-contempt? Thinkest thou,\n"+
		"for that I insinuate, or toaze from thee thy\n"+
		"business, I am therefore no courtier? I am courtier\n"+
		"cap-a-pe; and one that will either push on or pluck\n"+
		"back thy business there: whereupon I command thee to\n"+
		"open thy affair.\n"+
		"Shepherd\n"+
		"My business, sir, is to the king.\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"What advocate hast thou to him?\n"+
		"Shepherd\n"+
		"I know not, an't like you.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Advocate's the court-word for a pheasant: say you\n"+
		"have none.\n"+
		"Shepherd\n"+
		"None, sir; I have no pheasant, cock nor hen.\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"How blessed are we that are not simple men!\n"+
		"Yet nature might have made me as these are,\n"+
		"Therefore I will not disdain.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"This cannot be but a great courtier.\n"+
		"Shepherd\n"+
		"His garments are rich, but he wears\n"+
		"them not handsomely.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"He seems to be the more noble in being fantastical:\n"+
		"a great man, I'll warrant; I know by the picking\n"+
		"on's teeth.\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"The fardel there? what's i' the fardel?\n"+
		"Wherefore that box?\n"+
		"Shepherd\n"+
		"Sir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and box,\n"+
		"which none must know but the king; and which he\n"+
		"shall know within this hour, if I may come to the\n"+
		"speech of him.\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"Age, thou hast lost thy labour.\n"+
		"Shepherd\n"+
		"Why, sir?\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"The king is not at the palace; he is gone aboard a\n"+
		"new ship to purge melancholy and air himself: for,\n"+
		"if thou beest capable of things serious, thou must\n"+
		"know the king is full of grief.\n"+
		"Shepard\n"+
		"So 'tis said, sir; about his son, that should have\n"+
		"married a shepherd's daughter.\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"If that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him fly:\n"+
		"the curses he shall have, the tortures he shall\n"+
		"feel, will break the back of man, the heart of monster.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Think you so, sir?\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy\n"+
		"and vengeance bitter; but those that are germane to\n"+
		"him, though removed fifty times, shall all come\n"+
		"under the hangman: which though it be great pity,\n"+
		"yet it is necessary. An old sheep-whistling rogue a\n"+
		"ram-tender, to offer to have his daughter come into\n"+
		"grace! Some say he shall be stoned; but that death\n"+
		"is too soft for him, say I draw our throne into a\n"+
		"sheep-cote! all deaths are too few, the sharpest too easy.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Has the old man e'er a son, sir, do you hear. an't\n"+
		"like you, sir?\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"He has a son, who shall be flayed alive; then\n"+
		"'nointed over with honey, set on the head of a\n"+
		"wasp's nest; then stand till he be three quarters\n"+
		"and a dram dead; then recovered again with\n"+
		"aqua-vitae or some other hot infusion; then, raw as\n"+
		"he is, and in the hottest day prognostication\n"+
		"proclaims, shall be be set against a brick-wall, the\n"+
		"sun looking with a southward eye upon him, where he\n"+
		"is to behold him with flies blown to death. But what\n"+
		"talk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseries\n"+
		"are to be smiled at, their offences being so\n"+
		"capital? Tell me, for you seem to be honest plain\n"+
		"men, what you have to the king: being something\n"+
		"gently considered, I'll bring you where he is\n"+
		"aboard, tender your persons to his presence,\n"+
		"whisper him in your behalfs; and if it be in man\n"+
		"besides the king to effect your suits, here is man\n"+
		"shall do it.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"He seems to be of great authority: close with him,\n"+
		"give him gold; and though authority be a stubborn\n"+
		"bear, yet he is oft led by the nose with gold: show\n"+
		"the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand,\n"+
		"and no more ado. Remember 'stoned,' and 'flayed alive.'\n"+
		"Shepherd\n"+
		"An't please you, sir, to undertake the business for\n"+
		"us, here is that gold I have: I'll make it as much\n"+
		"more and leave this young man in pawn till I bring it you.\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"After I have done what I promised?\n"+
		"Shepherd\n"+
		"Ay, sir.\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"Well, give me the moiety. Are you a party in this business?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"In some sort, sir: but though my case be a pitiful\n"+
		"one, I hope I shall not be flayed out of it.\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"O, that's the case of the shepherd's son: hang him,\n"+
		"he'll be made an example.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Comfort, good comfort! We must to the king and show\n"+
		"our strange sights: he must know 'tis none of your\n"+
		"daughter nor my sister; we are gone else. Sir, I\n"+
		"will give you as much as this old man does when the\n"+
		"business is performed, and remain, as he says, your\n"+
		"pawn till it be brought you.\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"I will trust you. Walk before toward the sea-side;\n"+
		"go on the right hand: I will but look upon the\n"+
		"hedge and follow you.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"We are blest in this man, as I may say, even blest.\n"+
		"Shepherd\n"+
		"Let's before as he bids us: he was provided to do us good.\n"+
		"Exeunt Shepherd and Clown\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"If I had a mind to be honest, I see Fortune would\n"+
		"not suffer me: she drops booties in my mouth. I am\n"+
		"courted now with a double occasion, gold and a means\n"+
		"to do the prince my master good; which who knows how\n"+
		"that may turn back to my advancement? I will bring\n"+
		"these two moles, these blind ones, aboard him: if he\n"+
		"think it fit to shore them again and that the\n"+
		"complaint they have to the king concerns him\n"+
		"nothing, let him call me rogue for being so far\n"+
		"officious; for I am proof against that title and\n"+
		"what shame else belongs to't. To him will I present\n"+
		"them: there may be matter in it.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"ACT V\n"+
		"SCENE I. A room in LEONTES' palace.\n"+
		"Enter LEONTES, CLEOMENES, DION, PAULINA, and Servants\n"+
		"CLEOMENES\n"+
		"Sir, you have done enough, and have perform'd\n"+
		"A saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make,\n"+
		"Which you have not redeem'd; indeed, paid down\n"+
		"More penitence than done trespass: at the last,\n"+
		"Do as the heavens have done, forget your evil;\n"+
		"With them forgive yourself.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Whilst I remember\n"+
		"Her and her virtues, I cannot forget\n"+
		"My blemishes in them, and so still think of\n"+
		"The wrong I did myself; which was so much,\n"+
		"That heirless it hath made my kingdom and\n"+
		"Destroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er man\n"+
		"Bred his hopes out of.\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"True, too true, my lord:\n"+
		"If, one by one, you wedded all the world,\n"+
		"Or from the all that are took something good,\n"+
		"To make a perfect woman, she you kill'd\n"+
		"Would be unparallel'd.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"I think so. Kill'd!\n"+
		"She I kill'd! I did so: but thou strikest me\n"+
		"Sorely, to say I did; it is as bitter\n"+
		"Upon thy tongue as in my thought: now, good now,\n"+
		"Say so but seldom.\n"+
		"CLEOMENES\n"+
		"Not at all, good lady:\n"+
		"You might have spoken a thousand things that would\n"+
		"Have done the time more benefit and graced\n"+
		"Your kindness better.\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"You are one of those\n"+
		"Would have him wed again.\n"+
		"DION\n"+
		"If you would not so,\n"+
		"You pity not the state, nor the remembrance\n"+
		"Of his most sovereign name; consider little\n"+
		"What dangers, by his highness' fail of issue,\n"+
		"May drop upon his kingdom and devour\n"+
		"Incertain lookers on. What were more holy\n"+
		"Than to rejoice the former queen is well?\n"+
		"What holier than, for royalty's repair,\n"+
		"For present comfort and for future good,\n"+
		"To bless the bed of majesty again\n"+
		"With a sweet fellow to't?\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"There is none worthy,\n"+
		"Respecting her that's gone. Besides, the gods\n"+
		"Will have fulfill'd their secret purposes;\n"+
		"For has not the divine Apollo said,\n"+
		"Is't not the tenor of his oracle,\n"+
		"That King Leontes shall not have an heir\n"+
		"Till his lost child be found? which that it shall,\n"+
		"Is all as monstrous to our human reason\n"+
		"As my Antigonus to break his grave\n"+
		"And come again to me; who, on my life,\n"+
		"Did perish with the infant. 'Tis your counsel\n"+
		"My lord should to the heavens be contrary,\n"+
		"Oppose against their wills.\n"+
		"To LEONTES\n"+
		"Care not for issue;\n"+
		"The crown will find an heir: great Alexander\n"+
		"Left his to the worthiest; so his successor\n"+
		"Was like to be the best.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Good Paulina,\n"+
		"Who hast the memory of Hermione,\n"+
		"I know, in honour, O, that ever I\n"+
		"Had squared me to thy counsel! then, even now,\n"+
		"I might have look'd upon my queen's full eyes,\n"+
		"Have taken treasure from her lips--\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"And left them\n"+
		"More rich for what they yielded.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Thou speak'st truth.\n"+
		"No more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse,\n"+
		"And better used, would make her sainted spirit\n"+
		"Again possess her corpse, and on this stage,\n"+
		"Where we're offenders now, appear soul-vex'd,\n"+
		"And begin, 'Why to me?'\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"Had she such power,\n"+
		"She had just cause.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"She had; and would incense me\n"+
		"To murder her I married.\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"I should so.\n"+
		"Were I the ghost that walk'd, I'ld bid you mark\n"+
		"Her eye, and tell me for what dull part in't\n"+
		"You chose her; then I'ld shriek, that even your ears\n"+
		"Should rift to hear me; and the words that follow'd\n"+
		"Should be 'Remember mine.'\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Stars, stars,\n"+
		"And all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou no wife;\n"+
		"I'll have no wife, Paulina.\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"Will you swear\n"+
		"Never to marry but by my free leave?\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Never, Paulina; so be blest my spirit!\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"Then, good my lords, bear witness to his oath.\n"+
		"CLEOMENES\n"+
		"You tempt him over-much.\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"Unless another,\n"+
		"As like Hermione as is her picture,\n"+
		"Affront his eye.\n"+
		"CLEOMENES\n"+
		"Good madam,--\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"I have done.\n"+
		"Yet, if my lord will marry,--if you will, sir,\n"+
		"No remedy, but you will,--give me the office\n"+
		"To choose you a queen: she shall not be so young\n"+
		"As was your former; but she shall be such\n"+
		"As, walk'd your first queen's ghost,\n"+
		"it should take joy\n"+
		"To see her in your arms.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"My true Paulina,\n"+
		"We shall not marry till thou bid'st us.\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"That\n"+
		"Shall be when your first queen's again in breath;\n"+
		"Never till then.\n"+
		"Enter a Gentleman\n"+
		"Gentleman\n"+
		"One that gives out himself Prince Florizel,\n"+
		"Son of Polixenes, with his princess, she\n"+
		"The fairest I have yet beheld, desires access\n"+
		"To your high presence.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"What with him? he comes not\n"+
		"Like to his father's greatness: his approach,\n"+
		"So out of circumstance and sudden, tells us\n"+
		"'Tis not a visitation framed, but forced\n"+
		"By need and accident. What train?\n"+
		"Gentleman\n"+
		"But few,\n"+
		"And those but mean.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"His princess, say you, with him?\n"+
		"Gentleman\n"+
		"Ay, the most peerless piece of earth, I think,\n"+
		"That e'er the sun shone bright on.\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"O Hermione,\n"+
		"As every present time doth boast itself\n"+
		"Above a better gone, so must thy grave\n"+
		"Give way to what's seen now! Sir, you yourself\n"+
		"Have said and writ so, but your writing now\n"+
		"Is colder than that theme, 'She had not been,\n"+
		"Nor was not to be equall'd;'--thus your verse\n"+
		"Flow'd with her beauty once: 'tis shrewdly ebb'd,\n"+
		"To say you have seen a better.\n"+
		"Gentleman\n"+
		"Pardon, madam:\n"+
		"The one I have almost forgot,--your pardon,--\n"+
		"The other, when she has obtain'd your eye,\n"+
		"Will have your tongue too. This is a creature,\n"+
		"Would she begin a sect, might quench the zeal\n"+
		"Of all professors else, make proselytes\n"+
		"Of who she but bid follow.\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"How! not women?\n"+
		"Gentleman\n"+
		"Women will love her, that she is a woman\n"+
		"More worth than any man; men, that she is\n"+
		"The rarest of all women.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Go, Cleomenes;\n"+
		"Yourself, assisted with your honour'd friends,\n"+
		"Bring them to our embracement. Still, 'tis strange\n"+
		"Exeunt CLEOMENES and others\n"+
		"He thus should steal upon us.\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"Had our prince,\n"+
		"Jewel of children, seen this hour, he had pair'd\n"+
		"Well with this lord: there was not full a month\n"+
		"Between their births.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Prithee, no more; cease; thou know'st\n"+
		"He dies to me again when talk'd of: sure,\n"+
		"When I shall see this gentleman, thy speeches\n"+
		"Will bring me to consider that which may\n"+
		"Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.\n"+
		"Re-enter CLEOMENES and others, with FLORIZEL and PERDITA\n"+
		"Your mother was most true to wedlock, prince;\n"+
		"For she did print your royal father off,\n"+
		"Conceiving you: were I but twenty-one,\n"+
		"Your father's image is so hit in you,\n"+
		"His very air, that I should call you brother,\n"+
		"As I did him, and speak of something wildly\n"+
		"By us perform'd before. Most dearly welcome!\n"+
		"And your fair princess,--goddess!--O, alas!\n"+
		"I lost a couple, that 'twixt heaven and earth\n"+
		"Might thus have stood begetting wonder as\n"+
		"You, gracious couple, do: and then I lost--\n"+
		"All mine own folly--the society,\n"+
		"Amity too, of your brave father, whom,\n"+
		"Though bearing misery, I desire my life\n"+
		"Once more to look on him.\n"+
		"FLORIZEL\n"+
		"By his command\n"+
		"Have I here touch'd Sicilia and from him\n"+
		"Give you all greetings that a king, at friend,\n"+
		"Can send his brother: and, but infirmity\n"+
		"Which waits upon worn times hath something seized\n"+
		"His wish'd ability, he had himself\n"+
		"The lands and waters 'twixt your throne and his\n"+
		"Measured to look upon you; whom he loves--\n"+
		"He bade me say so--more than all the sceptres\n"+
		"And those that bear them living.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"O my brother,\n"+
		"Good gentleman! the wrongs I have done thee stir\n"+
		"Afresh within me, and these thy offices,\n"+
		"So rarely kind, are as interpreters\n"+
		"Of my behind-hand slackness. Welcome hither,\n"+
		"As is the spring to the earth. And hath he too\n"+
		"Exposed this paragon to the fearful usage,\n"+
		"At least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune,\n"+
		"To greet a man not worth her pains, much less\n"+
		"The adventure of her person?\n"+
		"FLORIZEL\n"+
		"Good my lord,\n"+
		"She came from Libya.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Where the warlike Smalus,\n"+
		"That noble honour'd lord, is fear'd and loved?\n"+
		"FLORIZEL\n"+
		"Most royal sir, from thence; from him, whose daughter\n"+
		"His tears proclaim'd his, parting with her: thence,\n"+
		"A prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross'd,\n"+
		"To execute the charge my father gave me\n"+
		"For visiting your highness: my best train\n"+
		"I have from your Sicilian shores dismiss'd;\n"+
		"Who for Bohemia bend, to signify\n"+
		"Not only my success in Libya, sir,\n"+
		"But my arrival and my wife's in safety\n"+
		"Here where we are.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"The blessed gods\n"+
		"Purge all infection from our air whilst you\n"+
		"Do climate here! You have a holy father,\n"+
		"A graceful gentleman; against whose person,\n"+
		"So sacred as it is, I have done sin:\n"+
		"For which the heavens, taking angry note,\n"+
		"Have left me issueless; and your father's blest,\n"+
		"As he from heaven merits it, with you\n"+
		"Worthy his goodness. What might I have been,\n"+
		"Might I a son and daughter now have look'd on,\n"+
		"Such goodly things as you!\n"+
		"Enter a Lord\n"+
		"Lord\n"+
		"Most noble sir,\n"+
		"That which I shall report will bear no credit,\n"+
		"Were not the proof so nigh. Please you, great sir,\n"+
		"Bohemia greets you from himself by me;\n"+
		"Desires you to attach his son, who has--\n"+
		"His dignity and duty both cast off--\n"+
		"Fled from his father, from his hopes, and with\n"+
		"A shepherd's daughter.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Where's Bohemia? speak.\n"+
		"Lord\n"+
		"Here in your city; I now came from him:\n"+
		"I speak amazedly; and it becomes\n"+
		"My marvel and my message. To your court\n"+
		"Whiles he was hastening, in the chase, it seems,\n"+
		"Of this fair couple, meets he on the way\n"+
		"The father of this seeming lady and\n"+
		"Her brother, having both their country quitted\n"+
		"With this young prince.\n"+
		"FLORIZEL\n"+
		"Camillo has betray'd me;\n"+
		"Whose honour and whose honesty till now\n"+
		"Endured all weathers.\n"+
		"Lord\n"+
		"Lay't so to his charge:\n"+
		"He's with the king your father.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Who? Camillo?\n"+
		"Lord\n"+
		"Camillo, sir; I spake with him; who now\n"+
		"Has these poor men in question. Never saw I\n"+
		"Wretches so quake: they kneel, they kiss the earth;\n"+
		"Forswear themselves as often as they speak:\n"+
		"Bohemia stops his ears, and threatens them\n"+
		"With divers deaths in death.\n"+
		"PERDITA\n"+
		"O my poor father!\n"+
		"The heaven sets spies upon us, will not have\n"+
		"Our contract celebrated.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"You are married?\n"+
		"FLORIZEL\n"+
		"We are not, sir, nor are we like to be;\n"+
		"The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first:\n"+
		"The odds for high and low's alike.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"My lord,\n"+
		"Is this the daughter of a king?\n"+
		"FLORIZEL\n"+
		"She is,\n"+
		"When once she is my wife.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"That 'once' I see by your good father's speed\n"+
		"Will come on very slowly. I am sorry,\n"+
		"Most sorry, you have broken from his liking\n"+
		"Where you were tied in duty, and as sorry\n"+
		"Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty,\n"+
		"That you might well enjoy her.\n"+
		"FLORIZEL\n"+
		"Dear, look up:\n"+
		"Though Fortune, visible an enemy,\n"+
		"Should chase us with my father, power no jot\n"+
		"Hath she to change our loves. Beseech you, sir,\n"+
		"Remember since you owed no more to time\n"+
		"Than I do now: with thought of such affections,\n"+
		"Step forth mine advocate; at your request\n"+
		"My father will grant precious things as trifles.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Would he do so, I'ld beg your precious mistress,\n"+
		"Which he counts but a trifle.\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"Sir, my liege,\n"+
		"Your eye hath too much youth in't: not a month\n"+
		"'Fore your queen died, she was more worth such gazes\n"+
		"Than what you look on now.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"I thought of her,\n"+
		"Even in these looks I made.\n"+
		"To FLORIZEL\n"+
		"But your petition\n"+
		"Is yet unanswer'd. I will to your father:\n"+
		"Your honour not o'erthrown by your desires,\n"+
		"I am friend to them and you: upon which errand\n"+
		"I now go toward him; therefore follow me\n"+
		"And mark what way I make: come, good my lord.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. Before LEONTES' palace.\n"+
		"Enter AUTOLYCUS and a Gentleman\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"Beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?\n"+
		"First Gentleman\n"+
		"I was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old\n"+
		"shepherd deliver the manner how he found it:\n"+
		"whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all\n"+
		"commanded out of the chamber; only this methought I\n"+
		"heard the shepherd say, he found the child.\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"I would most gladly know the issue of it.\n"+
		"First Gentleman\n"+
		"I make a broken delivery of the business; but the\n"+
		"changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were\n"+
		"very notes of admiration: they seemed almost, with\n"+
		"staring on one another, to tear the cases of their\n"+
		"eyes; there was speech in their dumbness, language\n"+
		"in their very gesture; they looked as they had heard\n"+
		"of a world ransomed, or one destroyed: a notable\n"+
		"passion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest\n"+
		"beholder, that knew no more but seeing, could not\n"+
		"say if the importance were joy or sorrow; but in the\n"+
		"extremity of the one, it must needs be.\n"+
		"Enter another Gentleman\n"+
		"Here comes a gentleman that haply knows more.\n"+
		"The news, Rogero?\n"+
		"Second Gentleman\n"+
		"Nothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled; the\n"+
		"king's daughter is found: such a deal of wonder is\n"+
		"broken out within this hour that ballad-makers\n"+
		"cannot be able to express it.\n"+
		"Enter a third Gentleman\n"+
		"Here comes the Lady Paulina's steward: he can\n"+
		"deliver you more. How goes it now, sir? this news\n"+
		"which is called true is so like an old tale, that\n"+
		"the verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the king\n"+
		"found his heir?\n"+
		"Third Gentleman\n"+
		"Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by\n"+
		"circumstance: that which you hear you'll swear you\n"+
		"see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle\n"+
		"of Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the neck of it,\n"+
		"the letters of Antigonus found with it which they\n"+
		"know to be his character, the majesty of the\n"+
		"creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection\n"+
		"of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding,\n"+
		"and many other evidences proclaim her with all\n"+
		"certainty to be the king's daughter. Did you see\n"+
		"the meeting of the two kings?\n"+
		"Second Gentleman\n"+
		"No.\n"+
		"Third Gentleman\n"+
		"Then have you lost a sight, which was to be seen,\n"+
		"cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one\n"+
		"joy crown another, so and in such manner that it\n"+
		"seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their\n"+
		"joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes,\n"+
		"holding up of hands, with countenances of such\n"+
		"distraction that they were to be known by garment,\n"+
		"not by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out of\n"+
		"himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that\n"+
		"joy were now become a loss, cries 'O, thy mother,\n"+
		"thy mother!' then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then\n"+
		"embraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his\n"+
		"daughter with clipping her; now he thanks the old\n"+
		"shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten\n"+
		"conduit of many kings' reigns. I never heard of such\n"+
		"another encounter, which lames report to follow it\n"+
		"and undoes description to do it.\n"+
		"Second Gentleman\n"+
		"What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried\n"+
		"hence the child?\n"+
		"Third Gentleman\n"+
		"Like an old tale still, which will have matter to\n"+
		"rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear\n"+
		"open. He was torn to pieces with a bear: this\n"+
		"avouches the shepherd's son; who has not only his\n"+
		"innocence, which seems much, to justify him, but a\n"+
		"handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.\n"+
		"First Gentleman\n"+
		"What became of his bark and his followers?\n"+
		"Third Gentleman\n"+
		"Wrecked the same instant of their master's death and\n"+
		"in the view of the shepherd: so that all the\n"+
		"instruments which aided to expose the child were\n"+
		"even then lost when it was found. But O, the noble\n"+
		"combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought in\n"+
		"Paulina! She had one eye declined for the loss of\n"+
		"her husband, another elevated that the oracle was\n"+
		"fulfilled: she lifted the princess from the earth,\n"+
		"and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin\n"+
		"her to her heart that she might no more be in danger\n"+
		"of losing.\n"+
		"First Gentleman\n"+
		"The dignity of this act was worth the audience of\n"+
		"kings and princes; for by such was it acted.\n"+
		"Third Gentleman\n"+
		"One of the prettiest touches of all and that which\n"+
		"angled for mine eyes, caught the water though not\n"+
		"the fish, was when, at the relation of the queen's\n"+
		"death, with the manner how she came to't bravely\n"+
		"confessed and lamented by the king, how\n"+
		"attentiveness wounded his daughter; till, from one\n"+
		"sign of dolour to another, she did, with an 'Alas,'\n"+
		"I would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure my\n"+
		"heart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed\n"+
		"colour; some swooned, all sorrowed: if all the world\n"+
		"could have seen 't, the woe had been universal.\n"+
		"First Gentleman\n"+
		"Are they returned to the court?\n"+
		"Third Gentleman\n"+
		"No: the princess hearing of her mother's statue,\n"+
		"which is in the keeping of Paulina,--a piece many\n"+
		"years in doing and now newly performed by that rare\n"+
		"Italian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself\n"+
		"eternity and could put breath into his work, would\n"+
		"beguile Nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her\n"+
		"ape: he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that\n"+
		"they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of\n"+
		"answer: thither with all greediness of affection\n"+
		"are they gone, and there they intend to sup.\n"+
		"Second Gentleman\n"+
		"I thought she had some great matter there in hand;\n"+
		"for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever\n"+
		"since the death of Hermione, visited that removed\n"+
		"house. Shall we thither and with our company piece\n"+
		"the rejoicing?\n"+
		"First Gentleman\n"+
		"Who would be thence that has the benefit of access?\n"+
		"every wink of an eye some new grace will be born:\n"+
		"our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge.\n"+
		"Let's along.\n"+
		"Exeunt Gentlemen\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me,\n"+
		"would preferment drop on my head. I brought the old\n"+
		"man and his son aboard the prince: told him I heard\n"+
		"them talk of a fardel and I know not what: but he\n"+
		"at that time, overfond of the shepherd's daughter,\n"+
		"so he then took her to be, who began to be much\n"+
		"sea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of\n"+
		"weather continuing, this mystery remained\n"+
		"undiscovered. But 'tis all one to me; for had I\n"+
		"been the finder out of this secret, it would not\n"+
		"have relished among my other discredits.\n"+
		"Enter Shepherd and Clown\n"+
		"Here come those I have done good to against my will,\n"+
		"and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune.\n"+
		"Shepherd\n"+
		"Come, boy; I am past moe children, but thy sons and\n"+
		"daughters will be all gentlemen born.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"You are well met, sir. You denied to fight with me\n"+
		"this other day, because I was no gentleman born.\n"+
		"See you these clothes? say you see them not and\n"+
		"think me still no gentleman born: you were best say\n"+
		"these robes are not gentlemen born: give me the\n"+
		"lie, do, and try whether I am not now a gentleman born.\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"I know you are now, sir, a gentleman born.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Ay, and have been so any time these four hours.\n"+
		"Shepherd\n"+
		"And so have I, boy.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"So you have: but I was a gentleman born before my\n"+
		"father; for the king's son took me by the hand, and\n"+
		"called me brother; and then the two kings called my\n"+
		"father brother; and then the prince my brother and\n"+
		"the princess my sister called my father father; and\n"+
		"so we wept, and there was the first gentleman-like\n"+
		"tears that ever we shed.\n"+
		"Shepherd\n"+
		"We may live, son, to shed many more.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Ay; or else 'twere hard luck, being in so\n"+
		"preposterous estate as we are.\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"I humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all the\n"+
		"faults I have committed to your worship and to give\n"+
		"me your good report to the prince my master.\n"+
		"Shepherd\n"+
		"Prithee, son, do; for we must be gentle, now we are\n"+
		"gentlemen.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Thou wilt amend thy life?\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"Ay, an it like your good worship.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Give me thy hand: I will swear to the prince thou\n"+
		"art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia.\n"+
		"Shepherd\n"+
		"You may say it, but not swear it.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Not swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors and\n"+
		"franklins say it, I'll swear it.\n"+
		"Shepherd\n"+
		"How if it be false, son?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"If it be ne'er so false, a true gentleman may swear\n"+
		"it in the behalf of his friend: and I'll swear to\n"+
		"the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and\n"+
		"that thou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art no\n"+
		"tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be\n"+
		"drunk: but I'll swear it, and I would thou wouldst\n"+
		"be a tall fellow of thy hands.\n"+
		"AUTOLYCUS\n"+
		"I will prove so, sir, to my power.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Ay, by any means prove a tall fellow: if I do not\n"+
		"wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk, not\n"+
		"being a tall fellow, trust me not. Hark! the kings\n"+
		"and the princes, our kindred, are going to see the\n"+
		"queen's picture. Come, follow us: we'll be thy\n"+
		"good masters.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. A chapel in PAULINA'S house.\n"+
		"Enter LEONTES, POLIXENES, FLORIZEL, PERDITA, CAMILLO, PAULINA, Lords, and Attendants\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"O grave and good Paulina, the great comfort\n"+
		"That I have had of thee!\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"What, sovereign sir,\n"+
		"I did not well I meant well. All my services\n"+
		"You have paid home: but that you have vouchsafed,\n"+
		"With your crown'd brother and these your contracted\n"+
		"Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,\n"+
		"It is a surplus of your grace, which never\n"+
		"My life may last to answer.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"O Paulina,\n"+
		"We honour you with trouble: but we came\n"+
		"To see the statue of our queen: your gallery\n"+
		"Have we pass'd through, not without much content\n"+
		"In many singularities; but we saw not\n"+
		"That which my daughter came to look upon,\n"+
		"The statue of her mother.\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"As she lived peerless,\n"+
		"So her dead likeness, I do well believe,\n"+
		"Excels whatever yet you look'd upon\n"+
		"Or hand of man hath done; therefore I keep it\n"+
		"Lonely, apart. But here it is: prepare\n"+
		"To see the life as lively mock'd as ever\n"+
		"Still sleep mock'd death: behold, and say 'tis well.\n"+
		"PAULINA draws a curtain, and discovers HERMIONE standing like a statue\n"+
		"I like your silence, it the more shows off\n"+
		"Your wonder: but yet speak; first, you, my liege,\n"+
		"Comes it not something near?\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Her natural posture!\n"+
		"Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed\n"+
		"Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she\n"+
		"In thy not chiding, for she was as tender\n"+
		"As infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina,\n"+
		"Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing\n"+
		"So aged as this seems.\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"O, not by much.\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"So much the more our carver's excellence;\n"+
		"Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her\n"+
		"As she lived now.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"As now she might have done,\n"+
		"So much to my good comfort, as it is\n"+
		"Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,\n"+
		"Even with such life of majesty, warm life,\n"+
		"As now it coldly stands, when first I woo'd her!\n"+
		"I am ashamed: does not the stone rebuke me\n"+
		"For being more stone than it? O royal piece,\n"+
		"There's magic in thy majesty, which has\n"+
		"My evils conjured to remembrance and\n"+
		"From thy admiring daughter took the spirits,\n"+
		"Standing like stone with thee.\n"+
		"PERDITA\n"+
		"And give me leave,\n"+
		"And do not say 'tis superstition, that\n"+
		"I kneel and then implore her blessing. Lady,\n"+
		"Dear queen, that ended when I but began,\n"+
		"Give me that hand of yours to kiss.\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"O, patience!\n"+
		"The statue is but newly fix'd, the colour's Not dry.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,\n"+
		"Which sixteen winters cannot blow away,\n"+
		"So many summers dry; scarce any joy\n"+
		"Did ever so long live; no sorrow\n"+
		"But kill'd itself much sooner.\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"Dear my brother,\n"+
		"Let him that was the cause of this have power\n"+
		"To take off so much grief from you as he\n"+
		"Will piece up in himself.\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"Indeed, my lord,\n"+
		"If I had thought the sight of my poor image\n"+
		"Would thus have wrought you,--for the stone is mine--\n"+
		"I'ld not have show'd it.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Do not draw the curtain.\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"No longer shall you gaze on't, lest your fancy\n"+
		"May think anon it moves.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Let be, let be.\n"+
		"Would I were dead, but that, methinks, already--\n"+
		"What was he that did make it? See, my lord,\n"+
		"Would you not deem it breathed? and that those veins\n"+
		"Did verily bear blood?\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"Masterly done:\n"+
		"The very life seems warm upon her lip.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"The fixture of her eye has motion in't,\n"+
		"As we are mock'd with art.\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"I'll draw the curtain:\n"+
		"My lord's almost so far transported that\n"+
		"He'll think anon it lives.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"O sweet Paulina,\n"+
		"Make me to think so twenty years together!\n"+
		"No settled senses of the world can match\n"+
		"The pleasure of that madness. Let 't alone.\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr'd you: but\n"+
		"I could afflict you farther.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Do, Paulina;\n"+
		"For this affliction has a taste as sweet\n"+
		"As any cordial comfort. Still, methinks,\n"+
		"There is an air comes from her: what fine chisel\n"+
		"Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,\n"+
		"For I will kiss her.\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"Good my lord, forbear:\n"+
		"The ruddiness upon her lip is wet;\n"+
		"You'll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own\n"+
		"With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"No, not these twenty years.\n"+
		"PERDITA\n"+
		"So long could I\n"+
		"Stand by, a looker on.\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"Either forbear,\n"+
		"Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you\n"+
		"For more amazement. If you can behold it,\n"+
		"I'll make the statue move indeed, descend\n"+
		"And take you by the hand; but then you'll think--\n"+
		"Which I protest against--I am assisted\n"+
		"By wicked powers.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"What you can make her do,\n"+
		"I am content to look on: what to speak,\n"+
		"I am content to hear; for 'tis as easy\n"+
		"To make her speak as move.\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"It is required\n"+
		"You do awake your faith. Then all stand still;\n"+
		"On: those that think it is unlawful business\n"+
		"I am about, let them depart.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"Proceed:\n"+
		"No foot shall stir.\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"Music, awake her; strike!\n"+
		"Music\n"+
		"'Tis time; descend; be stone no more; approach;\n"+
		"Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come,\n"+
		"I'll fill your grave up: stir, nay, come away,\n"+
		"Bequeath to death your numbness, for from him\n"+
		"Dear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs:\n"+
		"HERMIONE comes down\n"+
		"Start not; her actions shall be holy as\n"+
		"You hear my spell is lawful: do not shun her\n"+
		"Until you see her die again; for then\n"+
		"You kill her double. Nay, present your hand:\n"+
		"When she was young you woo'd her; now in age\n"+
		"Is she become the suitor?\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"O, she's warm!\n"+
		"If this be magic, let it be an art\n"+
		"Lawful as eating.\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"She embraces him.\n"+
		"CAMILLO\n"+
		"She hangs about his neck:\n"+
		"If she pertain to life let her speak too.\n"+
		"POLIXENES\n"+
		"Ay, and make't manifest where she has lived,\n"+
		"Or how stolen from the dead.\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"That she is living,\n"+
		"Were it but told you, should be hooted at\n"+
		"Like an old tale: but it appears she lives,\n"+
		"Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while.\n"+
		"Please you to interpose, fair madam: kneel\n"+
		"And pray your mother's blessing. Turn, good lady;\n"+
		"Our Perdita is found.\n"+
		"HERMIONE\n"+
		"You gods, look down\n"+
		"And from your sacred vials pour your graces\n"+
		"Upon my daughter's head! Tell me, mine own.\n"+
		"Where hast thou been preserved? where lived? how found\n"+
		"Thy father's court? for thou shalt hear that I,\n"+
		"Knowing by Paulina that the oracle\n"+
		"Gave hope thou wast in being, have preserved\n"+
		"Myself to see the issue.\n"+
		"PAULINA\n"+
		"There's time enough for that;\n"+
		"Lest they desire upon this push to trouble\n"+
		"Your joys with like relation. Go together,\n"+
		"You precious winners all; your exultation\n"+
		"Partake to every one. I, an old turtle,\n"+
		"Will wing me to some wither'd bough and there\n"+
		"My mate, that's never to be found again,\n"+
		"Lament till I am lost.\n"+
		"LEONTES\n"+
		"O, peace, Paulina!\n"+
		"Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,\n"+
		"As I by thine a wife: this is a match,\n"+
		"And made between's by vows. Thou hast found mine;\n"+
		"But how, is to be question'd; for I saw her,\n"+
		"As I thought, dead, and have in vain said many\n"+
		"A prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek far--\n"+
		"For him, I partly know his mind--to find thee\n"+
		"An honourable husband. Come, Camillo,\n"+
		"And take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty\n"+
		"Is richly noted and here justified\n"+
		"By us, a pair of kings. Let's from this place.\n"+
		"What! look upon my brother: both your pardons,\n"+
		"That e'er I put between your holy looks\n"+
		"My ill suspicion. This is your son-in-law,\n"+
		"And son unto the king, who, heavens directing,\n"+
		"Is troth-plight to your daughter. Good Paulina,\n"+
		"Lead us from hence, where we may leisurely\n"+
		"Each one demand an answer to his part\n"+
		"Perform'd in this wide gap of time since first\n"+
		"We were dissever'd: hastily lead away.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"
