		"The First part of King Henry the Fourth\n"+
		"ACT I\n"+
		"SCENE I. London. The palace.\n"+
		"Enter KING HENRY, LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER, the EARL of WESTMORELAND, SIR WALTER BLUNT, and others\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"So shaken as we are, so wan with care,\n"+
		"Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,\n"+
		"And breathe short-winded accents of new broils\n"+
		"To be commenced in strands afar remote.\n"+
		"No more the thirsty entrance of this soil\n"+
		"Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood;\n"+
		"Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,\n"+
		"Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs\n"+
		"Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes,\n"+
		"Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,\n"+
		"All of one nature, of one substance bred,\n"+
		"Did lately meet in the intestine shock\n"+
		"And furious close of civil butchery\n"+
		"Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,\n"+
		"March all one way and be no more opposed\n"+
		"Against acquaintance, kindred and allies:\n"+
		"The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,\n"+
		"No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,\n"+
		"As far as to the sepulchre of Christ,\n"+
		"Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross\n"+
		"We are impressed and engaged to fight,\n"+
		"Forthwith a power of English shall we levy;\n"+
		"Whose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb\n"+
		"To chase these pagans in those holy fields\n"+
		"Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet\n"+
		"Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd\n"+
		"For our advantage on the bitter cross.\n"+
		"But this our purpose now is twelve month old,\n"+
		"And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go:\n"+
		"Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear\n"+
		"Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,\n"+
		"What yesternight our council did decree\n"+
		"In forwarding this dear expedience.\n"+
		"WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"My liege, this haste was hot in question,\n"+
		"And many limits of the charge set down\n"+
		"But yesternight: when all athwart there came\n"+
		"A post from Wales loaden with heavy news;\n"+
		"Whose worst was, that the noble Mortimer,\n"+
		"Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight\n"+
		"Against the irregular and wild Glendower,\n"+
		"Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,\n"+
		"A thousand of his people butchered;\n"+
		"Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,\n"+
		"Such beastly shameless transformation,\n"+
		"By those Welshwomen done as may not be\n"+
		"Without much shame retold or spoken of.\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"It seems then that the tidings of this broil\n"+
		"Brake off our business for the Holy Land.\n"+
		"WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"This match'd with other did, my gracious lord;\n"+
		"For more uneven and unwelcome news\n"+
		"Came from the north and thus it did import:\n"+
		"On Holy-rood day, the gallant Hotspur there,\n"+
		"Young Harry Percy and brave Archibald,\n"+
		"That ever-valiant and approved Scot,\n"+
		"At Holmedon met,\n"+
		"Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour,\n"+
		"As by discharge of their artillery,\n"+
		"And shape of likelihood, the news was told;\n"+
		"For he that brought them, in the very heat\n"+
		"And pride of their contention did take horse,\n"+
		"Uncertain of the issue any way.\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"Here is a dear, a true industrious friend,\n"+
		"Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse.\n"+
		"Stain'd with the variation of each soil\n"+
		"Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours;\n"+
		"And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.\n"+
		"The Earl of Douglas is discomfited:\n"+
		"Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights,\n"+
		"Balk'd in their own blood did Sir Walter see\n"+
		"On Holmedon's plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took\n"+
		"Mordake the Earl of Fife, and eldest son\n"+
		"To beaten Douglas; and the Earl of Athol,\n"+
		"Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith:\n"+
		"And is not this an honourable spoil?\n"+
		"A gallant prize? ha, cousin, is it not?\n"+
		"WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"In faith,\n"+
		"It is a conquest for a prince to boast of.\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"Yea, there thou makest me sad and makest me sin\n"+
		"In envy that my Lord Northumberland\n"+
		"Should be the father to so blest a son,\n"+
		"A son who is the theme of honour's tongue;\n"+
		"Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant;\n"+
		"Who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride:\n"+
		"Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,\n"+
		"See riot and dishonour stain the brow\n"+
		"Of my young Harry. O that it could be proved\n"+
		"That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged\n"+
		"In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,\n"+
		"And call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet!\n"+
		"Then would I have his Harry, and he mine.\n"+
		"But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,\n"+
		"Of this young Percy's pride? the prisoners,\n"+
		"Which he in this adventure hath surprised,\n"+
		"To his own use he keeps; and sends me word,\n"+
		"I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.\n"+
		"WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"This is his uncle's teaching; this is Worcester,\n"+
		"Malevolent to you in all aspects;\n"+
		"Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up\n"+
		"The crest of youth against your dignity.\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"But I have sent for him to answer this;\n"+
		"And for this cause awhile we must neglect\n"+
		"Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.\n"+
		"Cousin, on Wednesday next our council we\n"+
		"Will hold at Windsor; so inform the lords:\n"+
		"But come yourself with speed to us again;\n"+
		"For more is to be said and to be done\n"+
		"Than out of anger can be uttered.\n"+
		"WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"I will, my liege.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. London. An apartment of the Prince's.\n"+
		"Enter the PRINCE OF WALES and FALSTAFF\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack\n"+
		"and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon\n"+
		"benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to\n"+
		"demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know.\n"+
		"What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the\n"+
		"day? Unless hours were cups of sack and minutes\n"+
		"capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the\n"+
		"signs of leaping-houses and the blessed sun himself\n"+
		"a fair hot wench in flame-coloured taffeta, I see no\n"+
		"reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand\n"+
		"the time of the day.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Indeed, you come near me now, Hal; for we that take\n"+
		"purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not\n"+
		"by Phoebus, he,'that wandering knight so fair.' And,\n"+
		"I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king, as, God\n"+
		"save thy grace,--majesty I should say, for grace\n"+
		"thou wilt have none,--\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"What, none?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to\n"+
		"prologue to an egg and butter.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Well, how then? come, roundly, roundly.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not\n"+
		"us that are squires of the night's body be called\n"+
		"thieves of the day's beauty: let us be Diana's\n"+
		"foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the\n"+
		"moon; and let men say we be men of good government,\n"+
		"being governed, as the sea is, by our noble and\n"+
		"chaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Thou sayest well, and it holds well too; for the\n"+
		"fortune of us that are the moon's men doth ebb and\n"+
		"flow like the sea, being governed, as the sea is,\n"+
		"by the moon. As, for proof, now: a purse of gold\n"+
		"most resolutely snatched on Monday night and most\n"+
		"dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning; got with\n"+
		"swearing 'Lay by' and spent with crying 'Bring in;'\n"+
		"now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder\n"+
		"and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"By the Lord, thou sayest true, lad. And is not my\n"+
		"hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle. And\n"+
		"is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"How now, how now, mad wag! what, in thy quips and\n"+
		"thy quiddities? what a plague have I to do with a\n"+
		"buff jerkin?\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Well, thou hast called her to a reckoning many a\n"+
		"time and oft.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"No; I'll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch;\n"+
		"and where it would not, I have used my credit.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Yea, and so used it that were it not here apparent\n"+
		"that thou art heir apparent--But, I prithee, sweet\n"+
		"wag, shall there be gallows standing in England when\n"+
		"thou art king? and resolution thus fobbed as it is\n"+
		"with the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Do\n"+
		"not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"No; thou shalt.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I'll be a brave judge.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Thou judgest false already: I mean, thou shalt have\n"+
		"the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Well, Hal, well; and in some sort it jumps with my\n"+
		"humour as well as waiting in the court, I can tell\n"+
		"you.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"For obtaining of suits?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman\n"+
		"hath no lean wardrobe. 'Sblood, I am as melancholy\n"+
		"as a gib cat or a lugged bear.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Or an old lion, or a lover's lute.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy of\n"+
		"Moor-ditch?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed\n"+
		"the most comparative, rascalliest, sweet young\n"+
		"prince. But, Hal, I prithee, trouble me no more\n"+
		"with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where a\n"+
		"commodity of good names were to be bought. An old\n"+
		"lord of the council rated me the other day in the\n"+
		"street about you, sir, but I marked him not; and yet\n"+
		"he talked very wisely, but I regarded him not; and\n"+
		"yet he talked wisely, and in the street too.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Thou didst well; for wisdom cries out in the\n"+
		"streets, and no man regards it.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"O, thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able\n"+
		"to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon\n"+
		"me, Hal; God forgive thee for it! Before I knew\n"+
		"thee, Hal, I knew nothing; and now am I, if a man\n"+
		"should speak truly, little better than one of the\n"+
		"wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give\n"+
		"it over: by the Lord, and I do not, I am a villain:\n"+
		"I'll be damned for never a king's son in\n"+
		"Christendom.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"'Zounds, where thou wilt, lad; I'll make one; an I\n"+
		"do not, call me villain and baffle me.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"I see a good amendment of life in thee; from praying\n"+
		"to purse-taking.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Why, Hal, 'tis my vocation, Hal; 'tis no sin for a\n"+
		"man to labour in his vocation.\n"+
		"Enter POINS\n"+
		"Poins! Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a\n"+
		"match. O, if men were to be saved by merit, what\n"+
		"hole in hell were hot enough for him? This is the\n"+
		"most omnipotent villain that ever cried 'Stand' to\n"+
		"a true man.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Good morrow, Ned.\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"Good morrow, sweet Hal. What says Monsieur Remorse?\n"+
		"what says Sir John Sack and Sugar? Jack! how\n"+
		"agrees the devil and thee about thy soul, that thou\n"+
		"soldest him on Good-Friday last for a cup of Madeira\n"+
		"and a cold capon's leg?\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Sir John stands to his word, the devil shall have\n"+
		"his bargain; for he was never yet a breaker of\n"+
		"proverbs: he will give the devil his due.\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"Then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Else he had been damned for cozening the devil.\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"But, my lads, my lads, to-morrow morning, by four\n"+
		"o'clock, early at Gadshill! there are pilgrims going\n"+
		"to Canterbury with rich offerings, and traders\n"+
		"riding to London with fat purses: I have vizards\n"+
		"for you all; you have horses for yourselves:\n"+
		"Gadshill lies to-night in Rochester: I have bespoke\n"+
		"supper to-morrow night in Eastcheap: we may do it\n"+
		"as secure as sleep. If you will go, I will stuff\n"+
		"your purses full of crowns; if you will not, tarry\n"+
		"at home and be hanged.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Hear ye, Yedward; if I tarry at home and go not,\n"+
		"I'll hang you for going.\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"You will, chops?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Hal, wilt thou make one?\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Who, I rob? I a thief? not I, by my faith.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"There's neither honesty, manhood, nor good\n"+
		"fellowship in thee, nor thou camest not of the blood\n"+
		"royal, if thou darest not stand for ten shillings.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Well then, once in my days I'll be a madcap.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Why, that's well said.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Well, come what will, I'll tarry at home.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"By the Lord, I'll be a traitor then, when thou art king.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"I care not.\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"Sir John, I prithee, leave the prince and me alone:\n"+
		"I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure\n"+
		"that he shall go.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion and him\n"+
		"the ears of profiting, that what thou speakest may\n"+
		"move and what he hears may be believed, that the\n"+
		"true prince may, for recreation sake, prove a false\n"+
		"thief; for the poor abuses of the time want\n"+
		"countenance. Farewell: you shall find me in Eastcheap.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Farewell, thou latter spring! farewell, All-hallown summer!\n"+
		"Exit Falstaff\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us\n"+
		"to-morrow: I have a jest to execute that I cannot\n"+
		"manage alone. Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto and Gadshill\n"+
		"shall rob those men that we have already waylaid:\n"+
		"yourself and I will not be there; and when they\n"+
		"have the booty, if you and I do not rob them, cut\n"+
		"this head off from my shoulders.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"How shall we part with them in setting forth?\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"Why, we will set forth before or after them, and\n"+
		"appoint them a place of meeting, wherein it is at\n"+
		"our pleasure to fail, and then will they adventure\n"+
		"upon the exploit themselves; which they shall have\n"+
		"no sooner achieved, but we'll set upon them.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Yea, but 'tis like that they will know us by our\n"+
		"horses, by our habits and by every other\n"+
		"appointment, to be ourselves.\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"Tut! our horses they shall not see: I'll tie them\n"+
		"in the wood; our vizards we will change after we\n"+
		"leave them: and, sirrah, I have cases of buckram\n"+
		"for the nonce, to immask our noted outward garments.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Yea, but I doubt they will be too hard for us.\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"Well, for two of them, I know them to be as\n"+
		"true-bred cowards as ever turned back; and for the\n"+
		"third, if he fight longer than he sees reason, I'll\n"+
		"forswear arms. The virtue of this jest will be, the\n"+
		"incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will\n"+
		"tell us when we meet at supper: how thirty, at\n"+
		"least, he fought with; what wards, what blows, what\n"+
		"extremities he endured; and in the reproof of this\n"+
		"lies the jest.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Well, I'll go with thee: provide us all things\n"+
		"necessary and meet me to-morrow night in Eastcheap;\n"+
		"there I'll sup. Farewell.\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"Farewell, my lord.\n"+
		"Exit Poins\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"I know you all, and will awhile uphold\n"+
		"The unyoked humour of your idleness:\n"+
		"Yet herein will I imitate the sun,\n"+
		"Who doth permit the base contagious clouds\n"+
		"To smother up his beauty from the world,\n"+
		"That, when he please again to be himself,\n"+
		"Being wanted, he may be more wonder'd at,\n"+
		"By breaking through the foul and ugly mists\n"+
		"Of vapours that did seem to strangle him.\n"+
		"If all the year were playing holidays,\n"+
		"To sport would be as tedious as to work;\n"+
		"But when they seldom come, they wish'd for come,\n"+
		"And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.\n"+
		"So, when this loose behavior I throw off\n"+
		"And pay the debt I never promised,\n"+
		"By how much better than my word I am,\n"+
		"By so much shall I falsify men's hopes;\n"+
		"And like bright metal on a sullen ground,\n"+
		"My reformation, glittering o'er my fault,\n"+
		"Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes\n"+
		"Than that which hath no foil to set it off.\n"+
		"I'll so offend, to make offence a skill;\n"+
		"Redeeming time when men think least I will.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE III. London. The palace.\n"+
		"Enter the KING, NORTHUMBERLAND, WORCESTER, HOTSPUR, SIR WALTER BLUNT, with others\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"My blood hath been too cold and temperate,\n"+
		"Unapt to stir at these indignities,\n"+
		"And you have found me; for accordingly\n"+
		"You tread upon my patience: but be sure\n"+
		"I will from henceforth rather be myself,\n"+
		"Mighty and to be fear'd, than my condition;\n"+
		"Which hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down,\n"+
		"And therefore lost that title of respect\n"+
		"Which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud.\n"+
		"EARL OF WORCESTER\n"+
		"Our house, my sovereign liege, little deserves\n"+
		"The scourge of greatness to be used on it;\n"+
		"And that same greatness too which our own hands\n"+
		"Have holp to make so portly.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"My lord.--\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"Worcester, get thee gone; for I do see\n"+
		"Danger and disobedience in thine eye:\n"+
		"O, sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory,\n"+
		"And majesty might never yet endure\n"+
		"The moody frontier of a servant brow.\n"+
		"You have good leave to leave us: when we need\n"+
		"Your use and counsel, we shall send for you.\n"+
		"Exit Worcester\n"+
		"You were about to speak.\n"+
		"To North\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"Yea, my good lord.\n"+
		"Those prisoners in your highness' name demanded,\n"+
		"Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,\n"+
		"Were, as he says, not with such strength denied\n"+
		"As is deliver'd to your majesty:\n"+
		"Either envy, therefore, or misprison\n"+
		"Is guilty of this fault and not my son.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"My liege, I did deny no prisoners.\n"+
		"But I remember, when the fight was done,\n"+
		"When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,\n"+
		"Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,\n"+
		"Came there a certain lord, neat, and trimly dress'd,\n"+
		"Fresh as a bridegroom; and his chin new reap'd\n"+
		"Show'd like a stubble-land at harvest-home;\n"+
		"He was perfumed like a milliner;\n"+
		"And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held\n"+
		"A pouncet-box, which ever and anon\n"+
		"He gave his nose and took't away again;\n"+
		"Who therewith angry, when it next came there,\n"+
		"Took it in snuff; and still he smiled and talk'd,\n"+
		"And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,\n"+
		"He call'd them untaught knaves, unmannerly,\n"+
		"To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse\n"+
		"Betwixt the wind and his nobility.\n"+
		"With many holiday and lady terms\n"+
		"He question'd me; amongst the rest, demanded\n"+
		"My prisoners in your majesty's behalf.\n"+
		"I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,\n"+
		"To be so pester'd with a popinjay,\n"+
		"Out of my grief and my impatience,\n"+
		"Answer'd neglectingly I know not what,\n"+
		"He should or he should not; for he made me mad\n"+
		"To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet\n"+
		"And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman\n"+
		"Of guns and drums and wounds,--God save the mark!--\n"+
		"And telling me the sovereign'st thing on earth\n"+
		"Was parmaceti for an inward bruise;\n"+
		"And that it was great pity, so it was,\n"+
		"This villanous salt-petre should be digg'd\n"+
		"Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,\n"+
		"Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd\n"+
		"So cowardly; and but for these vile guns,\n"+
		"He would himself have been a soldier.\n"+
		"This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,\n"+
		"I answer'd indirectly, as I said;\n"+
		"And I beseech you, let not his report\n"+
		"Come current for an accusation\n"+
		"Betwixt my love and your high majesty.\n"+
		"SIR WALTER BLUNT\n"+
		"The circumstance consider'd, good my lord,\n"+
		"Whate'er Lord Harry Percy then had said\n"+
		"To such a person and in such a place,\n"+
		"At such a time, with all the rest retold,\n"+
		"May reasonably die and never rise\n"+
		"To do him wrong or any way impeach\n"+
		"What then he said, so he unsay it now.\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners,\n"+
		"But with proviso and exception,\n"+
		"That we at our own charge shall ransom straight\n"+
		"His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer;\n"+
		"Who, on my soul, hath wilfully betray'd\n"+
		"The lives of those that he did lead to fight\n"+
		"Against that great magician, damn'd Glendower,\n"+
		"Whose daughter, as we hear, the Earl of March\n"+
		"Hath lately married. Shall our coffers, then,\n"+
		"Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?\n"+
		"Shall we but treason? and indent with fears,\n"+
		"When they have lost and forfeited themselves?\n"+
		"No, on the barren mountains let him starve;\n"+
		"For I shall never hold that man my friend\n"+
		"Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost\n"+
		"To ransom home revolted Mortimer.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"Revolted Mortimer!\n"+
		"He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,\n"+
		"But by the chance of war; to prove that true\n"+
		"Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,\n"+
		"Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took\n"+
		"When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank,\n"+
		"In single opposition, hand to hand,\n"+
		"He did confound the best part of an hour\n"+
		"In changing hardiment with great Glendower:\n"+
		"Three times they breathed and three times did\n"+
		"they drink,\n"+
		"Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood;\n"+
		"Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,\n"+
		"Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds,\n"+
		"And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,\n"+
		"Bloodstained with these valiant combatants.\n"+
		"Never did base and rotten policy\n"+
		"Colour her working with such deadly wounds;\n"+
		"Nor could the noble Mortimer\n"+
		"Receive so many, and all willingly:\n"+
		"Then let not him be slander'd with revolt.\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"Thou dost belie him, Percy, thou dost belie him;\n"+
		"He never did encounter with Glendower:\n"+
		"I tell thee,\n"+
		"He durst as well have met the devil alone\n"+
		"As Owen Glendower for an enemy.\n"+
		"Art thou not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth\n"+
		"Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer:\n"+
		"Send me your prisoners with the speediest means,\n"+
		"Or you shall hear in such a kind from me\n"+
		"As will displease you. My Lord Northumberland,\n"+
		"We licence your departure with your son.\n"+
		"Send us your prisoners, or you will hear of it.\n"+
		"Exeunt King Henry, Blunt, and train\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"An if the devil come and roar for them,\n"+
		"I will not send them: I will after straight\n"+
		"And tell him so; for I will ease my heart,\n"+
		"Albeit I make a hazard of my head.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"What, drunk with choler? stay and pause awhile:\n"+
		"Here comes your uncle.\n"+
		"Re-enter WORCESTER\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"Speak of Mortimer!\n"+
		"'Zounds, I will speak of him; and let my soul\n"+
		"Want mercy, if I do not join with him:\n"+
		"Yea, on his part I'll empty all these veins,\n"+
		"And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust,\n"+
		"But I will lift the down-trod Mortimer\n"+
		"As high in the air as this unthankful king,\n"+
		"As this ingrate and canker'd Bolingbroke.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"Brother, the king hath made your nephew mad.\n"+
		"EARL OF WORCESTER\n"+
		"Who struck this heat up after I was gone?\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"He will, forsooth, have all my prisoners;\n"+
		"And when I urged the ransom once again\n"+
		"Of my wife's brother, then his cheek look'd pale,\n"+
		"And on my face he turn'd an eye of death,\n"+
		"Trembling even at the name of Mortimer.\n"+
		"EARL OF WORCESTER\n"+
		"I cannot blame him: was not he proclaim'd\n"+
		"By Richard that dead is the next of blood?\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"He was; I heard the proclamation:\n"+
		"And then it was when the unhappy king,\n"+
		"--Whose wrongs in us God pardon!--did set forth\n"+
		"Upon his Irish expedition;\n"+
		"From whence he intercepted did return\n"+
		"To be deposed and shortly murdered.\n"+
		"EARL OF WORCESTER\n"+
		"And for whose death we in the world's wide mouth\n"+
		"Live scandalized and foully spoken of.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"But soft, I pray you; did King Richard then\n"+
		"Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer\n"+
		"Heir to the crown?\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"He did; myself did hear it.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"Nay, then I cannot blame his cousin king,\n"+
		"That wished him on the barren mountains starve.\n"+
		"But shall it be that you, that set the crown\n"+
		"Upon the head of this forgetful man\n"+
		"And for his sake wear the detested blot\n"+
		"Of murderous subornation, shall it be,\n"+
		"That you a world of curses undergo,\n"+
		"Being the agents, or base second means,\n"+
		"The cords, the ladder, or the hangman rather?\n"+
		"O, pardon me that I descend so low,\n"+
		"To show the line and the predicament\n"+
		"Wherein you range under this subtle king;\n"+
		"Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,\n"+
		"Or fill up chronicles in time to come,\n"+
		"That men of your nobility and power\n"+
		"Did gage them both in an unjust behalf,\n"+
		"As both of you--God pardon it!--have done,\n"+
		"To put down Richard, that sweet lovely rose,\n"+
		"An plant this thorn, this canker, Bolingbroke?\n"+
		"And shall it in more shame be further spoken,\n"+
		"That you are fool'd, discarded and shook off\n"+
		"By him for whom these shames ye underwent?\n"+
		"No; yet time serves wherein you may redeem\n"+
		"Your banish'd honours and restore yourselves\n"+
		"Into the good thoughts of the world again,\n"+
		"Revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt\n"+
		"Of this proud king, who studies day and night\n"+
		"To answer all the debt he owes to you\n"+
		"Even with the bloody payment of your deaths:\n"+
		"Therefore, I say--\n"+
		"EARL OF WORCESTER\n"+
		"Peace, cousin, say no more:\n"+
		"And now I will unclasp a secret book,\n"+
		"And to your quick-conceiving discontents\n"+
		"I'll read you matter deep and dangerous,\n"+
		"As full of peril and adventurous spirit\n"+
		"As to o'er-walk a current roaring loud\n"+
		"On the unsteadfast footing of a spear.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"If he fall in, good night! or sink or swim:\n"+
		"Send danger from the east unto the west,\n"+
		"So honour cross it from the north to south,\n"+
		"And let them grapple: O, the blood more stirs\n"+
		"To rouse a lion than to start a hare!\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"Imagination of some great exploit\n"+
		"Drives him beyond the bounds of patience.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"By heaven, methinks it were an easy leap,\n"+
		"To pluck bright honour from the pale-faced moon,\n"+
		"Or dive into the bottom of the deep,\n"+
		"Where fathom-line could never touch the ground,\n"+
		"And pluck up drowned honour by the locks;\n"+
		"So he that doth redeem her thence might wear\n"+
		"Without corrival, all her dignities:\n"+
		"But out upon this half-faced fellowship!\n"+
		"EARL OF WORCESTER\n"+
		"He apprehends a world of figures here,\n"+
		"But not the form of what he should attend.\n"+
		"Good cousin, give me audience for a while.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"I cry you mercy.\n"+
		"EARL OF WORCESTER\n"+
		"Those same noble Scots\n"+
		"That are your prisoners,--\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"I'll keep them all;\n"+
		"By God, he shall not have a Scot of them;\n"+
		"No, if a Scot would save his soul, he shall not:\n"+
		"I'll keep them, by this hand.\n"+
		"EARL OF WORCESTER\n"+
		"You start away\n"+
		"And lend no ear unto my purposes.\n"+
		"Those prisoners you shall keep.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"Nay, I will; that's flat:\n"+
		"He said he would not ransom Mortimer;\n"+
		"Forbad my tongue to speak of Mortimer;\n"+
		"But I will find him when he lies asleep,\n"+
		"And in his ear I'll holla 'Mortimer!'\n"+
		"Nay,\n"+
		"I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak\n"+
		"Nothing but 'Mortimer,' and give it him\n"+
		"To keep his anger still in motion.\n"+
		"EARL OF WORCESTER\n"+
		"Hear you, cousin; a word.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"All studies here I solemnly defy,\n"+
		"Save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke:\n"+
		"And that same sword-and-buckler Prince of Wales,\n"+
		"But that I think his father loves him not\n"+
		"And would be glad he met with some mischance,\n"+
		"I would have him poison'd with a pot of ale.\n"+
		"EARL OF WORCESTER\n"+
		"Farewell, kinsman: I'll talk to you\n"+
		"When you are better temper'd to attend.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"Why, what a wasp-stung and impatient fool\n"+
		"Art thou to break into this woman's mood,\n"+
		"Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own!\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"Why, look you, I am whipp'd and scourged with rods,\n"+
		"Nettled and stung with pismires, when I hear\n"+
		"Of this vile politician, Bolingbroke.\n"+
		"In Richard's time,--what do you call the place?--\n"+
		"A plague upon it, it is in Gloucestershire;\n"+
		"'Twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept,\n"+
		"His uncle York; where I first bow'd my knee\n"+
		"Unto this king of smiles, this Bolingbroke,--\n"+
		"'Sblood!--\n"+
		"When you and he came back from Ravenspurgh.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"At Berkley castle.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"You say true:\n"+
		"Why, what a candy deal of courtesy\n"+
		"This fawning greyhound then did proffer me!\n"+
		"Look,'when his infant fortune came to age,'\n"+
		"And 'gentle Harry Percy,' and 'kind cousin;'\n"+
		"O, the devil take such cozeners! God forgive me!\n"+
		"Good uncle, tell your tale; I have done.\n"+
		"EARL OF WORCESTER\n"+
		"Nay, if you have not, to it again;\n"+
		"We will stay your leisure.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"I have done, i' faith.\n"+
		"EARL OF WORCESTER\n"+
		"Then once more to your Scottish prisoners.\n"+
		"Deliver them up without their ransom straight,\n"+
		"And make the Douglas' son your only mean\n"+
		"For powers in Scotland; which, for divers reasons\n"+
		"Which I shall send you written, be assured,\n"+
		"Will easily be granted. You, my lord,\n"+
		"To Northumberland\n"+
		"Your son in Scotland being thus employ'd,\n"+
		"Shall secretly into the bosom creep\n"+
		"Of that same noble prelate, well beloved,\n"+
		"The archbishop.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"Of York, is it not?\n"+
		"EARL OF WORCESTER\n"+
		"True; who bears hard\n"+
		"His brother's death at Bristol, the Lord Scroop.\n"+
		"I speak not this in estimation,\n"+
		"As what I think might be, but what I know\n"+
		"Is ruminated, plotted and set down,\n"+
		"And only stays but to behold the face\n"+
		"Of that occasion that shall bring it on.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"I smell it: upon my life, it will do well.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"Before the game is afoot, thou still let'st slip.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"Why, it cannot choose but be a noble plot;\n"+
		"And then the power of Scotland and of York,\n"+
		"To join with Mortimer, ha?\n"+
		"EARL OF WORCESTER\n"+
		"And so they shall.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"In faith, it is exceedingly well aim'd.\n"+
		"EARL OF WORCESTER\n"+
		"And 'tis no little reason bids us speed,\n"+
		"To save our heads by raising of a head;\n"+
		"For, bear ourselves as even as we can,\n"+
		"The king will always think him in our debt,\n"+
		"And think we think ourselves unsatisfied,\n"+
		"Till he hath found a time to pay us home:\n"+
		"And see already how he doth begin\n"+
		"To make us strangers to his looks of love.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"He does, he does: we'll be revenged on him.\n"+
		"EARL OF WORCESTER\n"+
		"Cousin, farewell: no further go in this\n"+
		"Than I by letters shall direct your course.\n"+
		"When time is ripe, which will be suddenly,\n"+
		"I'll steal to Glendower and Lord Mortimer;\n"+
		"Where you and Douglas and our powers at once,\n"+
		"As I will fashion it, shall happily meet,\n"+
		"To bear our fortunes in our own strong arms,\n"+
		"Which now we hold at much uncertainty.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"Farewell, good brother: we shall thrive, I trust.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"Uncle, Adieu: O, let the hours be short\n"+
		"Till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport!\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT II\n"+
		"SCENE I. Rochester. An inn yard.\n"+
		"Enter a Carrier with a lantern in his hand\n"+
		"First Carrier\n"+
		"Heigh-ho! an it be not four by the day, I'll be\n"+
		"hanged: Charles' wain is over the new chimney, and\n"+
		"yet our horse not packed. What, ostler!\n"+
		"Ostler\n"+
		"[Within] Anon, anon.\n"+
		"First Carrier\n"+
		"I prithee, Tom, beat Cut's saddle, put a few flocks\n"+
		"in the point; poor jade, is wrung in the withers out\n"+
		"of all cess.\n"+
		"Enter another Carrier\n"+
		"Second Carrier\n"+
		"Peas and beans are as dank here as a dog, and that\n"+
		"is the next way to give poor jades the bots: this\n"+
		"house is turned upside down since Robin Ostler died.\n"+
		"First Carrier\n"+
		"Poor fellow, never joyed since the price of oats\n"+
		"rose; it was the death of him.\n"+
		"Second Carrier\n"+
		"I think this be the most villanous house in all\n"+
		"London road for fleas: I am stung like a tench.\n"+
		"First Carrier\n"+
		"Like a tench! by the mass, there is ne'er a king\n"+
		"christen could be better bit than I have been since\n"+
		"the first cock.\n"+
		"Second Carrier\n"+
		"Why, they will allow us ne'er a jordan, and then we\n"+
		"leak in your chimney; and your chamber-lie breeds\n"+
		"fleas like a loach.\n"+
		"First Carrier\n"+
		"What, ostler! come away and be hanged!\n"+
		"Second Carrier\n"+
		"I have a gammon of bacon and two razors of ginger,\n"+
		"to be delivered as far as Charing-cross.\n"+
		"First Carrier\n"+
		"God's body! the turkeys in my pannier are quite\n"+
		"starved. What, ostler! A plague on thee! hast thou\n"+
		"never an eye in thy head? canst not hear? An\n"+
		"'twere not as good deed as drink, to break the pate\n"+
		"on thee, I am a very villain. Come, and be hanged!\n"+
		"hast thou no faith in thee?\n"+
		"Enter GADSHILL\n"+
		"GADSHILL\n"+
		"Good morrow, carriers. What's o'clock?\n"+
		"First Carrier\n"+
		"I think it be two o'clock.\n"+
		"GADSHILL\n"+
		"I pray thee lend me thy lantern, to see my gelding\n"+
		"in the stable.\n"+
		"First Carrier\n"+
		"Nay, by God, soft; I know a trick worth two of that, i' faith.\n"+
		"GADSHILL\n"+
		"I pray thee, lend me thine.\n"+
		"Second Carrier\n"+
		"Ay, when? can'st tell? Lend me thy lantern, quoth\n"+
		"he? marry, I'll see thee hanged first.\n"+
		"GADSHILL\n"+
		"Sirrah carrier, what time do you mean to come to London?\n"+
		"Second Carrier\n"+
		"Time enough to go to bed with a candle, I warrant\n"+
		"thee. Come, neighbour Mugs, we'll call up the\n"+
		"gentleman: they will along with company, for they\n"+
		"have great charge.\n"+
		"Exeunt carriers\n"+
		"GADSHILL\n"+
		"What, ho! chamberlain!\n"+
		"Chamberlain\n"+
		"[Within] At hand, quoth pick-purse.\n"+
		"GADSHILL\n"+
		"That's even as fair as--at hand, quoth the\n"+
		"chamberlain; for thou variest no more from picking\n"+
		"of purses than giving direction doth from labouring;\n"+
		"thou layest the plot how.\n"+
		"Enter Chamberlain\n"+
		"Chamberlain\n"+
		"Good morrow, Master Gadshill. It holds current that\n"+
		"I told you yesternight: there's a franklin in the\n"+
		"wild of Kent hath brought three hundred marks with\n"+
		"him in gold: I heard him tell it to one of his\n"+
		"company last night at supper; a kind of auditor; one\n"+
		"that hath abundance of charge too, God knows what.\n"+
		"They are up already, and call for eggs and butter;\n"+
		"they will away presently.\n"+
		"GADSHILL\n"+
		"Sirrah, if they meet not with Saint Nicholas'\n"+
		"clerks, I'll give thee this neck.\n"+
		"Chamberlain\n"+
		"No, I'll none of it: I pray thee keep that for the\n"+
		"hangman; for I know thou worshippest St. Nicholas\n"+
		"as truly as a man of falsehood may.\n"+
		"GADSHILL\n"+
		"What talkest thou to me of the hangman? if I hang,\n"+
		"I'll make a fat pair of gallows; for if I hang, old\n"+
		"Sir John hangs with me, and thou knowest he is no\n"+
		"starveling. Tut! there are other Trojans that thou\n"+
		"dreamest not of, the which for sport sake are\n"+
		"content to do the profession some grace; that would,\n"+
		"if matters should be looked into, for their own\n"+
		"credit sake, make all whole. I am joined with no\n"+
		"foot-land rakers, no long-staff sixpenny strikers,\n"+
		"none of these mad mustachio purple-hued malt-worms;\n"+
		"but with nobility and tranquillity, burgomasters and\n"+
		"great oneyers, such as can hold in, such as will\n"+
		"strike sooner than speak, and speak sooner than\n"+
		"drink, and drink sooner than pray: and yet, zounds,\n"+
		"I lie; for they pray continually to their saint, the\n"+
		"commonwealth; or rather, not pray to her, but prey\n"+
		"on her, for they ride up and down on her and make\n"+
		"her their boots.\n"+
		"Chamberlain\n"+
		"What, the commonwealth their boots? will she hold\n"+
		"out water in foul way?\n"+
		"GADSHILL\n"+
		"She will, she will; justice hath liquored her. We\n"+
		"steal as in a castle, cocksure; we have the receipt\n"+
		"of fern-seed, we walk invisible.\n"+
		"Chamberlain\n"+
		"Nay, by my faith, I think you are more beholding to\n"+
		"the night than to fern-seed for your walking invisible.\n"+
		"GADSHILL\n"+
		"Give me thy hand: thou shalt have a share in our\n"+
		"purchase, as I am a true man.\n"+
		"Chamberlain\n"+
		"Nay, rather let me have it, as you are a false thief.\n"+
		"GADSHILL\n"+
		"Go to; 'homo' is a common name to all men. Bid the\n"+
		"ostler bring my gelding out of the stable. Farewell,\n"+
		"you muddy knave.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. The highway, near Gadshill.\n"+
		"Enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"Come, shelter, shelter: I have removed Falstaff's\n"+
		"horse, and he frets like a gummed velvet.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Stand close.\n"+
		"Enter FALSTAFF\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Poins! Poins, and be hanged! Poins!\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Peace, ye fat-kidneyed rascal! what a brawling dost\n"+
		"thou keep!\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Where's Poins, Hal?\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"He is walked up to the top of the hill: I'll go seek him.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"I am accursed to rob in that thief's company: the\n"+
		"rascal hath removed my horse, and tied him I know\n"+
		"not where. If I travel but four foot by the squier\n"+
		"further afoot, I shall break my wind. Well, I doubt\n"+
		"not but to die a fair death for all this, if I\n"+
		"'scape hanging for killing that rogue. I have\n"+
		"forsworn his company hourly any time this two and\n"+
		"twenty years, and yet I am bewitched with the\n"+
		"rogue's company. If the rascal hath not given me\n"+
		"medicines to make me love him, I'll be hanged; it\n"+
		"could not be else: I have drunk medicines. Poins!\n"+
		"Hal! a plague upon you both! Bardolph! Peto!\n"+
		"I'll starve ere I'll rob a foot further. An 'twere\n"+
		"not as good a deed as drink, to turn true man and to\n"+
		"leave these rogues, I am the veriest varlet that\n"+
		"ever chewed with a tooth. Eight yards of uneven\n"+
		"ground is threescore and ten miles afoot with me;\n"+
		"and the stony-hearted villains know it well enough:\n"+
		"a plague upon it when thieves cannot be true one to another!\n"+
		"They whistle\n"+
		"Whew! A plague upon you all! Give me my horse, you\n"+
		"rogues; give me my horse, and be hanged!\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Peace, ye fat-guts! lie down; lay thine ear close\n"+
		"to the ground and list if thou canst hear the tread\n"+
		"of travellers.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Have you any levers to lift me up again, being down?\n"+
		"'Sblood, I'll not bear mine own flesh so far afoot\n"+
		"again for all the coin in thy father's exchequer.\n"+
		"What a plague mean ye to colt me thus?\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Thou liest; thou art not colted, thou art uncolted.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"I prithee, good Prince Hal, help me to my horse,\n"+
		"good king's son.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Out, ye rogue! shall I be your ostler?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Go, hang thyself in thine own heir-apparent\n"+
		"garters! If I be ta'en, I'll peach for this. An I\n"+
		"have not ballads made on you all and sung to filthy\n"+
		"tunes, let a cup of sack be my poison: when a jest\n"+
		"is so forward, and afoot too! I hate it.\n"+
		"Enter GADSHILL, BARDOLPH and PETO\n"+
		"GADSHILL\n"+
		"Stand.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"So I do, against my will.\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"O, 'tis our setter: I know his voice. Bardolph,\n"+
		"what news?\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Case ye, case ye; on with your vizards: there 's\n"+
		"money of the king's coming down the hill; 'tis going\n"+
		"to the king's exchequer.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"You lie, ye rogue; 'tis going to the king's tavern.\n"+
		"GADSHILL\n"+
		"There's enough to make us all.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"To be hanged.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Sirs, you four shall front them in the narrow lane;\n"+
		"Ned Poins and I will walk lower: if they 'scape\n"+
		"from your encounter, then they light on us.\n"+
		"PETO\n"+
		"How many be there of them?\n"+
		"GADSHILL\n"+
		"Some eight or ten.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"'Zounds, will they not rob us?\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"What, a coward, Sir John Paunch?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Indeed, I am not John of Gaunt, your grandfather;\n"+
		"but yet no coward, Hal.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Well, we leave that to the proof.\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"Sirrah Jack, thy horse stands behind the hedge:\n"+
		"when thou needest him, there thou shalt find him.\n"+
		"Farewell, and stand fast.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Now cannot I strike him, if I should be hanged.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Ned, where are our disguises?\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"Here, hard by: stand close.\n"+
		"Exeunt PRINCE HENRY and POINS\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Now, my masters, happy man be his dole, say I:\n"+
		"every man to his business.\n"+
		"Enter the Travellers\n"+
		"First Traveller\n"+
		"Come, neighbour: the boy shall lead our horses down\n"+
		"the hill; we'll walk afoot awhile, and ease our legs.\n"+
		"Thieves\n"+
		"Stand!\n"+
		"Travellers\n"+
		"Jesus bless us!\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Strike; down with them; cut the villains' throats:\n"+
		"ah! whoreson caterpillars! bacon-fed knaves! they\n"+
		"hate us youth: down with them: fleece them.\n"+
		"Travellers\n"+
		"O, we are undone, both we and ours for ever!\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Hang ye, gorbellied knaves, are ye undone? No, ye\n"+
		"fat chuffs: I would your store were here! On,\n"+
		"bacons, on! What, ye knaves! young men must live.\n"+
		"You are Grand-jurors, are ye? we'll jure ye, 'faith.\n"+
		"Here they rob them and bind them. Exeunt\n"+
		"Re-enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"The thieves have bound the true men. Now could thou\n"+
		"and I rob the thieves and go merrily to London, it\n"+
		"would be argument for a week, laughter for a month\n"+
		"and a good jest for ever.\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"Stand close; I hear them coming.\n"+
		"Enter the Thieves again\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Come, my masters, let us share, and then to horse\n"+
		"before day. An the Prince and Poins be not two\n"+
		"arrant cowards, there's no equity stirring: there's\n"+
		"no more valour in that Poins than in a wild-duck.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Your money!\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"Villains!\n"+
		"As they are sharing, the Prince and Poins set upon them; they all run away; and Falstaff, after a blow or two, runs away too, leaving the booty behind them\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Got with much ease. Now merrily to horse:\n"+
		"The thieves are all scatter'd and possess'd with fear\n"+
		"So strongly that they dare not meet each other;\n"+
		"Each takes his fellow for an officer.\n"+
		"Away, good Ned. Falstaff sweats to death,\n"+

		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. Warkworth castle\n"+
		"Enter HOTSPUR, solus, reading a letter\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"'But for mine own part, my lord, I could be well\n"+
		"contented to be there, in respect of the love I bear\n"+
		"your house.' He could be contented: why is he not,\n"+
		"then? In respect of the love he bears our house:\n"+
		"he shows in this, he loves his own barn better than\n"+
		"he loves our house. Let me see some more. 'The\n"+
		"purpose you undertake is dangerous;'--why, that's\n"+
		"certain: 'tis dangerous to take a cold, to sleep, to\n"+
		"drink; but I tell you, my lord fool, out of this\n"+
		"nettle, danger, we pluck this flower, safety. 'The\n"+
		"purpose you undertake is dangerous; the friends you\n"+
		"have named uncertain; the time itself unsorted; and\n"+
		"your whole plot too light for the counterpoise of so\n"+
		"great an opposition.' Say you so, say you so? I say\n"+
		"unto you again, you are a shallow cowardly hind, and\n"+
		"you lie. What a lack-brain is this! By the Lord,\n"+
		"our plot is a good plot as ever was laid; our\n"+
		"friends true and constant: a good plot, good\n"+
		"friends, and full of expectation; an excellent plot,\n"+
		"very good friends. What a frosty-spirited rogue is\n"+
		"this! Why, my lord of York commends the plot and the\n"+
		"general course of action. 'Zounds, an I were now by\n"+
		"this rascal, I could brain him with his lady's fan.\n"+
		"Is there not my father, my uncle and myself? lord\n"+
		"Edmund Mortimer, My lord of York and Owen Glendower?\n"+
		"is there not besides the Douglas? have I not all\n"+
		"their letters to meet me in arms by the ninth of the\n"+
		"next month? and are they not some of them set\n"+
		"forward already? What a pagan rascal is this! an\n"+
		"infidel! Ha! you shall see now in very sincerity\n"+
		"of fear and cold heart, will he to the king and lay\n"+
		"open all our proceedings. O, I could divide myself\n"+
		"and go to buffets, for moving such a dish of\n"+
		"skim milk with so honourable an action! Hang him!\n"+
		"let him tell the king: we are prepared. I will set\n"+
		"forward to-night.\n"+
		"Enter LADY PERCY\n"+
		"How now, Kate! I must leave you within these two hours.\n"+
		"LADY PERCY\n"+
		"O, my good lord, why are you thus alone?\n"+
		"For what offence have I this fortnight been\n"+
		"A banish'd woman from my Harry's bed?\n"+
		"Tell me, sweet lord, what is't that takes from thee\n"+
		"Thy stomach, pleasure and thy golden sleep?\n"+
		"Why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth,\n"+
		"And start so often when thou sit'st alone?\n"+
		"Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks;\n"+
		"And given my treasures and my rights of thee\n"+
		"To thick-eyed musing and cursed melancholy?\n"+
		"In thy faint slumbers I by thee have watch'd,\n"+
		"And heard thee murmur tales of iron wars;\n"+
		"Speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed;\n"+
		"Cry 'Courage! to the field!' And thou hast talk'd\n"+
		"Of sallies and retires, of trenches, tents,\n"+
		"Of palisadoes, frontiers, parapets,\n"+
		"Of basilisks, of cannon, culverin,\n"+
		"Of prisoners' ransom and of soldiers slain,\n"+
		"And all the currents of a heady fight.\n"+
		"Thy spirit within thee hath been so at war\n"+
		"And thus hath so bestirr'd thee in thy sleep,\n"+
		"That beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow\n"+
		"Like bubbles in a late-disturbed stream;\n"+
		"And in thy face strange motions have appear'd,\n"+
		"Such as we see when men restrain their breath\n"+
		"On some great sudden hest. O, what portents are these?\n"+
		"Some heavy business hath my lord in hand,\n"+
		"And I must know it, else he loves me not.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"What, ho!\n"+
		"Enter Servant\n"+
		"Is Gilliams with the packet gone?\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"He is, my lord, an hour ago.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"Hath Butler brought those horses from the sheriff?\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"One horse, my lord, he brought even now.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"What horse? a roan, a crop-ear, is it not?\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"It is, my lord.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"That roan shall by my throne.\n"+
		"Well, I will back him straight: O esperance!\n"+
		"Bid Butler lead him forth into the park.\n"+
		"Exit Servant\n"+
		"LADY PERCY\n"+
		"But hear you, my lord.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"What say'st thou, my lady?\n"+
		"LADY PERCY\n"+
		"What is it carries you away?\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"Why, my horse, my love, my horse.\n"+
		"LADY PERCY\n"+
		"Out, you mad-headed ape!\n"+
		"A weasel hath not such a deal of spleen\n"+
		"As you are toss'd with. In faith,\n"+
		"I'll know your business, Harry, that I will.\n"+
		"I fear my brother Mortimer doth stir\n"+
		"About his title, and hath sent for you\n"+
		"To line his enterprise: but if you go,--\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"So far afoot, I shall be weary, love.\n"+
		"LADY PERCY\n"+
		"Come, come, you paraquito, answer me\n"+
		"Directly unto this question that I ask:\n"+
		"In faith, I'll break thy little finger, Harry,\n"+
		"An if thou wilt not tell me all things true.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"Away,\n"+
		"Away, you trifler! Love! I love thee not,\n"+
		"I care not for thee, Kate: this is no world\n"+
		"To play with mammets and to tilt with lips:\n"+
		"We must have bloody noses and crack'd crowns,\n"+
		"And pass them current too. God's me, my horse!\n"+
		"What say'st thou, Kate? what would'st thou\n"+
		"have with me?\n"+
		"LADY PERCY\n"+
		"Do you not love me? do you not, indeed?\n"+
		"Well, do not then; for since you love me not,\n"+
		"I will not love myself. Do you not love me?\n"+
		"Nay, tell me if you speak in jest or no.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"Come, wilt thou see me ride?\n"+
		"And when I am on horseback, I will swear\n"+
		"I love thee infinitely. But hark you, Kate;\n"+
		"I must not have you henceforth question me\n"+
		"Whither I go, nor reason whereabout:\n"+
		"Whither I must, I must; and, to conclude,\n"+
		"This evening must I leave you, gentle Kate.\n"+
		"I know you wise, but yet no farther wise\n"+
		"Than Harry Percy's wife: constant you are,\n"+
		"But yet a woman: and for secrecy,\n"+
		"No lady closer; for I well believe\n"+
		"Thou wilt not utter what thou dost not know;\n"+
		"And so far will I trust thee, gentle Kate.\n"+
		"LADY PERCY\n"+
		"How! so far?\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"Not an inch further. But hark you, Kate:\n"+
		"Whither I go, thither shall you go too;\n"+
		"To-day will I set forth, to-morrow you.\n"+
		"Will this content you, Kate?\n"+
		"LADY PERCY\n"+
		"It must of force.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV. The Boar's-Head Tavern, Eastcheap.\n"+
		"Enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Ned, prithee, come out of that fat room, and lend me\n"+
		"thy hand to laugh a little.\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"Where hast been, Hal?\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"With three or four loggerheads amongst three or four\n"+
		"score hogsheads. I have sounded the very\n"+
		"base-string of humility. Sirrah, I am sworn brother\n"+
		"to a leash of drawers; and can call them all by\n"+
		"their christen names, as Tom, Dick, and Francis.\n"+
		"They take it already upon their salvation, that\n"+
		"though I be but the prince of Wales, yet I am king\n"+
		"of courtesy; and tell me flatly I am no proud Jack,\n"+
		"like Falstaff, but a Corinthian, a lad of mettle, a\n"+
		"good boy, by the Lord, so they call me, and when I\n"+
		"am king of England, I shall command all the good\n"+
		"lads in Eastcheap. They call drinking deep, dyeing\n"+
		"scarlet; and when you breathe in your watering, they\n"+
		"cry 'hem!' and bid you play it off. To conclude, I\n"+
		"am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour,\n"+
		"that I can drink with any tinker in his own language\n"+
		"during my life. I tell thee, Ned, thou hast lost\n"+
		"much honour, that thou wert not with me in this sweet\n"+
		"action. But, sweet Ned,--to sweeten which name of\n"+
		"Ned, I give thee this pennyworth of sugar, clapped\n"+
		"even now into my hand by an under-skinker, one that\n"+
		"never spake other English in his life than 'Eight\n"+
		"shillings and sixpence' and 'You are welcome,' with\n"+
		"this shrill addition, 'Anon, anon, sir! Score a pint\n"+
		"of bastard in the Half-Moon,' or so. But, Ned, to\n"+
		"drive away the time till Falstaff come, I prithee,\n"+
		"do thou stand in some by-room, while I question my\n"+
		"puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar; and do\n"+
		"thou never leave calling 'Francis,' that his tale\n"+
		"to me may be nothing but 'Anon.' Step aside, and\n"+
		"I'll show thee a precedent.\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"Francis!\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Thou art perfect.\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"Francis!\n"+
		"Exit POINS\n"+

		"FRANCIS\n"+
		"Anon, anon, sir. Look down into the Pomgarnet, Ralph.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Come hither, Francis.\n"+
		"FRANCIS\n"+
		"My lord?\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"How long hast thou to serve, Francis?\n"+
		"FRANCIS\n"+

		"POINS\n"+
		"[Within] Francis!\n"+
		"FRANCIS\n"+
		"Anon, anon, sir.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Five year! by'r lady, a long lease for the clinking\n"+

		"as to play the coward with thy indenture and show it\n"+
		"a fair pair of heels and run from it?\n"+
		"FRANCIS\n"+
		"O Lord, sir, I'll be sworn upon all the books in\n"+
		"England, I could find in my heart.\n"+

		"Let me see--about Michaelmas next I shall be--\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"[Within] Francis!\n"+
		"FRANCIS\n"+
		"Anon, sir. Pray stay a little, my lord.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Nay, but hark you, Francis: for the sugar thou\n"+
		"gavest me,'twas a pennyworth, wast't not?\n"+
		"FRANCIS\n"+
		"O Lord, I would it had been two!\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"I will give thee for it a thousand pound: ask me\n"+

		"Wilt thou rob this leathern jerkin, crystal-button,\n"+
		"not-pated, agate-ring, puke-stocking, caddis-garter,\n"+
		"smooth-tongue, Spanish-pouch,--\n"+
		"FRANCIS\n"+
		"O Lord, sir, who do you mean?\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Why, then, your brown bastard is your only drink;\n"+
		"for look you, Francis, your white canvas doublet\n"+
		"will sully: in Barbary, sir, it cannot come to so much.\n"+
		"FRANCIS\n"+
		"What, sir?\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"[Within] Francis!\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Away, you rogue! dost thou not hear them call?\n"+
		"Here they both call him; the drawer stands amazed, not knowing which way to go\n"+
		"Enter Vintner\n"+
		"Vintner\n"+
		"What, standest thou still, and hearest such a\n"+
		"calling? Look to the guests within.\n"+
		"Exit Francis\n"+
		"My lord, old Sir John, with half-a-dozen more, are\n"+
		"at the door: shall I let them in?\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Let them alone awhile, and then open the door.\n"+
		"Exit Vintner\n"+
		"Poins!\n"+
		"Re-enter POINS\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"Anon, anon, sir.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Sirrah, Falstaff and the rest of the thieves are at\n"+
		"the door: shall we be merry?\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"As merry as crickets, my lad. But hark ye; what\n"+
		"cunning match have you made with this jest of the\n"+
		"drawer? come, what's the issue?\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"I am now of all humours that have showed themselves\n"+
		"humours since the old days of goodman Adam to the\n"+
		"pupil age of this present twelve o'clock at midnight.\n"+
		"Re-enter FRANCIS\n"+
		"What's o'clock, Francis?\n"+
		"FRANCIS\n"+
		"Anon, anon, sir.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"That ever this fellow should have fewer words than a\n"+
		"parrot, and yet the son of a woman! His industry is\n"+
		"upstairs and downstairs; his eloquence the parcel of\n"+
		"a reckoning. I am not yet of Percy's mind, the\n"+
		"Hotspur of the north; he that kills me some six or\n"+
		"seven dozen of Scots at a breakfast, washes his\n"+
		"hands, and says to his wife 'Fie upon this quiet\n"+
		"life! I want work.' 'O my sweet Harry,' says she,\n"+
		"'how many hast thou killed to-day?' 'Give my roan\n"+
		"horse a drench,' says he; and answers 'Some\n"+
		"fourteen,' an hour after; 'a trifle, a trifle.' I\n"+
		"prithee, call in Falstaff: I'll play Percy, and\n"+
		"that damned brawn shall play Dame Mortimer his\n"+
		"wife. 'Rivo!' says the drunkard. Call in ribs, call in tallow.\n"+
		"Enter FALSTAFF, GADSHILL, BARDOLPH, and PETO; FRANCIS following with wine\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"Welcome, Jack: where hast thou been?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"A plague of all cowards, I say, and a vengeance too!\n"+
		"marry, and amen! Give me a cup of sack, boy. Ere I\n"+
		"lead this life long, I'll sew nether stocks and mend\n"+
		"them and foot them too. A plague of all cowards!\n"+
		"Give me a cup of sack, rogue. Is there no virtue extant?\n"+
		"He drinks\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Didst thou never see Titan kiss a dish of butter?\n"+
		"pitiful-hearted Titan, that melted at the sweet tale\n"+
		"of the sun's! if thou didst, then behold that compound.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"You rogue, here's lime in this sack too: there is\n"+
		"nothing but roguery to be found in villanous man:\n"+
		"yet a coward is worse than a cup of sack with lime\n"+
		"in it. A villanous coward! Go thy ways, old Jack;\n"+
		"die when thou wilt, if manhood, good manhood, be\n"+
		"not forgot upon the face of the earth, then am I a\n"+
		"shotten herring. There live not three good men\n"+
		"unhanged in England; and one of them is fat and\n"+
		"grows old: God help the while! a bad world, I say.\n"+
		"I would I were a weaver; I could sing psalms or any\n"+
		"thing. A plague of all cowards, I say still.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"How now, wool-sack! what mutter you?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"A king's son! If I do not beat thee out of thy\n"+
		"kingdom with a dagger of lath, and drive all thy\n"+
		"subjects afore thee like a flock of wild-geese,\n"+
		"I'll never wear hair on my face more. You Prince of Wales!\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Why, you whoreson round man, what's the matter?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Are not you a coward? answer me to that: and Poins there?\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"'Zounds, ye fat paunch, an ye call me coward, by the\n"+
		"Lord, I'll stab thee.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"I call thee coward! I'll see thee damned ere I call\n"+
		"thee coward: but I would give a thousand pound I\n"+
		"could run as fast as thou canst. You are straight\n"+
		"enough in the shoulders, you care not who sees your\n"+
		"back: call you that backing of your friends? A\n"+
		"plague upon such backing! give me them that will\n"+
		"face me. Give me a cup of sack: I am a rogue, if I\n"+
		"drunk to-day.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"O villain! thy lips are scarce wiped since thou\n"+
		"drunkest last.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"All's one for that.\n"+
		"He drinks\n"+
		"A plague of all cowards, still say I.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"What's the matter?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"What's the matter! there be four of us here have\n"+
		"ta'en a thousand pound this day morning.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Where is it, Jack? where is it?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Where is it! taken from us it is: a hundred upon\n"+
		"poor four of us.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"What, a hundred, man?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"I am a rogue, if I were not at half-sword with a\n"+
		"dozen of them two hours together. I have 'scaped by\n"+
		"miracle. I am eight times thrust through the\n"+
		"doublet, four through the hose; my buckler cut\n"+
		"through and through; my sword hacked like a\n"+
		"hand-saw--ecce signum! I never dealt better since\n"+
		"I was a man: all would not do. A plague of all\n"+
		"cowards! Let them speak: if they speak more or\n"+
		"less than truth, they are villains and the sons of darkness.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Speak, sirs; how was it?\n"+
		"GADSHILL\n"+
		"We four set upon some dozen--\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Sixteen at least, my lord.\n"+
		"GADSHILL\n"+
		"And bound them.\n"+
		"PETO\n"+
		"No, no, they were not bound.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"You rogue, they were bound, every man of them; or I\n"+
		"am a Jew else, an Ebrew Jew.\n"+
		"GADSHILL\n"+
		"As we were sharing, some six or seven fresh men set upon us--\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"And unbound the rest, and then come in the other.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"What, fought you with them all?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"All! I know not what you call all; but if I fought\n"+
		"not with fifty of them, I am a bunch of radish: if\n"+
		"there were not two or three and fifty upon poor old\n"+
		"Jack, then am I no two-legged creature.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Pray God you have not murdered some of them.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Nay, that's past praying for: I have peppered two\n"+
		"of them; two I am sure I have paid, two rogues\n"+
		"in buckram suits. I tell thee what, Hal, if I tell\n"+
		"thee a lie, spit in my face, call me horse. Thou\n"+
		"knowest my old ward; here I lay and thus I bore my\n"+
		"point. Four rogues in buckram let drive at me--\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"What, four? thou saidst but two even now.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Four, Hal; I told thee four.\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"Ay, ay, he said four.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"These four came all a-front, and mainly thrust at\n"+
		"me. I made me no more ado but took all their seven\n"+
		"points in my target, thus.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Seven? why, there were but four even now.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"In buckram?\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"Ay, four, in buckram suits.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Seven, by these hilts, or I am a villain else.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Prithee, let him alone; we shall have more anon.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Dost thou hear me, Hal?\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Ay, and mark thee too, Jack.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Do so, for it is worth the listening to. These nine\n"+
		"in buckram that I told thee of--\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"So, two more already.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Their points being broken,--\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"Down fell their hose.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Began to give me ground: but I followed me close,\n"+
		"came in foot and hand; and with a thought seven of\n"+
		"the eleven I paid.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"O monstrous! eleven buckram men grown out of two!\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"But, as the devil would have it, three misbegotten\n"+
		"knaves in Kendal green came at my back and let drive\n"+
		"at me; for it was so dark, Hal, that thou couldst\n"+
		"not see thy hand.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"These lies are like their father that begets them;\n"+
		"gross as a mountain, open, palpable. Why, thou\n"+
		"clay-brained guts, thou knotty-pated fool, thou\n"+
		"whoreson, obscene, grease tallow-catch,--\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"What, art thou mad? art thou mad? is not the truth\n"+
		"the truth?\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Why, how couldst thou know these men in Kendal\n"+
		"green, when it was so dark thou couldst not see thy\n"+
		"hand? come, tell us your reason: what sayest thou to this?\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"Come, your reason, Jack, your reason.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"What, upon compulsion? 'Zounds, an I were at the\n"+
		"strappado, or all the racks in the world, I would\n"+
		"not tell you on compulsion. Give you a reason on\n"+
		"compulsion! If reasons were as plentiful as\n"+
		"blackberries, I would give no man a reason upon\n"+
		"compulsion, I.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"I'll be no longer guilty of this sin; this sanguine\n"+
		"coward, this bed-presser, this horseback-breaker,\n"+
		"this huge hill of flesh,--\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"'Sblood, you starveling, you elf-skin, you dried\n"+
		"neat's tongue, you bull's pizzle, you stock-fish! O\n"+
		"for breath to utter what is like thee! you\n"+
		"tailor's-yard, you sheath, you bowcase; you vile\n"+
		"standing-tuck,--\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Well, breathe awhile, and then to it again: and\n"+
		"when thou hast tired thyself in base comparisons,\n"+
		"hear me speak but this.\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"Mark, Jack.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"We two saw you four set on four and bound them, and\n"+
		"were masters of their wealth. Mark now, how a plain\n"+
		"tale shall put you down. Then did we two set on you\n"+
		"four; and, with a word, out-faced you from your\n"+
		"prize, and have it; yea, and can show it you here in\n"+
		"the house: and, Falstaff, you carried your guts\n"+
		"away as nimbly, with as quick dexterity, and roared\n"+
		"for mercy and still run and roared, as ever I heard\n"+
		"bull-calf. What a slave art thou, to hack thy sword\n"+
		"as thou hast done, and then say it was in fight!\n"+
		"What trick, what device, what starting-hole, canst\n"+
		"thou now find out to hide thee from this open and\n"+
		"apparent shame?\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"Come, let's hear, Jack; what trick hast thou now?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"By the Lord, I knew ye as well as he that made ye.\n"+
		"Why, hear you, my masters: was it for me to kill the\n"+
		"heir-apparent? should I turn upon the true prince?\n"+
		"why, thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules: but\n"+
		"beware instinct; the lion will not touch the true\n"+
		"prince. Instinct is a great matter; I was now a\n"+
		"coward on instinct. I shall think the better of\n"+
		"myself and thee during my life; I for a valiant\n"+
		"lion, and thou for a true prince. But, by the Lord,\n"+
		"lads, I am glad you have the money. Hostess, clap\n"+
		"to the doors: watch to-night, pray to-morrow.\n"+
		"Gallants, lads, boys, hearts of gold, all the titles\n"+
		"of good fellowship come to you! What, shall we be\n"+
		"merry? shall we have a play extempore?\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Content; and the argument shall be thy running away.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Ah, no more of that, Hal, an thou lovest me!\n"+
		"Enter Hostess\n"+
		"Hostess\n"+
		"O Jesu, my lord the prince!\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"How now, my lady the hostess! what sayest thou to\n"+
		"me?\n"+
		"Hostess\n"+
		"Marry, my lord, there is a nobleman of the court at\n"+
		"door would speak with you: he says he comes from\n"+
		"your father.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Give him as much as will make him a royal man, and\n"+
		"send him back again to my mother.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"What manner of man is he?\n"+
		"Hostess\n"+
		"An old man.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"What doth gravity out of his bed at midnight? Shall\n"+
		"I give him his answer?\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Prithee, do, Jack.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"'Faith, and I'll send him packing.\n"+
		"Exit FALSTAFF\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Now, sirs: by'r lady, you fought fair; so did you,\n"+
		"Peto; so did you, Bardolph: you are lions too, you\n"+
		"ran away upon instinct, you will not touch the true\n"+
		"prince; no, fie!\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"'Faith, I ran when I saw others run.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"'Faith, tell me now in earnest, how came Falstaff's\n"+
		"sword so hacked?\n"+
		"PETO\n"+
		"Why, he hacked it with his dagger, and said he would\n"+
		"swear truth out of England but he would make you\n"+
		"believe it was done in fight, and persuaded us to do the like.\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Yea, and to tickle our noses with spear-grass to\n"+
		"make them bleed, and then to beslubber our garments\n"+
		"with it and swear it was the blood of true men. I\n"+
		"did that I did not this seven year before, I blushed\n"+
		"to hear his monstrous devices.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"O villain, thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years\n"+
		"ago, and wert taken with the manner, and ever since\n"+
		"thou hast blushed extempore. Thou hadst fire and\n"+
		"sword on thy side, and yet thou rannest away: what\n"+
		"instinct hadst thou for it?\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"My lord, do you see these meteors? do you behold\n"+
		"these exhalations?\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"I do.\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"What think you they portend?\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Hot livers and cold purses.\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Choler, my lord, if rightly taken.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"No, if rightly taken, halter.\n"+
		"Re-enter FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Here comes lean Jack, here comes bare-bone.\n"+
		"How now, my sweet creature of bombast!\n"+
		"How long is't ago, Jack, since thou sawest thine own knee?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"My own knee! when I was about thy years, Hal, I was\n"+
		"not an eagle's talon in the waist; I could have\n"+
		"crept into any alderman's thumb-ring: a plague of\n"+
		"sighing and grief! it blows a man up like a\n"+
		"bladder. There's villanous news abroad: here was\n"+
		"Sir John Bracy from your father; you must to the\n"+
		"court in the morning. That same mad fellow of the\n"+
		"north, Percy, and he of Wales, that gave Amamon the\n"+
		"bastinado and made Lucifer cuckold and swore the\n"+
		"devil his true liegeman upon the cross of a Welsh\n"+
		"hook--what a plague call you him?\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"O, Glendower.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Owen, Owen, the same; and his son-in-law Mortimer,\n"+
		"and old Northumberland, and that sprightly Scot of\n"+
		"Scots, Douglas, that runs o' horseback up a hill\n"+
		"perpendicular,--\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"He that rides at high speed and with his pistol\n"+
		"kills a sparrow flying.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"You have hit it.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"So did he never the sparrow.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Well, that rascal hath good mettle in him; he will not run.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Why, what a rascal art thou then, to praise him so\n"+
		"for running!\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"O' horseback, ye cuckoo; but afoot he will not budge a foot.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Yes, Jack, upon instinct.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"I grant ye, upon instinct. Well, he is there too,\n"+
		"and one Mordake, and a thousand blue-caps more:\n"+
		"Worcester is stolen away to-night; thy father's\n"+
		"beard is turned white with the news: you may buy\n"+
		"land now as cheap as stinking mackerel.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Why, then, it is like, if there come a hot June and\n"+
		"this civil buffeting hold, we shall buy maidenheads\n"+
		"as they buy hob-nails, by the hundreds.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"By the mass, lad, thou sayest true; it is like we\n"+
		"shall have good trading that way. But tell me, Hal,\n"+
		"art not thou horrible afeard? thou being\n"+
		"heir-apparent, could the world pick thee out three\n"+
		"such enemies again as that fiend Douglas, that\n"+
		"spirit Percy, and that devil Glendower? Art thou\n"+
		"not horribly afraid? doth not thy blood thrill at\n"+
		"it?\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Not a whit, i' faith; I lack some of thy instinct.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Well, thou wert be horribly chid tomorrow when thou\n"+
		"comest to thy father: if thou love me, practise an answer.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Do thou stand for my father, and examine me upon the\n"+
		"particulars of my life.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Shall I? content: this chair shall be my state,\n"+
		"this dagger my sceptre, and this cushion my crown.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Thy state is taken for a joined-stool, thy golden\n"+
		"sceptre for a leaden dagger, and thy precious rich\n"+
		"crown for a pitiful bald crown!\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Well, an the fire of grace be not quite out of thee,\n"+
		"now shalt thou be moved. Give me a cup of sack to\n"+
		"make my eyes look red, that it may be thought I have\n"+
		"wept; for I must speak in passion, and I will do it\n"+
		"in King Cambyses' vein.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Well, here is my leg.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"And here is my speech. Stand aside, nobility.\n"+
		"Hostess\n"+
		"O Jesu, this is excellent sport, i' faith!\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Weep not, sweet queen; for trickling tears are vain.\n"+
		"Hostess\n"+
		"O, the father, how he holds his countenance!\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"For God's sake, lords, convey my tristful queen;\n"+
		"For tears do stop the flood-gates of her eyes.\n"+
		"Hostess\n"+
		"O Jesu, he doth it as like one of these harlotry\n"+
		"players as ever I see!\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Peace, good pint-pot; peace, good tickle-brain.\n"+
		"Harry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy\n"+
		"time, but also how thou art accompanied: for though\n"+
		"the camomile, the more it is trodden on the faster\n"+
		"it grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted the\n"+
		"sooner it wears. That thou art my son, I have\n"+
		"partly thy mother's word, partly my own opinion,\n"+
		"but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a\n"+
		"foolish-hanging of thy nether lip, that doth warrant\n"+
		"me. If then thou be son to me, here lies the point;\n"+
		"why, being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall\n"+
		"the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat\n"+
		"blackberries? a question not to be asked. Shall\n"+
		"the sun of England prove a thief and take purses? a\n"+
		"question to be asked. There is a thing, Harry,\n"+
		"which thou hast often heard of and it is known to\n"+
		"many in our land by the name of pitch: this pitch,\n"+
		"as ancient writers do report, doth defile; so doth\n"+
		"the company thou keepest: for, Harry, now I do not\n"+
		"speak to thee in drink but in tears, not in\n"+
		"pleasure but in passion, not in words only, but in\n"+
		"woes also: and yet there is a virtuous man whom I\n"+
		"have often noted in thy company, but I know not his name.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"What manner of man, an it like your majesty?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"A goodly portly man, i' faith, and a corpulent; of a\n"+
		"cheerful look, a pleasing eye and a most noble\n"+
		"carriage; and, as I think, his age some fifty, or,\n"+
		"by'r lady, inclining to three score; and now I\n"+
		"remember me, his name is Falstaff: if that man\n"+
		"should be lewdly given, he deceiveth me; for, Harry,\n"+
		"I see virtue in his looks. If then the tree may be\n"+
		"known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then,\n"+
		"peremptorily I speak it, there is virtue in that\n"+
		"Falstaff: him keep with, the rest banish. And tell\n"+
		"me now, thou naughty varlet, tell me, where hast\n"+
		"thou been this month?\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Dost thou speak like a king? Do thou stand for me,\n"+
		"and I'll play my father.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Depose me? if thou dost it half so gravely, so\n"+
		"majestically, both in word and matter, hang me up by\n"+
		"the heels for a rabbit-sucker or a poulter's hare.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Well, here I am set.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"And here I stand: judge, my masters.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Now, Harry, whence come you?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"My noble lord, from Eastcheap.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"The complaints I hear of thee are grievous.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"'Sblood, my lord, they are false: nay, I'll tickle\n"+
		"ye for a young prince, i' faith.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Swearest thou, ungracious boy? henceforth ne'er look\n"+
		"on me. Thou art violently carried away from grace:\n"+
		"there is a devil haunts thee in the likeness of an\n"+
		"old fat man; a tun of man is thy companion. Why\n"+
		"dost thou converse with that trunk of humours, that\n"+
		"bolting-hutch of beastliness, that swollen parcel\n"+
		"of dropsies, that huge bombard of sack, that stuffed\n"+
		"cloak-bag of guts, that roasted Manningtree ox with\n"+
		"the pudding in his belly, that reverend vice, that\n"+
		"grey iniquity, that father ruffian, that vanity in\n"+
		"years? Wherein is he good, but to taste sack and\n"+
		"drink it? wherein neat and cleanly, but to carve a\n"+
		"capon and eat it? wherein cunning, but in craft?\n"+
		"wherein crafty, but in villany? wherein villanous,\n"+
		"but in all things? wherein worthy, but in nothing?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"I would your grace would take me with you: whom\n"+
		"means your grace?\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"That villanous abominable misleader of youth,\n"+
		"Falstaff, that old white-bearded Satan.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"My lord, the man I know.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"I know thou dost.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"But to say I know more harm in him than in myself,\n"+
		"were to say more than I know. That he is old, the\n"+
		"more the pity, his white hairs do witness it; but\n"+
		"that he is, saving your reverence, a whoremaster,\n"+
		"that I utterly deny. If sack and sugar be a fault,\n"+
		"God help the wicked! if to be old and merry be a\n"+
		"sin, then many an old host that I know is damned: if\n"+
		"to be fat be to be hated, then Pharaoh's lean kine\n"+
		"are to be loved. No, my good lord; banish Peto,\n"+
		"banish Bardolph, banish Poins: but for sweet Jack\n"+
		"Falstaff, kind Jack Falstaff, true Jack Falstaff,\n"+
		"valiant Jack Falstaff, and therefore more valiant,\n"+
		"being, as he is, old Jack Falstaff, banish not him\n"+
		"thy Harry's company, banish not him thy Harry's\n"+
		"company: banish plump Jack, and banish all the world.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"I do, I will.\n"+
		"A knocking heard\n"+
		"Exeunt Hostess, FRANCIS, and BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Re-enter BARDOLPH, running\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"O, my lord, my lord! the sheriff with a most\n"+
		"monstrous watch is at the door.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Out, ye rogue! Play out the play: I have much to\n"+
		"say in the behalf of that Falstaff.\n"+
		"Re-enter the Hostess\n"+
		"Hostess\n"+
		"O Jesu, my lord, my lord!\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Heigh, heigh! the devil rides upon a fiddlestick:\n"+
		"what's the matter?\n"+
		"Hostess\n"+
		"The sheriff and all the watch are at the door: they\n"+
		"are come to search the house. Shall I let them in?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Dost thou hear, Hal? never call a true piece of\n"+
		"gold a counterfeit: thou art essentially mad,\n"+
		"without seeming so.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"And thou a natural coward, without instinct.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"I deny your major: if you will deny the sheriff,\n"+
		"so; if not, let him enter: if I become not a cart\n"+
		"as well as another man, a plague on my bringing up!\n"+
		"I hope I shall as soon be strangled with a halter as another.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Go, hide thee behind the arras: the rest walk up\n"+
		"above. Now, my masters, for a true face and good\n"+
		"conscience.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Both which I have had: but their date is out, and\n"+
		"therefore I'll hide me.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Call in the sheriff.\n"+
		"Exeunt all except PRINCE HENRY and PETO\n"+
		"Enter Sheriff and the Carrier\n"+
		"Now, master sheriff, what is your will with me?\n"+
		"Sheriff\n"+
		"First, pardon me, my lord. A hue and cry\n"+
		"Hath follow'd certain men unto this house.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"What men?\n"+
		"Sheriff\n"+
		"One of them is well known, my gracious lord,\n"+
		"A gross fat man.\n"+
		"Carrier\n"+
		"As fat as butter.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"The man, I do assure you, is not here;\n"+
		"For I myself at this time have employ'd him.\n"+
		"And, sheriff, I will engage my word to thee\n"+
		"That I will, by to-morrow dinner-time,\n"+
		"Send him to answer thee, or any man,\n"+
		"For any thing he shall be charged withal:\n"+
		"And so let me entreat you leave the house.\n"+
		"Sheriff\n"+
		"I will, my lord. There are two gentlemen\n"+
		"Have in this robbery lost three hundred marks.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"It may be so: if he have robb'd these men,\n"+
		"He shall be answerable; and so farewell.\n"+
		"Sheriff\n"+
		"Good night, my noble lord.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"I think it is good morrow, is it not?\n"+
		"Sheriff\n"+
		"Indeed, my lord, I think it be two o'clock.\n"+
		"Exeunt Sheriff and Carrier\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"This oily rascal is known as well as Paul's. Go,\n"+
		"call him forth.\n"+
		"PETO\n"+
		"Falstaff!--Fast asleep behind the arras, and\n"+
		"snorting like a horse.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Hark, how hard he fetches breath. Search his pockets.\n"+
		"He searcheth his pockets, and findeth certain papers\n"+
		"What hast thou found?\n"+
		"PETO\n"+
		"Nothing but papers, my lord.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Let's see what they be: read them.\n"+
		"PETO\n"+
		"[Reads] Item, A capon,. . 2s. 2d.\n"+
		"Item, Sauce,. . . 4d.\n"+
		"Item, Sack, two gallons, 5s. 8d.\n"+
		"Item, Anchovies and sack after supper, 2s. 6d.\n"+
		"Item, Bread, ob.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"O monstrous! but one half-penny-worth of bread to\n"+
		"this intolerable deal of sack! What there is else,\n"+
		"keep close; we'll read it at more advantage: there\n"+
		"let him sleep till day. I'll to the court in the\n"+
		"morning. We must all to the wars, and thy place\n"+
		"shall be honourable. I'll procure this fat rogue a\n"+
		"charge of foot; and I know his death will be a\n"+
		"march of twelve-score. The money shall be paid\n"+
		"back again with advantage. Be with me betimes in\n"+
		"the morning; and so, good morrow, Peto.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"PETO\n"+
		"Good morrow, good my lord.\n"+
		"ACT III\n"+
		"SCENE I. Bangor. The Archdeacon's house.\n"+
		"Enter HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, MORTIMER, and GLENDOWER\n"+
		"MORTIMER\n"+
		"These promises are fair, the parties sure,\n"+
		"And our induction full of prosperous hope.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"Lord Mortimer, and cousin Glendower,\n"+
		"Will you sit down?\n"+
		"And uncle Worcester: a plague upon it!\n"+
		"I have forgot the map.\n"+
		"GLENDOWER\n"+
		"No, here it is.\n"+
		"Sit, cousin Percy; sit, good cousin Hotspur,\n"+
		"For by that name as oft as Lancaster\n"+
		"Doth speak of you, his cheek looks pale and with\n"+
		"A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"And you in hell, as oft as he hears Owen Glendower spoke of.\n"+
		"GLENDOWER\n"+
		"I cannot blame him: at my nativity\n"+
		"The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,\n"+
		"Of burning cressets; and at my birth\n"+
		"The frame and huge foundation of the earth\n"+
		"Shaked like a coward.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"Why, so it would have done at the same season, if\n"+
		"your mother's cat had but kittened, though yourself\n"+
		"had never been born.\n"+
		"GLENDOWER\n"+
		"I say the earth did shake when I was born.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"And I say the earth was not of my mind,\n"+
		"If you suppose as fearing you it shook.\n"+
		"GLENDOWER\n"+
		"The heavens were all on fire, the earth did tremble.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"O, then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire,\n"+
		"And not in fear of your nativity.\n"+
		"Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth\n"+
		"In strange eruptions; oft the teeming earth\n"+
		"Is with a kind of colic pinch'd and vex'd\n"+
		"By the imprisoning of unruly wind\n"+
		"Within her womb; which, for enlargement striving,\n"+
		"Shakes the old beldam earth and topples down\n"+
		"Steeples and moss-grown towers. At your birth\n"+
		"Our grandam earth, having this distemperature,\n"+
		"In passion shook.\n"+
		"GLENDOWER\n"+
		"Cousin, of many men\n"+
		"I do not bear these crossings. Give me leave\n"+
		"To tell you once again that at my birth\n"+
		"The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,\n"+
		"The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds\n"+
		"Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields.\n"+
		"These signs have mark'd me extraordinary;\n"+
		"And all the courses of my life do show\n"+
		"I am not in the roll of common men.\n"+
		"Where is he living, clipp'd in with the sea\n"+
		"That chides the banks of England, Scotland, Wales,\n"+
		"Which calls me pupil, or hath read to me?\n"+
		"And bring him out that is but woman's son\n"+
		"Can trace me in the tedious ways of art\n"+
		"And hold me pace in deep experiments.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"I think there's no man speaks better Welsh.\n"+
		"I'll to dinner.\n"+
		"MORTIMER\n"+
		"Peace, cousin Percy; you will make him mad.\n"+
		"GLENDOWER\n"+
		"I can call spirits from the vasty deep.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"Why, so can I, or so can any man;\n"+
		"But will they come when you do call for them?\n"+
		"GLENDOWER\n"+
		"Why, I can teach you, cousin, to command\n"+
		"The devil.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"And I can teach thee, coz, to shame the devil\n"+
		"By telling truth: tell truth and shame the devil.\n"+
		"If thou have power to raise him, bring him hither,\n"+
		"And I'll be sworn I have power to shame him hence.\n"+
		"O, while you live, tell truth and shame the devil!\n"+
		"MORTIMER\n"+
		"Come, come, no more of this unprofitable chat.\n"+
		"GLENDOWER\n"+
		"Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head\n"+
		"Against my power; thrice from the banks of Wye\n"+
		"And sandy-bottom'd Severn have I sent him\n"+
		"Bootless home and weather-beaten back.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"Home without boots, and in foul weather too!\n"+
		"How 'scapes he agues, in the devil's name?\n"+
		"GLENDOWER\n"+
		"Come, here's the map: shall we divide our right\n"+
		"According to our threefold order ta'en?\n"+
		"MORTIMER\n"+
		"The archdeacon hath divided it\n"+
		"Into three limits very equally:\n"+
		"England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,\n"+
		"By south and east is to my part assign'd:\n"+
		"All westward, Wales beyond the Severn shore,\n"+
		"And all the fertile land within that bound,\n"+
		"To Owen Glendower: and, dear coz, to you\n"+
		"The remnant northward, lying off from Trent.\n"+
		"And our indentures tripartite are drawn;\n"+
		"Which being sealed interchangeably,\n"+
		"A business that this night may execute,\n"+
		"To-morrow, cousin Percy, you and I\n"+
		"And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth\n"+
		"To meet your father and the Scottish power,\n"+
		"As is appointed us, at Shrewsbury.\n"+
		"My father Glendower is not ready yet,\n"+
		"Not shall we need his help these fourteen days.\n"+
		"Within that space you may have drawn together\n"+
		"Your tenants, friends and neighbouring gentlemen.\n"+
		"GLENDOWER\n"+
		"A shorter time shall send me to you, lords:\n"+
		"And in my conduct shall your ladies come;\n"+
		"From whom you now must steal and take no leave,\n"+
		"For there will be a world of water shed\n"+
		"Upon the parting of your wives and you.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"Methinks my moiety, north from Burton here,\n"+
		"In quantity equals not one of yours:\n"+
		"See how this river comes me cranking in,\n"+
		"And cuts me from the best of all my land\n"+
		"A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out.\n"+
		"I'll have the current in this place damm'd up;\n"+
		"And here the smug and silver Trent shall run\n"+
		"In a new channel, fair and evenly;\n"+
		"It shall not wind with such a deep indent,\n"+
		"To rob me of so rich a bottom here.\n"+
		"GLENDOWER\n"+
		"Not wind? it shall, it must; you see it doth.\n"+
		"MORTIMER\n"+
		"Yea, but\n"+
		"Mark how he bears his course, and runs me up\n"+
		"With like advantage on the other side;\n"+
		"Gelding the opposed continent as much\n"+
		"As on the other side it takes from you.\n"+
		"EARL OF WORCESTER\n"+
		"Yea, but a little charge will trench him here\n"+
		"And on this north side win this cape of land;\n"+
		"And then he runs straight and even.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"I'll have it so: a little charge will do it.\n"+
		"GLENDOWER\n"+
		"I'll not have it alter'd.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"Will not you?\n"+
		"GLENDOWER\n"+
		"No, nor you shall not.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"Who shall say me nay?\n"+
		"GLENDOWER\n"+
		"Why, that will I.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"Let me not understand you, then; speak it in Welsh.\n"+
		"GLENDOWER\n"+
		"I can speak English, lord, as well as you;\n"+
		"For I was train'd up in the English court;\n"+
		"Where, being but young, I framed to the harp\n"+
		"Many an English ditty lovely well\n"+
		"And gave the tongue a helpful ornament,\n"+
		"A virtue that was never seen in you.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"Marry,\n"+
		"And I am glad of it with all my heart:\n"+
		"I had rather be a kitten and cry mew\n"+
		"Than one of these same metre ballad-mongers;\n"+
		"I had rather hear a brazen canstick turn'd,\n"+
		"Or a dry wheel grate on the axle-tree;\n"+
		"And that would set my teeth nothing on edge,\n"+
		"Nothing so much as mincing poetry:\n"+
		"'Tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag.\n"+
		"GLENDOWER\n"+
		"Come, you shall have Trent turn'd.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"I do not care: I'll give thrice so much land\n"+
		"To any well-deserving friend;\n"+
		"But in the way of bargain, mark ye me,\n"+
		"I'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair.\n"+
		"Are the indentures drawn? shall we be gone?\n"+
		"GLENDOWER\n"+
		"The moon shines fair; you may away by night:\n"+
		"I'll haste the writer and withal\n"+
		"Break with your wives of your departure hence:\n"+
		"I am afraid my daughter will run mad,\n"+
		"So much she doteth on her Mortimer.\n"+
		"Exit GLENDOWER\n"+
		"MORTIMER\n"+
		"Fie, cousin Percy! how you cross my father!\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"I cannot choose: sometime he angers me\n"+
		"With telling me of the mouldwarp and the ant,\n"+
		"Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies,\n"+
		"And of a dragon and a finless fish,\n"+
		"A clip-wing'd griffin and a moulten raven,\n"+
		"A couching lion and a ramping cat,\n"+
		"And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff\n"+
		"As puts me from my faith. I tell you what;\n"+
		"He held me last night at least nine hours\n"+
		"In reckoning up the several devils' names\n"+
		"That were his lackeys: I cried 'hum,' and 'well, go to,'\n"+
		"But mark'd him not a word. O, he is as tedious\n"+
		"As a tired horse, a railing wife;\n"+
		"Worse than a smoky house: I had rather live\n"+
		"With cheese and garlic in a windmill, far,\n"+
		"Than feed on cates and have him talk to me\n"+
		"In any summer-house in Christendom.\n"+
		"MORTIMER\n"+
		"In faith, he is a worthy gentleman,\n"+
		"Exceedingly well read, and profited\n"+
		"In strange concealments, valiant as a lion\n"+
		"And as wondrous affable and as bountiful\n"+
		"As mines of India. Shall I tell you, cousin?\n"+
		"He holds your temper in a high respect\n"+
		"And curbs himself even of his natural scope\n"+
		"When you come 'cross his humour; faith, he does:\n"+
		"I warrant you, that man is not alive\n"+
		"Might so have tempted him as you have done,\n"+
		"Without the taste of danger and reproof:\n"+
		"But do not use it oft, let me entreat you.\n"+
		"EARL OF WORCESTER\n"+
		"In faith, my lord, you are too wilful-blame;\n"+
		"And since your coming hither have done enough\n"+
		"To put him quite beside his patience.\n"+
		"You must needs learn, lord, to amend this fault:\n"+
		"Though sometimes it show greatness, courage, blood,--\n"+
		"And that's the dearest grace it renders you,--\n"+
		"Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage,\n"+
		"Defect of manners, want of government,\n"+
		"Pride, haughtiness, opinion and disdain:\n"+
		"The least of which haunting a nobleman\n"+
		"Loseth men's hearts and leaves behind a stain\n"+
		"Upon the beauty of all parts besides,\n"+
		"Beguiling them of commendation.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"Well, I am school'd: good manners be your speed!\n"+
		"Here come our wives, and let us take our leave.\n"+
		"Re-enter GLENDOWER with the ladies\n"+
		"MORTIMER\n"+
		"This is the deadly spite that angers me;\n"+
		"My wife can speak no English, I no Welsh.\n"+
		"GLENDOWER\n"+
		"My daughter weeps: she will not part with you;\n"+
		"She'll be a soldier too, she'll to the wars.\n"+
		"MORTIMER\n"+
		"Good father, tell her that she and my aunt Percy\n"+
		"Shall follow in your conduct speedily.\n"+
		"Glendower speaks to her in Welsh, and she answers him in the same\n"+
		"GLENDOWER\n"+
		"She is desperate here; a peevish self-wind harlotry,\n"+
		"one that no persuasion can do good upon.\n"+
		"The lady speaks in Welsh\n"+
		"MORTIMER\n"+
		"I understand thy looks: that pretty Welsh\n"+
		"Which thou pour'st down from these swelling heavens\n"+
		"I am too perfect in; and, but for shame,\n"+
		"In such a parley should I answer thee.\n"+
		"The lady speaks again in Welsh\n"+
		"I understand thy kisses and thou mine,\n"+
		"And that's a feeling disputation:\n"+
		"But I will never be a truant, love,\n"+
		"Till I have learned thy language; for thy tongue\n"+
		"Makes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly penn'd,\n"+
		"Sung by a fair queen in a summer's bower,\n"+
		"With ravishing division, to her lute.\n"+
		"GLENDOWER\n"+
		"Nay, if you melt, then will she run mad.\n"+
		"The lady speaks again in Welsh\n"+
		"MORTIMER\n"+
		"O, I am ignorance itself in this!\n"+
		"GLENDOWER\n"+
		"She bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down\n"+
		"And rest your gentle head upon her lap,\n"+
		"And she will sing the song that pleaseth you\n"+
		"And on your eyelids crown the god of sleep.\n"+
		"Charming your blood with pleasing heaviness,\n"+
		"Making such difference 'twixt wake and sleep\n"+
		"As is the difference betwixt day and night\n"+
		"The hour before the heavenly-harness'd team\n"+
		"Begins his golden progress in the east.\n"+
		"MORTIMER\n"+
		"With all my heart I'll sit and hear her sing:\n"+
		"By that time will our book, I think, be drawn\n"+
		"GLENDOWER\n"+
		"Do so;\n"+
		"And those musicians that shall play to you\n"+
		"Hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence,\n"+
		"And straight they shall be here: sit, and attend.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"Come, Kate, thou art perfect in lying down: come,\n"+
		"quick, quick, that I may lay my head in thy lap.\n"+
		"LADY PERCY\n"+
		"Go, ye giddy goose.\n"+
		"The music plays\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"Now I perceive the devil understands Welsh;\n"+
		"And 'tis no marvel he is so humorous.\n"+
		"By'r lady, he is a good musician.\n"+
		"LADY PERCY\n"+
		"Then should you be nothing but musical for you are\n"+
		"altogether governed by humours. Lie still, ye thief,\n"+
		"and hear the lady sing in Welsh.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"I had rather hear Lady, my brach, howl in Irish.\n"+
		"LADY PERCY\n"+
		"Wouldst thou have thy head broken?\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"No.\n"+
		"LADY PERCY\n"+
		"Then be still.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"Neither;'tis a woman's fault.\n"+
		"LADY PERCY\n"+
		"Now God help thee!\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"To the Welsh lady's bed.\n"+
		"LADY PERCY\n"+
		"What's that?\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"Peace! she sings.\n"+
		"Here the lady sings a Welsh song\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"Come, Kate, I'll have your song too.\n"+
		"LADY PERCY\n"+
		"Not mine, in good sooth.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"Not yours, in good sooth! Heart! you swear like a\n"+
		"comfit-maker's wife. 'Not you, in good sooth,' and\n"+
		"'as true as I live,' and 'as God shall mend me,' and\n"+
		"'as sure as day,'\n"+
		"And givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths,\n"+
		"As if thou never walk'st further than Finsbury.\n"+
		"Swear me, Kate, like a lady as thou art,\n"+
		"A good mouth-filling oath, and leave 'in sooth,'\n"+
		"And such protest of pepper-gingerbread,\n"+
		"To velvet-guards and Sunday-citizens.\n"+
		"Come, sing.\n"+
		"LADY PERCY\n"+
		"I will not sing.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"'Tis the next way to turn tailor, or be red-breast\n"+
		"teacher. An the indentures be drawn, I'll away\n"+
		"within these two hours; and so, come in when ye will.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"GLENDOWER\n"+
		"Come, come, Lord Mortimer; you are as slow\n"+
		"As hot Lord Percy is on fire to go.\n"+
		"By this our book is drawn; we'll but seal,\n"+
		"And then to horse immediately.\n"+
		"MORTIMER\n"+
		"With all my heart.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. London. The palace.\n"+
		"Enter KING HENRY IV, PRINCE HENRY, and others\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"Lords, give us leave; the Prince of Wales and I\n"+
		"Must have some private conference; but be near at hand,\n"+
		"For we shall presently have need of you.\n"+
		"Exeunt Lords\n"+
		"I know not whether God will have it so,\n"+
		"For some displeasing service I have done,\n"+
		"That, in his secret doom, out of my blood\n"+
		"He'll breed revengement and a scourge for me;\n"+
		"But thou dost in thy passages of life\n"+
		"Make me believe that thou art only mark'd\n"+
		"For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven\n"+
		"To punish my mistreadings. Tell me else,\n"+
		"Could such inordinate and low desires,\n"+
		"Such poor, such bare, such lewd, such mean attempts,\n"+
		"Such barren pleasures, rude society,\n"+
		"As thou art match'd withal and grafted to,\n"+
		"Accompany the greatness of thy blood\n"+
		"And hold their level with thy princely heart?\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"So please your majesty, I would I could\n"+
		"Quit all offences with as clear excuse\n"+
		"As well as I am doubtless I can purge\n"+
		"Myself of many I am charged withal:\n"+
		"Yet such extenuation let me beg,\n"+
		"As, in reproof of many tales devised,\n"+
		"which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear,\n"+
		"By smiling pick-thanks and base news-mongers,\n"+
		"I may, for some things true, wherein my youth\n"+
		"Hath faulty wander'd and irregular,\n"+
		"Find pardon on my true submission.\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"God pardon thee! yet let me wonder, Harry,\n"+
		"At thy affections, which do hold a wing\n"+
		"Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.\n"+
		"Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost.\n"+
		"Which by thy younger brother is supplied,\n"+
		"And art almost an alien to the hearts\n"+
		"Of all the court and princes of my blood:\n"+
		"The hope and expectation of thy time\n"+
		"Is ruin'd, and the soul of every man\n"+
		"Prophetically doth forethink thy fall.\n"+
		"Had I so lavish of my presence been,\n"+
		"So common-hackney'd in the eyes of men,\n"+
		"So stale and cheap to vulgar company,\n"+
		"Opinion, that did help me to the crown,\n"+
		"Had still kept loyal to possession\n"+
		"And left me in reputeless banishment,\n"+
		"A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.\n"+
		"By being seldom seen, I could not stir\n"+
		"But like a comet I was wonder'd at;\n"+
		"That men would tell their children 'This is he;'\n"+
		"Others would say 'Where, which is Bolingbroke?'\n"+
		"And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,\n"+
		"And dress'd myself in such humility\n"+
		"That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts,\n"+
		"Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,\n"+
		"Even in the presence of the crowned king.\n"+
		"Thus did I keep my person fresh and new;\n"+
		"My presence, like a robe pontifical,\n"+
		"Ne'er seen but wonder'd at: and so my state,\n"+
		"Seldom but sumptuous, showed like a feast\n"+
		"And won by rareness such solemnity.\n"+
		"The skipping king, he ambled up and down\n"+
		"With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,\n"+
		"Soon kindled and soon burnt; carded his state,\n"+
		"Mingled his royalty with capering fools,\n"+
		"Had his great name profaned with their scorns\n"+
		"And gave his countenance, against his name,\n"+
		"To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push\n"+
		"Of every beardless vain comparative,\n"+
		"Grew a companion to the common streets,\n"+
		"Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;\n"+
		"That, being daily swallow'd by men's eyes,\n"+
		"They surfeited with honey and began\n"+
		"To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little\n"+
		"More than a little is by much too much.\n"+
		"So when he had occasion to be seen,\n"+
		"He was but as the cuckoo is in June,\n"+
		"Heard, not regarded; seen, but with such eyes\n"+
		"As, sick and blunted with community,\n"+
		"Afford no extraordinary gaze,\n"+
		"Such as is bent on sun-like majesty\n"+
		"When it shines seldom in admiring eyes;\n"+
		"But rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down,\n"+
		"Slept in his face and render'd such aspect\n"+
		"As cloudy men use to their adversaries,\n"+
		"Being with his presence glutted, gorged and full.\n"+
		"And in that very line, Harry, standest thou;\n"+
		"For thou has lost thy princely privilege\n"+
		"With vile participation: not an eye\n"+
		"But is a-weary of thy common sight,\n"+
		"Save mine, which hath desired to see thee more;\n"+
		"Which now doth that I would not have it do,\n"+
		"Make blind itself with foolish tenderness.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"I shall hereafter, my thrice gracious lord,\n"+
		"Be more myself.\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"For all the world\n"+
		"As thou art to this hour was Richard then\n"+
		"When I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh,\n"+
		"And even as I was then is Percy now.\n"+
		"Now, by my sceptre and my soul to boot,\n"+
		"He hath more worthy interest to the state\n"+
		"Than thou the shadow of succession;\n"+
		"For of no right, nor colour like to right,\n"+
		"He doth fill fields with harness in the realm,\n"+
		"Turns head against the lion's armed jaws,\n"+
		"And, being no more in debt to years than thou,\n"+
		"Leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on\n"+
		"To bloody battles and to bruising arms.\n"+
		"What never-dying honour hath he got\n"+
		"Against renowned Douglas! whose high deeds,\n"+
		"Whose hot incursions and great name in arms\n"+
		"Holds from all soldiers chief majority\n"+
		"And military title capital\n"+
		"Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ:\n"+
		"Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes,\n"+
		"This infant warrior, in his enterprises\n"+
		"Discomfited great Douglas, ta'en him once,\n"+
		"Enlarged him and made a friend of him,\n"+
		"To fill the mouth of deep defiance up\n"+
		"And shake the peace and safety of our throne.\n"+
		"And what say you to this? Percy, Northumberland,\n"+
		"The Archbishop's grace of York, Douglas, Mortimer,\n"+
		"Capitulate against us and are up.\n"+
		"But wherefore do I tell these news to thee?\n"+
		"Why, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes,\n"+
		"Which art my near'st and dearest enemy?\n"+
		"Thou that art like enough, through vassal fear,\n"+
		"Base inclination and the start of spleen\n"+
		"To fight against me under Percy's pay,\n"+
		"To dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns,\n"+
		"To show how much thou art degenerate.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Do not think so; you shall not find it so:\n"+
		"And God forgive them that so much have sway'd\n"+
		"Your majesty's good thoughts away from me!\n"+
		"I will redeem all this on Percy's head\n"+
		"And in the closing of some glorious day\n"+
		"Be bold to tell you that I am your son;\n"+
		"When I will wear a garment all of blood\n"+
		"And stain my favours in a bloody mask,\n"+
		"Which, wash'd away, shall scour my shame with it:\n"+
		"And that shall be the day, whene'er it lights,\n"+
		"That this same child of honour and renown,\n"+
		"This gallant Hotspur, this all-praised knight,\n"+
		"And your unthought-of Harry chance to meet.\n"+
		"For every honour sitting on his helm,\n"+
		"Would they were multitudes, and on my head\n"+
		"My shames redoubled! for the time will come,\n"+
		"That I shall make this northern youth exchange\n"+
		"His glorious deeds for my indignities.\n"+
		"Percy is but my factor, good my lord,\n"+
		"To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf;\n"+
		"And I will call him to so strict account,\n"+
		"That he shall render every glory up,\n"+
		"Yea, even the slightest worship of his time,\n"+
		"Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart.\n"+
		"This, in the name of God, I promise here:\n"+
		"The which if He be pleased I shall perform,\n"+
		"I do beseech your majesty may salve\n"+
		"The long-grown wounds of my intemperance:\n"+
		"If not, the end of life cancels all bands;\n"+
		"And I will die a hundred thousand deaths\n"+
		"Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"A hundred thousand rebels die in this:\n"+
		"Thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein.\n"+
		"Enter BLUNT\n"+
		"How now, good Blunt? thy looks are full of speed.\n"+
		"SIR WALTER BLUNT\n"+
		"So hath the business that I come to speak of.\n"+
		"Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word\n"+
		"That Douglas and the English rebels met\n"+
		"The eleventh of this month at Shrewsbury\n"+
		"A mighty and a fearful head they are,\n"+
		"If promises be kept on every hand,\n"+
		"As ever offer'd foul play in the state.\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"The Earl of Westmoreland set forth to-day;\n"+
		"With him my son, Lord John of Lancaster;\n"+
		"For this advertisement is five days old:\n"+
		"On Wednesday next, Harry, you shall set forward;\n"+
		"On Thursday we ourselves will march: our meeting\n"+
		"Is Bridgenorth: and, Harry, you shall march\n"+
		"Through Gloucestershire; by which account,\n"+
		"Our business valued, some twelve days hence\n"+
		"Our general forces at Bridgenorth shall meet.\n"+
		"Our hands are full of business: let's away;\n"+
		"Advantage feeds him fat, while men delay.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"Scene III\n"+
		"Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.\n"+
		"Enter FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Bardolph, am I not fallen away vilely since this last\n"+
		"action? do I not bate? do I not dwindle? Why my\n"+
		"skin hangs about me like an like an old lady's loose\n"+
		"gown; I am withered like an old apple-john. Well,\n"+
		"I'll repent, and that suddenly, while I am in some\n"+
		"liking; I shall be out of heart shortly, and then I\n"+
		"shall have no strength to repent. An I have not\n"+
		"forgotten what the inside of a church is made of, I\n"+
		"am a peppercorn, a brewer's horse: the inside of a\n"+
		"church! Company, villanous company, hath been the\n"+
		"spoil of me.\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Sir John, you are so fretful, you cannot live long.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Why, there is it: come sing me a bawdy song; make\n"+
		"me merry. I was as virtuously given as a gentleman\n"+
		"need to be; virtuous enough; swore little; diced not\n"+
		"above seven times a week; went to a bawdy-house once\n"+
		"in a quarter--of an hour; paid money that I\n"+
		"borrowed, three of four times; lived well and in\n"+
		"good compass: and now I live out of all order, out\n"+
		"of all compass.\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Why, you are so fat, Sir John, that you must needs\n"+
		"be out of all compass, out of all reasonable\n"+
		"compass, Sir John.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Do thou amend thy face, and I'll amend my life:\n"+
		"thou art our admiral, thou bearest the lantern in\n"+
		"the poop, but 'tis in the nose of thee; thou art the\n"+
		"Knight of the Burning Lamp.\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Why, Sir John, my face does you no harm.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"No, I'll be sworn; I make as good use of it as many\n"+
		"a man doth of a Death's-head or a memento mori: I\n"+
		"never see thy face but I think upon hell-fire and\n"+
		"Dives that lived in purple; for there he is in his\n"+
		"robes, burning, burning. If thou wert any way\n"+
		"given to virtue, I would swear by thy face; my oath\n"+
		"should be 'By this fire, that's God's angel:' but\n"+
		"thou art altogether given over; and wert indeed, but\n"+
		"for the light in thy face, the son of utter\n"+
		"darkness. When thou rannest up Gadshill in the\n"+
		"night to catch my horse, if I did not think thou\n"+
		"hadst been an ignis fatuus or a ball of wildfire,\n"+
		"there's no purchase in money. O, thou art a\n"+
		"perpetual triumph, an everlasting bonfire-light!\n"+
		"Thou hast saved me a thousand marks in links and\n"+
		"torches, walking with thee in the night betwixt\n"+
		"tavern and tavern: but the sack that thou hast\n"+
		"drunk me would have bought me lights as good cheap\n"+
		"at the dearest chandler's in Europe. I have\n"+
		"maintained that salamander of yours with fire any\n"+
		"time this two and thirty years; God reward me for\n"+
		"it!\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"'Sblood, I would my face were in your belly!\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"God-a-mercy! so should I be sure to be heart-burned.\n"+
		"Enter Hostess\n"+
		"How now, Dame Partlet the hen! have you inquired\n"+
		"yet who picked my pocket?\n"+
		"Hostess\n"+
		"Why, Sir John, what do you think, Sir John? do you\n"+
		"think I keep thieves in my house? I have searched,\n"+
		"I have inquired, so has my husband, man by man, boy\n"+
		"by boy, servant by servant: the tithe of a hair\n"+
		"was never lost in my house before.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Ye lie, hostess: Bardolph was shaved and lost many\n"+
		"a hair; and I'll be sworn my pocket was picked. Go\n"+
		"to, you are a woman, go.\n"+
		"Hostess\n"+
		"Who, I? no; I defy thee: God's light, I was never\n"+
		"called so in mine own house before.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Go to, I know you well enough.\n"+
		"Hostess\n"+
		"No, Sir John; You do not know me, Sir John. I know\n"+
		"you, Sir John: you owe me money, Sir John; and now\n"+
		"you pick a quarrel to beguile me of it: I bought\n"+
		"you a dozen of shirts to your back.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Dowlas, filthy dowlas: I have given them away to\n"+
		"bakers' wives, and they have made bolters of them.\n"+
		"Hostess\n"+
		"Now, as I am a true woman, holland of eight\n"+
		"shillings an ell. You owe money here besides, Sir\n"+
		"John, for your diet and by-drinkings, and money lent\n"+
		"you, four and twenty pound.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"He had his part of it; let him pay.\n"+
		"Hostess\n"+
		"He? alas, he is poor; he hath nothing.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"How! poor? look upon his face; what call you rich?\n"+
		"let them coin his nose, let them coin his cheeks:\n"+
		"Ill not pay a denier. What, will you make a younker\n"+
		"of me? shall I not take mine case in mine inn but I\n"+
		"shall have my pocket picked? I have lost a\n"+
		"seal-ring of my grandfather's worth forty mark.\n"+
		"Hostess\n"+
		"O Jesu, I have heard the prince tell him, I know not\n"+
		"how oft, that ring was copper!\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"How! the prince is a Jack, a sneak-cup: 'sblood, an\n"+
		"he were here, I would cudgel him like a dog, if he\n"+
		"would say so.\n"+
		"Enter PRINCE HENRY and PETO, marching, and FALSTAFF meets them playing on his truncheon like a life\n"+
		"How now, lad! is the wind in that door, i' faith?\n"+
		"must we all march?\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Yea, two and two, Newgate fashion.\n"+
		"Hostess\n"+
		"My lord, I pray you, hear me.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"What sayest thou, Mistress Quickly? How doth thy\n"+
		"husband? I love him well; he is an honest man.\n"+
		"Hostess\n"+
		"Good my lord, hear me.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Prithee, let her alone, and list to me.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"What sayest thou, Jack?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"The other night I fell asleep here behind the arras\n"+
		"and had my pocket picked: this house is turned\n"+
		"bawdy-house; they pick pockets.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"What didst thou lose, Jack?\n"+

		"Wilt thou believe me, Hal? three or four bonds of\n"+
		"forty pound apiece, and a seal-ring of my\n"+
		"grandfather's.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"A trifle, some eight-penny matter.\n"+
		"Hostess\n"+
		"So I told him, my lord; and I said I heard your\n"+
		"grace say so: and, my lord, he speaks most vilely\n"+
		"of you, like a foul-mouthed man as he is; and said\n"+
		"he would cudgel you.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"What! he did not?\n"+
		"Hostess\n"+
		"There's neither faith, truth, nor womanhood in me else.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"There's no more faith in thee than in a stewed\n"+
		"prune; nor no more truth in thee than in a drawn\n"+
		"fox; and for womanhood, Maid Marian may be the\n"+
		"deputy's wife of the ward to thee. Go, you thing,\n"+
		"go\n"+
		"Hostess\n"+
		"Say, what thing? what thing?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"What thing! why, a thing to thank God on.\n"+
		"Hostess\n"+
		"I am no thing to thank God on, I would thou\n"+
		"shouldst know it; I am an honest man's wife: and,\n"+
		"setting thy knighthood aside, thou art a knave to\n"+
		"call me so.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Setting thy womanhood aside, thou art a beast to say\n"+
		"otherwise.\n"+
		"Hostess\n"+
		"Say, what beast, thou knave, thou?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"What beast! why, an otter.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"An otter, Sir John! Why an otter?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Why, she's neither fish nor flesh; a man knows not\n"+
		"where to have her.\n"+
		"Hostess\n"+
		"Thou art an unjust man in saying so: thou or any\n"+
		"man knows where to have me, thou knave, thou!\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Thou sayest true, hostess; and he slanders thee most grossly.\n"+
		"Hostess\n"+
		"So he doth you, my lord; and said this other day you\n"+
		"ought him a thousand pound.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"A thousand pound, Ha! a million: thy love is worth\n"+
		"a million: thou owest me thy love.\n"+
		"Hostess\n"+
		"Nay, my lord, he called you Jack, and said he would\n"+
		"cudgel you.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Did I, Bardolph?\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Indeed, Sir John, you said so.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Yea, if he said my ring was copper.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"I say 'tis copper: darest thou be as good as thy word now?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Why, Hal, thou knowest, as thou art but man, I dare:\n"+
		"but as thou art prince, I fear thee as I fear the\n"+
		"roaring of a lion's whelp.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"And why not as the lion?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"The king is to be feared as the lion: dost thou\n"+
		"think I'll fear thee as I fear thy father? nay, an\n"+
		"I do, I pray God my girdle break.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"O, if it should, how would thy guts fall about thy\n"+
		"knees! But, sirrah, there's no room for faith,\n"+
		"truth, nor honesty in this bosom of thine; it is all\n"+
		"filled up with guts and midriff. Charge an honest\n"+
		"woman with picking thy pocket! why, thou whoreson,\n"+
		"impudent, embossed rascal, if there were anything in\n"+
		"thy pocket but tavern-reckonings, memorandums of\n"+
		"bawdy-houses, and one poor penny-worth of\n"+
		"sugar-candy to make thee long-winded, if thy pocket\n"+
		"were enriched with any other injuries but these, I\n"+
		"am a villain: and yet you will stand to if; you will\n"+
		"not pocket up wrong: art thou not ashamed?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Dost thou hear, Hal? thou knowest in the state of\n"+
		"innocency Adam fell; and what should poor Jack\n"+
		"Falstaff do in the days of villany? Thou seest I\n"+
		"have more flesh than another man, and therefore more\n"+
		"frailty. You confess then, you picked my pocket?\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"It appears so by the story.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Hostess, I forgive thee: go, make ready breakfast;\n"+
		"love thy husband, look to thy servants, cherish thy\n"+
		"guests: thou shalt find me tractable to any honest\n"+
		"reason: thou seest I am pacified still. Nay,\n"+
		"prithee, be gone.\n"+
		"Exit Hostess\n"+
		"Now Hal, to the news at court: for the robbery,\n"+
		"lad, how is that answered?\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"O, my sweet beef, I must still be good angel to\n"+
		"thee: the money is paid back again.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"O, I do not like that paying back; 'tis a double labour.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"I am good friends with my father and may do any thing.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Rob me the exchequer the first thing thou doest, and\n"+

		"Do, my lord.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"I have procured thee, Jack, a charge of foot.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+

		"age of two and twenty or thereabouts! I am\n"+

		"Enter HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, and DOUGLAS\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"Well said, my noble Scot: if speaking truth\n"+
		"In this fine age were not thought flattery,\n"+
		"Such attribution should the Douglas have,\n"+
		"As not a soldier of this season's stamp\n"+
		"Should go so general current through the world.\n"+
		"By God, I cannot flatter; I do defy\n"+
		"The tongues of soothers; but a braver place\n"+
		"In my heart's love hath no man than yourself:\n"+
		"Nay, task me to my word; approve me, lord.\n"+
		"EARL OF DOUGLAS\n"+
		"Thou art the king of honour:\n"+
		"No man so potent breathes upon the ground\n"+
		"But I will beard him.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"Do so, and 'tis well.\n"+
		"Enter a Messenger with letters\n"+
		"What letters hast thou there?--I can but thank you.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"These letters come from your father.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"Letters from him! why comes he not himself?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"He cannot come, my lord; he is grievous sick.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"'Zounds! how has he the leisure to be sick\n"+
		"In such a rustling time? Who leads his power?\n"+
		"Under whose government come they along?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"His letters bear his mind, not I, my lord.\n"+
		"EARL OF WORCESTER\n"+
		"I prithee, tell me, doth he keep his bed?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"He did, my lord, four days ere I set forth;\n"+
		"And at the time of my departure thence\n"+
		"He was much fear'd by his physicians.\n"+
		"EARL OF WORCESTER\n"+
		"I would the state of time had first been whole\n"+
		"Ere he by sickness had been visited:\n"+
		"His health was never better worth than now.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"Sick now! droop now! this sickness doth infect\n"+
		"The very life-blood of our enterprise;\n"+
		"'Tis catching hither, even to our camp.\n"+
		"He writes me here, that inward sickness--\n"+
		"And that his friends by deputation could not\n"+
		"So soon be drawn, nor did he think it meet\n"+
		"To lay so dangerous and dear a trust\n"+
		"On any soul removed but on his own.\n"+
		"Yet doth he give us bold advertisement,\n"+
		"That with our small conjunction we should on,\n"+
		"To see how fortune is disposed to us;\n"+
		"For, as he writes, there is no quailing now.\n"+
		"Because the king is certainly possess'd\n"+
		"Of all our purposes. What say you to it?\n"+
		"EARL OF WORCESTER\n"+
		"Your father's sickness is a maim to us.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"A perilous gash, a very limb lopp'd off:\n"+
		"And yet, in faith, it is not; his present want\n"+
		"Seems more than we shall find it: were it good\n"+
		"To set the exact wealth of all our states\n"+
		"All at one cast? to set so rich a main\n"+
		"On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour?\n"+
		"It were not good; for therein should we read\n"+
		"The very bottom and the soul of hope,\n"+
		"The very list, the very utmost bound\n"+
		"Of all our fortunes.\n"+
		"EARL OF DOUGLAS\n"+
		"'Faith, and so we should;\n"+
		"Where now remains a sweet reversion:\n"+
		"We may boldly spend upon the hope of what\n"+
		"Is to come in:\n"+
		"A comfort of retirement lives in this.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"A rendezvous, a home to fly unto.\n"+
		"If that the devil and mischance look big\n"+
		"Upon the maidenhead of our affairs.\n"+
		"EARL OF WORCESTER\n"+
		"But yet I would your father had been here.\n"+
		"The quality and hair of our attempt\n"+
		"Brooks no division: it will be thought\n"+
		"By some, that know not why he is away,\n"+
		"That wisdom, loyalty and mere dislike\n"+
		"Of our proceedings kept the earl from hence:\n"+
		"And think how such an apprehension\n"+
		"May turn the tide of fearful faction\n"+
		"And breed a kind of question in our cause;\n"+
		"For well you know we of the offering side\n"+
		"Must keep aloof from strict arbitrement,\n"+
		"And stop all sight-holes, every loop from whence\n"+
		"The eye of reason may pry in upon us:\n"+
		"This absence of your father's draws a curtain,\n"+
		"That shows the ignorant a kind of fear\n"+
		"Before not dreamt of.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"You strain too far.\n"+
		"I rather of his absence make this use:\n"+
		"It lends a lustre and more great opinion,\n"+
		"A larger dare to our great enterprise,\n"+
		"Than if the earl were here; for men must think,\n"+
		"If we without his help can make a head\n"+
		"To push against a kingdom, with his help\n"+
		"We shall o'erturn it topsy-turvy down.\n"+
		"Yet all goes well, yet all our joints are whole.\n"+
		"EARL OF DOUGLAS\n"+
		"As heart can think: there is not such a word\n"+
		"Spoke of in Scotland as this term of fear.\n"+
		"Enter SIR RICHARD VERNON\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"My cousin Vernon, welcome, by my soul.\n"+
		"VERNON\n"+
		"Pray God my news be worth a welcome, lord.\n"+
		"The Earl of Westmoreland, seven thousand strong,\n"+
		"Is marching hitherwards; with him Prince John.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"No harm: what more?\n"+
		"VERNON\n"+
		"And further, I have learn'd,\n"+
		"The king himself in person is set forth,\n"+
		"Or hitherwards intended speedily,\n"+
		"With strong and mighty preparation.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"He shall be welcome too. Where is his son,\n"+
		"The nimble-footed madcap Prince of Wales,\n"+
		"And his comrades, that daff'd the world aside,\n"+
		"And bid it pass?\n"+
		"VERNON\n"+
		"All furnish'd, all in arms;\n"+
		"All plumed like estridges that with the wind\n"+
		"Baited like eagles having lately bathed;\n"+
		"Glittering in golden coats, like images;\n"+
		"As full of spirit as the month of May,\n"+
		"And gorgeous as the sun at midsummer;\n"+
		"Wanton as youthful goats, wild as young bulls.\n"+
		"I saw young Harry, with his beaver on,\n"+
		"His cuisses on his thighs, gallantly arm'd\n"+
		"Rise from the ground like feather'd Mercury,\n"+
		"And vaulted with such ease into his seat,\n"+
		"As if an angel dropp'd down from the clouds,\n"+
		"To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus\n"+
		"And witch the world with noble horsemanship.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"No more, no more: worse than the sun in March,\n"+
		"This praise doth nourish agues. Let them come:\n"+
		"They come like sacrifices in their trim,\n"+
		"And to the fire-eyed maid of smoky war\n"+
		"All hot and bleeding will we offer them:\n"+
		"The mailed Mars shall on his altar sit\n"+
		"Up to the ears in blood. I am on fire\n"+
		"To hear this rich reprisal is so nigh\n"+
		"And yet not ours. Come, let me taste my horse,\n"+
		"Who is to bear me like a thunderbolt\n"+
		"Against the bosom of the Prince of Wales:\n"+
		"Harry to Harry shall, hot horse to horse,\n"+
		"Meet and ne'er part till one drop down a corse.\n"+
		"O that Glendower were come!\n"+
		"VERNON\n"+
		"There is more news:\n"+
		"I learn'd in Worcester, as I rode along,\n"+
		"He cannot draw his power this fourteen days.\n"+
		"EARL OF DOUGLAS\n"+
		"That's the worst tidings that I hear of yet.\n"+
		"WORCESTER\n"+
		"Ay, by my faith, that bears a frosty sound.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"What may the king's whole battle reach unto?\n"+
		"VERNON\n"+
		"To thirty thousand.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"Forty let it be:\n"+
		"My father and Glendower being both away,\n"+
		"The powers of us may serve so great a day\n"+
		"Come, let us take a muster speedily:\n"+

		"EARL OF DOUGLAS\n"+
		"Talk not of dying: I am out of fear\n"+

		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. A public road near Coventry.\n"+
		"Enter FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Bardolph, get thee before to Coventry; fill me a\n"+
		"bottle of sack: our soldiers shall march through;\n"+
		"we'll to Sutton Co'fil' tonight.\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Will you give me money, captain?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Lay out, lay out.\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"This bottle makes an angel.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"An if it do, take it for thy labour; and if it make\n"+
		"twenty, take them all; I'll answer the coinage. Bid\n"+
		"my lieutenant Peto meet me at town's end.\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"I will, captain: farewell.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"If I be not ashamed of my soldiers, I am a soused\n"+
		"gurnet. I have misused the king's press damnably.\n"+
		"I have got, in exchange of a hundred and fifty\n"+
		"soldiers, three hundred and odd pounds. I press me\n"+
		"none but good house-holders, yeoman's sons; inquire\n"+
		"me out contracted bachelors, such as had been asked\n"+
		"twice on the banns; such a commodity of warm slaves,\n"+
		"as had as lieve hear the devil as a drum; such as\n"+
		"fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck\n"+
		"fowl or a hurt wild-duck. I pressed me none but such\n"+
		"toasts-and-butter, with hearts in their bellies no\n"+
		"bigger than pins' heads, and they have bought out\n"+
		"their services; and now my whole charge consists of\n"+
		"ancients, corporals, lieutenants, gentlemen of\n"+
		"companies, slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the\n"+
		"painted cloth, where the glutton's dogs licked his\n"+
		"sores; and such as indeed were never soldiers, but\n"+
		"discarded unjust serving-men, younger sons to\n"+
		"younger brothers, revolted tapsters and ostlers\n"+
		"trade-fallen, the cankers of a calm world and a\n"+
		"long peace, ten times more dishonourable ragged than\n"+
		"an old faced ancient: and such have I, to fill up\n"+
		"the rooms of them that have bought out their\n"+
		"services, that you would think that I had a hundred\n"+
		"and fifty tattered prodigals lately come from\n"+
		"swine-keeping, from eating draff and husks. A mad\n"+
		"fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded\n"+
		"all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies. No eye\n"+
		"hath seen such scarecrows. I'll not march through\n"+
		"Coventry with them, that's flat: nay, and the\n"+
		"villains march wide betwixt the legs, as if they had\n"+
		"gyves on; for indeed I had the most of them out of\n"+
		"prison. There's but a shirt and a half in all my\n"+
		"company; and the half shirt is two napkins tacked\n"+
		"together and thrown over the shoulders like an\n"+
		"herald's coat without sleeves; and the shirt, to say\n"+
		"the truth, stolen from my host at Saint Alban's, or\n"+
		"the red-nose innkeeper of Daventry. But that's all\n"+
		"one; they'll find linen enough on every hedge.\n"+
		"Enter the PRINCE and WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"How now, blown Jack! how now, quilt!\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"What, Hal! how now, mad wag! what a devil dost thou\n"+
		"in Warwickshire? My good Lord of Westmoreland, I\n"+
		"cry you mercy: I thought your honour had already been\n"+
		"at Shrewsbury.\n"+
		"WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"Faith, Sir John,'tis more than time that I were\n"+
		"there, and you too; but my powers are there already.\n"+
		"The king, I can tell you, looks for us all: we must\n"+
		"away all night.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Tut, never fear me: I am as vigilant as a cat to\n"+
		"steal cream.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"I think, to steal cream indeed, for thy theft hath\n"+
		"already made thee butter. But tell me, Jack, whose\n"+
		"fellows are these that come after?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Mine, Hal, mine.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"I did never see such pitiful rascals.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Tut, tut; good enough to toss; food for powder, food\n"+
		"for powder; they'll fill a pit as well as better:\n"+
		"tush, man, mortal men, mortal men.\n"+
		"WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"Ay, but, Sir John, methinks they are exceeding poor\n"+
		"and bare, too beggarly.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"'Faith, for their poverty, I know not where they had\n"+
		"that; and for their bareness, I am sure they never\n"+
		"learned that of me.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"No I'll be sworn; unless you call three fingers on\n"+
		"the ribs bare. But, sirrah, make haste: Percy is\n"+
		"already in the field.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"What, is the king encamped?\n"+
		"WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"He is, Sir John: I fear we shall stay too long.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Well,\n"+
		"To the latter end of a fray and the beginning of a feast\n"+
		"Fits a dull fighter and a keen guest.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+

		"And I dare well maintain it with my life,\n"+
		"If well-respected honour bid me on,\n"+
		"I hold as little counsel with weak fear\n"+

		"To-night, say I.\n"+
		"VERNON\n"+
		"Come, come it nay not be. I wonder much,\n"+
		"Being men of such great leading as you are,\n"+
		"That you foresee not what impediments\n"+
		"Drag back our expedition: certain horse\n"+
		"Of my cousin Vernon's are not yet come up:\n"+
		"Your uncle Worcester's horse came but today;\n"+
		"And now their pride and mettle is asleep,\n"+
		"Their courage with hard labour tame and dull,\n"+
		"That not a horse is half the half of himself.\n"+

		"SIR WALTER BLUNT\n"+
		"I come with gracious offers from the king,\n"+
		"if you vouchsafe me hearing and respect.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"Welcome, Sir Walter Blunt; and would to God\n"+
		"You were of our determination!\n"+
		"Some of us love you well; and even those some\n"+
		"Envy your great deservings and good name,\n"+
		"Because you are not of our quality,\n"+
		"But stand against us like an enemy.\n"+
		"SIR WALTER BLUNT\n"+
		"And God defend but still I should stand so,\n"+
		"So long as out of limit and true rule\n"+
		"You stand against anointed majesty.\n"+
		"But to my charge. The king hath sent to know\n"+
		"The nature of your griefs, and whereupon\n"+
		"You conjure from the breast of civil peace\n"+
		"Such bold hostility, teaching his duteous land\n"+
		"Audacious cruelty. If that the king\n"+
		"Have any way your good deserts forgot,\n"+
		"Which he confesseth to be manifold,\n"+
		"He bids you name your griefs; and with all speed\n"+
		"You shall have your desires with interest\n"+
		"And pardon absolute for yourself and these\n"+
		"Herein misled by your suggestion.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"The king is kind; and well we know the king\n"+
		"Knows at what time to promise, when to pay.\n"+
		"My father and my uncle and myself\n"+
		"Did give him that same royalty he wears;\n"+
		"And when he was not six and twenty strong,\n"+
		"Sick in the world's regard, wretched and low,\n"+
		"A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,\n"+
		"My father gave him welcome to the shore;\n"+
		"And when he heard him swear and vow to God\n"+
		"He came but to be Duke of Lancaster,\n"+
		"To sue his livery and beg his peace,\n"+
		"With tears of innocency and terms of zeal,\n"+
		"My father, in kind heart and pity moved,\n"+
		"Swore him assistance and perform'd it too.\n"+
		"Now when the lords and barons of the realm\n"+
		"Perceived Northumberland did lean to him,\n"+
		"The more and less came in with cap and knee;\n"+
		"Met him in boroughs, cities, villages,\n"+
		"Attended him on bridges, stood in lanes,\n"+
		"Laid gifts before him, proffer'd him their oaths,\n"+
		"Gave him their heirs, as pages follow'd him\n"+
		"Even at the heels in golden multitudes.\n"+
		"He presently, as greatness knows itself,\n"+
		"Steps me a little higher than his vow\n"+
		"Made to my father, while his blood was poor,\n"+
		"Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh;\n"+
		"And now, forsooth, takes on him to reform\n"+
		"Some certain edicts and some strait decrees\n"+
		"That lie too heavy on the commonwealth,\n"+
		"Cries out upon abuses, seems to weep\n"+
		"Over his country's wrongs; and by this face,\n"+
		"This seeming brow of justice, did he win\n"+
		"The hearts of all that he did angle for;\n"+
		"Proceeded further; cut me off the heads\n"+
		"Of all the favourites that the absent king\n"+
		"In deputation left behind him here,\n"+
		"When he was personal in the Irish war.\n"+
		"SIR WALTER BLUNT\n"+
		"Tut, I came not to hear this.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"Then to the point.\n"+
		"In short time after, he deposed the king;\n"+
		"Soon after that, deprived him of his life;\n"+
		"And in the neck of that, task'd the whole state:\n"+
		"To make that worse, suffer'd his kinsman March,\n"+
		"Who is, if every owner were well placed,\n"+
		"Indeed his king, to be engaged in Wales,\n"+
		"There without ransom to lie forfeited;\n"+
		"Disgraced me in my happy victories,\n"+
		"Sought to entrap me by intelligence;\n"+
		"Rated mine uncle from the council-board;\n"+
		"In rage dismiss'd my father from the court;\n"+
		"Broke oath on oath, committed wrong on wrong,\n"+
		"And in conclusion drove us to seek out\n"+
		"This head of safety; and withal to pry\n"+
		"Into his title, the which we find\n"+
		"Too indirect for long continuance.\n"+
		"SIR WALTER BLUNT\n"+
		"Shall I return this answer to the king?\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"Not so, Sir Walter: we'll withdraw awhile.\n"+
		"Go to the king; and let there be impawn'd\n"+
		"Some surety for a safe return again,\n"+
		"And in the morning early shall my uncle\n"+
		"Bring him our purposes: and so farewell.\n"+
		"SIR WALTER BLUNT\n"+
		"I would you would accept of grace and love.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"And may be so we shall.\n"+
		"SIR WALTER BLUNT\n"+
		"Pray God you do.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV. York. The ARCHBISHOP'S palace.\n"+
		"Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK and SIR MICHAEL\n"+
		"ARCHBISHOP OF YORK\n"+
		"Hie, good Sir Michael; bear this sealed brief\n"+
		"With winged haste to the lord marshal;\n"+
		"This to my cousin Scroop, and all the rest\n"+
		"To whom they are directed. If you knew\n"+
		"How much they do to import, you would make haste.\n"+
		"SIR MICHAEL\n"+
		"My good lord,\n"+
		"I guess their tenor.\n"+
		"ARCHBISHOP OF YORK\n"+
		"Like enough you do.\n"+
		"To-morrow, good Sir Michael, is a day\n"+
		"Wherein the fortune of ten thousand men\n"+
		"Must bide the touch; for, sir, at Shrewsbury,\n"+
		"As I am truly given to understand,\n"+
		"The king with mighty and quick-raised power\n"+
		"Meets with Lord Harry: and, I fear, Sir Michael,\n"+
		"What with the sickness of Northumberland,\n"+
		"Whose power was in the first proportion,\n"+
		"And what with Owen Glendower's absence thence,\n"+
		"Who with them was a rated sinew too\n"+
		"And comes not in, o'er-ruled by prophecies,\n"+
		"I fear the power of Percy is too weak\n"+
		"To wage an instant trial with the king.\n"+
		"SIR MICHAEL\n"+
		"Why, my good lord, you need not fear;\n"+
		"There is Douglas and Lord Mortimer.\n"+
		"ARCHBISHOP OF YORK\n"+
		"No, Mortimer is not there.\n"+
		"SIR MICHAEL\n"+
		"But there is Mordake, Vernon, Lord Harry Percy,\n"+
		"And there is my Lord of Worcester and a head\n"+
		"Of gallant warriors, noble gentlemen.\n"+
		"ARCHBISHOP OF YORK\n"+
		"And so there is: but yet the king hath drawn\n"+
		"The special head of all the land together:\n"+
		"The Prince of Wales, Lord John of Lancaster,\n"+
		"The noble Westmoreland and warlike Blunt;\n"+
		"And moe corrivals and dear men\n"+
		"Of estimation and command in arms.\n"+
		"SIR MICHAEL\n"+
		"Doubt not, my lord, they shall be well opposed.\n"+
		"ARCHBISHOP OF YORK\n"+
		"I hope no less, yet needful 'tis to fear;\n"+
		"And, to prevent the worst, Sir Michael, speed:\n"+
		"For if Lord Percy thrive not, ere the king\n"+
		"Dismiss his power, he means to visit us,\n"+
		"For he hath heard of our confederacy,\n"+
		"And 'tis but wisdom to make strong against him:\n"+
		"Therefore make haste. I must go write again\n"+
		"To other friends; and so farewell, Sir Michael.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT V\n"+
		"SCENE I. KING HENRY IV's camp near Shrewsbury.\n"+
		"Enter KING HENRY, PRINCE HENRY, Lord John of LANCASTER, EARL OF WESTMORELAND, SIR WALTER BLUNT, and FALSTAFF\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"How bloodily the sun begins to peer\n"+
		"Above yon busky hill! the day looks pale\n"+
		"At his distemperature.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"The southern wind\n"+
		"Doth play the trumpet to his purposes,\n"+
		"And by his hollow whistling in the leaves\n"+
		"Foretells a tempest and a blustering day.\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"Then with the losers let it sympathize,\n"+
		"For nothing can seem foul to those that win.\n"+
		"The trumpet sounds\n"+
		"Enter WORCESTER and VERNON\n"+
		"How now, my Lord of Worcester! 'tis not well\n"+
		"That you and I should meet upon such terms\n"+
		"As now we meet. You have deceived our trust,\n"+
		"And made us doff our easy robes of peace,\n"+
		"To crush our old limbs in ungentle steel:\n"+
		"This is not well, my lord, this is not well.\n"+
		"What say you to it? will you again unknit\n"+
		"This curlish knot of all-abhorred war?\n"+
		"And move in that obedient orb again\n"+
		"Where you did give a fair and natural light,\n"+
		"And be no more an exhaled meteor,\n"+
		"A prodigy of fear and a portent\n"+
		"Of broached mischief to the unborn times?\n"+
		"EARL OF WORCESTER\n"+
		"Hear me, my liege:\n"+
		"For mine own part, I could be well content\n"+
		"To entertain the lag-end of my life\n"+
		"With quiet hours; for I do protest,\n"+
		"I have not sought the day of this dislike.\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"You have not sought it! how comes it, then?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Rebellion lay in his way, and he found it.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Peace, chewet, peace!\n"+
		"EARL OF WORCESTER\n"+
		"It pleased your majesty to turn your looks\n"+
		"Of favour from myself and all our house;\n"+
		"And yet I must remember you, my lord,\n"+
		"We were the first and dearest of your friends.\n"+
		"For you my staff of office did I break\n"+
		"In Richard's time; and posted day and night\n"+
		"to meet you on the way, and kiss your hand,\n"+
		"When yet you were in place and in account\n"+
		"Nothing so strong and fortunate as I.\n"+
		"It was myself, my brother and his son,\n"+
		"That brought you home and boldly did outdare\n"+
		"The dangers of the time. You swore to us,\n"+
		"And you did swear that oath at Doncaster,\n"+
		"That you did nothing purpose 'gainst the state;\n"+
		"Nor claim no further than your new-fall'n right,\n"+
		"The seat of Gaunt, dukedom of Lancaster:\n"+
		"To this we swore our aid. But in short space\n"+
		"It rain'd down fortune showering on your head;\n"+
		"And such a flood of greatness fell on you,\n"+
		"What with our help, what with the absent king,\n"+
		"What with the injuries of a wanton time,\n"+
		"The seeming sufferances that you had borne,\n"+
		"And the contrarious winds that held the king\n"+
		"So long in his unlucky Irish wars\n"+
		"That all in England did repute him dead:\n"+
		"And from this swarm of fair advantages\n"+
		"You took occasion to be quickly woo'd\n"+
		"To gripe the general sway into your hand;\n"+
		"Forget your oath to us at Doncaster;\n"+
		"And being fed by us you used us so\n"+
		"As that ungentle hull, the cuckoo's bird,\n"+
		"Useth the sparrow; did oppress our nest;\n"+
		"Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk\n"+
		"That even our love durst not come near your sight\n"+
		"For fear of swallowing; but with nimble wing\n"+
		"We were enforced, for safety sake, to fly\n"+
		"Out of sight and raise this present head;\n"+
		"Whereby we stand opposed by such means\n"+
		"As you yourself have forged against yourself\n"+
		"By unkind usage, dangerous countenance,\n"+
		"And violation of all faith and troth\n"+
		"Sworn to us in your younger enterprise.\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"These things indeed you have articulate,\n"+
		"Proclaim'd at market-crosses, read in churches,\n"+
		"To face the garment of rebellion\n"+
		"With some fine colour that may please the eye\n"+
		"Of fickle changelings and poor discontents,\n"+
		"Which gape and rub the elbow at the news\n"+
		"Of hurlyburly innovation:\n"+
		"And never yet did insurrection want\n"+
		"Such water-colours to impaint his cause;\n"+
		"Nor moody beggars, starving for a time\n"+
		"Of pellmell havoc and confusion.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"In both your armies there is many a soul\n"+
		"Shall pay full dearly for this encounter,\n"+
		"If once they join in trial. Tell your nephew,\n"+
		"The Prince of Wales doth join with all the world\n"+
		"In praise of Henry Percy: by my hopes,\n"+
		"This present enterprise set off his head,\n"+
		"I do not think a braver gentleman,\n"+
		"More active-valiant or more valiant-young,\n"+
		"More daring or more bold, is now alive\n"+
		"To grace this latter age with noble deeds.\n"+
		"For my part, I may speak it to my shame,\n"+
		"I have a truant been to chivalry;\n"+
		"And so I hear he doth account me too;\n"+
		"Yet this before my father's majesty--\n"+
		"I am content that he shall take the odds\n"+
		"Of his great name and estimation,\n"+
		"And will, to save the blood on either side,\n"+
		"Try fortune with him in a single fight.\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"And, Prince of Wales, so dare we venture thee,\n"+
		"Albeit considerations infinite\n"+
		"Do make against it. No, good Worcester, no,\n"+
		"We love our people well; even those we love\n"+
		"That are misled upon your cousin's part;\n"+
		"And, will they take the offer of our grace,\n"+
		"Both he and they and you, every man\n"+
		"Shall be my friend again and I'll be his:\n"+
		"So tell your cousin, and bring me word\n"+
		"What he will do: but if he will not yield,\n"+
		"Rebuke and dread correction wait on us\n"+
		"And they shall do their office. So, be gone;\n"+
		"We will not now be troubled with reply:\n"+
		"We offer fair; take it advisedly.\n"+
		"Exeunt WORCESTER and VERNON\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"It will not be accepted, on my life:\n"+
		"The Douglas and the Hotspur both together\n"+
		"Are confident against the world in arms.\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"Hence, therefore, every leader to his charge;\n"+
		"For, on their answer, will we set on them:\n"+
		"And God befriend us, as our cause is just!\n"+
		"Exeunt all but PRINCE HENRY and FALSTAFF\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Hal, if thou see me down in the battle and bestride\n"+
		"me, so; 'tis a point of friendship.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Nothing but a colossus can do thee that friendship.\n"+
		"Say thy prayers, and farewell.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"I would 'twere bed-time, Hal, and all well.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Why, thou owest God a death.\n"+
		"Exit PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"'Tis not due yet; I would be loath to pay him before\n"+
		"his day. What need I be so forward with him that\n"+
		"calls not on me? Well, 'tis no matter; honour pricks\n"+
		"me on. Yea, but how if honour prick me off when I\n"+
		"come on? how then? Can honour set to a leg? no: or\n"+
		"an arm? no: or take away the grief of a wound? no.\n"+
		"Honour hath no skill in surgery, then? no. What is\n"+
		"honour? a word. What is in that word honour? what\n"+
		"is that honour? air. A trim reckoning! Who hath it?\n"+
		"he that died o' Wednesday. Doth he feel it? no.\n"+
		"Doth he hear it? no. 'Tis insensible, then. Yea,\n"+
		"to the dead. But will it not live with the living?\n"+
		"no. Why? detraction will not suffer it. Therefore\n"+
		"I'll none of it. Honour is a mere scutcheon: and so\n"+
		"ends my catechism.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE II. The rebel camp.\n"+
		"Enter WORCESTER and VERNON\n"+
		"EARL OF WORCESTER\n"+
		"O, no, my nephew must not know, Sir Richard,\n"+
		"The liberal and kind offer of the king.\n"+
		"VERNON\n"+
		"'Twere best he did.\n"+
		"EARL OF WORCESTER\n"+
		"Then are we all undone.\n"+
		"It is not possible, it cannot be,\n"+
		"The king should keep his word in loving us;\n"+
		"He will suspect us still and find a time\n"+
		"To punish this offence in other faults:\n"+
		"Suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes;\n"+
		"For treason is but trusted like the fox,\n"+
		"Who, ne'er so tame, so cherish'd and lock'd up,\n"+
		"Will have a wild trick of his ancestors.\n"+
		"Look how we can, or sad or merrily,\n"+
		"Interpretation will misquote our looks,\n"+
		"And we shall feed like oxen at a stall,\n"+
		"The better cherish'd, still the nearer death.\n"+
		"My nephew's trespass may be well forgot;\n"+
		"it hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood,\n"+
		"And an adopted name of privilege,\n"+
		"A hair-brain'd Hotspur, govern'd by a spleen:\n"+
		"All his offences live upon my head\n"+
		"And on his father's; we did train him on,\n"+
		"And, his corruption being ta'en from us,\n"+
		"We, as the spring of all, shall pay for all.\n"+
		"Therefore, good cousin, let not Harry know,\n"+
		"In any case, the offer of the king.\n"+

		"Marry, and shall, and very willingly.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"EARL OF WORCESTER\n"+
		"There is no seeming mercy in the king.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"Did you beg any? God forbid!\n"+
		"EARL OF WORCESTER\n"+
		"I told him gently of our grievances,\n"+
		"Of his oath-breaking; which he mended thus,\n"+
		"By now forswearing that he is forsworn:\n"+

		"With haughty arms this hateful name in us.\n"+
		"Re-enter the EARL OF DOUGLAS\n"+
		"EARL OF DOUGLAS\n"+
		"Arm, gentlemen; to arms! for I have thrown\n"+
		"A brave defiance in King Henry's teeth,\n"+

		"EARL OF WORCESTER\n"+
		"The Prince of Wales stepp'd forth before the king,\n"+
		"And, nephew, challenged you to single fight.\n"+

		"O, would the quarrel lay upon our heads,\n"+
		"And that no man might draw short breath today\n"+
		"But I and Harry Monmouth! Tell me, tell me,\n"+
		"How show'd his tasking? seem'd it in contempt?\n"+
		"VERNON\n"+
		"No, by my soul; I never in my life\n"+
		"Did hear a challenge urged more modestly,\n"+
		"Unless a brother should a brother dare\n"+
		"To gentle exercise and proof of arms.\n"+
		"He gave you all the duties of a man;\n"+
		"Trimm'd up your praises with a princely tongue,\n"+
		"Spoke to your deservings like a chronicle,\n"+
		"Making you ever better than his praise\n"+
		"By still dispraising praise valued in you;\n"+
		"And, which became him like a prince indeed,\n"+
		"He made a blushing cital of himself;\n"+
		"And chid his truant youth with such a grace\n"+
		"As if he master'd there a double spirit.\n"+
		"Of teaching and of learning instantly.\n"+
		"There did he pause: but let me tell the world,\n"+
		"If he outlive the envy of this day,\n"+
		"England did never owe so sweet a hope,\n"+
		"So much misconstrued in his wantonness.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"Cousin, I think thou art enamoured\n"+
		"On his follies: never did I hear\n"+
		"Of any prince so wild a libertine.\n"+
		"But be he as he will, yet once ere night\n"+
		"I will embrace him with a soldier's arm,\n"+
		"That he shall shrink under my courtesy.\n"+
		"Arm, arm with speed: and, fellows, soldiers, friends,\n"+
		"Better consider what you have to do\n"+
		"Than I, that have not well the gift of tongue,\n"+
		"Can lift your blood up with persuasion.\n"+
		"Enter a Messenger\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"My lord, here are letters for you.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"I cannot read them now.\n"+
		"O gentlemen, the time of life is short!\n"+
		"To spend that shortness basely were too long,\n"+
		"If life did ride upon a dial's point,\n"+
		"Still ending at the arrival of an hour.\n"+
		"An if we live, we live to tread on kings;\n"+
		"If die, brave death, when princes die with us!\n"+
		"Now, for our consciences, the arms are fair,\n"+
		"When the intent of bearing them is just.\n"+
		"Enter another Messenger\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"My lord, prepare; the king comes on apace.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"I thank him, that he cuts me from my tale,\n"+
		"For I profess not talking; only this--\n"+
		"Let each man do his best: and here draw I\n"+
		"A sword, whose temper I intend to stain\n"+
		"With the best blood that I can meet withal\n"+
		"In the adventure of this perilous day.\n"+
		"Now, Esperance! Percy! and set on.\n"+
		"Sound all the lofty instruments of war,\n"+
		"And by that music let us all embrace;\n"+
		"For, heaven to earth, some of us never shall\n"+

		"I was not born a yielder, thou proud Scot;\n"+

		"the shot here; here's no scoring but upon the pate.\n"+
		"Soft! who are you? Sir Walter Blunt: there's honour\n"+
		"for you! here's no vanity! I am as hot as moulten\n"+
		"lead, and as heavy too: God keep lead out of me! I\n"+
		"need no more weight than mine own bowels. I have\n"+
		"led my ragamuffins where they are peppered: there's\n"+
		"not three of my hundred and fifty left alive; and\n"+
		"they are for the town's end, to beg during life.\n"+

		"What, stand'st thou idle here? lend me thy sword:\n"+

		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"O Hal, I prithee, give me leave to breathe awhile.\n"+
		"Turk Gregory never did such deeds in arms as I have\n"+

		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Give it to me: what, is it in the case?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Ay, Hal; 'tis hot, 'tis hot; there's that will sack a city.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY draws it out, and finds it to be a bottle of sack\n"+

		"What, is it a time to jest and dally now?\n"+
		"He throws the bottle at him. Exit\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Well, if Percy be alive, I'll pierce him. If he do\n"+
		"come in my way, so: if he do not, if I come in his\n"+
		"willingly, let him make a carbonado of me. I like\n"+

		"But, seeing thou fall'st on me so luckily,\n"+
		"I will assay thee: so, defend thyself.\n"+
		"EARL OF DOUGLAS\n"+
		"I fear thou art another counterfeit;\n"+
		"And yet, in faith, thou bear'st thee like a king:\n"+
		"But mine I am sure thou art, whoe'er thou be,\n"+
		"And thus I win thee.\n"+
		"They fight. KING HENRY being in danger, PRINCE HENRY enters\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Hold up thy head, vile Scot, or thou art like\n"+
		"Never to hold it up again! the spirits\n"+
		"Of valiant Shirley, Stafford, Blunt, are in my arms:\n"+
		"It is the Prince of Wales that threatens thee;\n"+
		"Who never promiseth but he means to pay.\n"+
		"They fight: DOUGLAS flies\n"+
		"Cheerly, my lord how fares your grace?\n"+
		"Sir Nicholas Gawsey hath for succor sent,\n"+
		"And so hath Clifton: I'll to Clifton straight.\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"Stay, and breathe awhile:\n"+
		"Thou hast redeem'd thy lost opinion,\n"+
		"And show'd thou makest some tender of my life,\n"+
		"In this fair rescue thou hast brought to me.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"O God! they did me too much injury\n"+
		"That ever said I hearken'd for your death.\n"+
		"If it were so, I might have let alone\n"+
		"The insulting hand of Douglas over you,\n"+
		"Which would have been as speedy in your end\n"+
		"As all the poisonous potions in the world\n"+
		"And saved the treacherous labour of your son.\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"Make up to Clifton: I'll to Sir Nicholas Gawsey.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"Enter HOTSPUR\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"If I mistake not, thou art Harry Monmouth.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Thou speak'st as if I would deny my name.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"My name is Harry Percy.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Why, then I see\n"+
		"A very valiant rebel of the name.\n"+
		"I am the Prince of Wales; and think not, Percy,\n"+
		"To share with me in glory any more:\n"+
		"Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere;\n"+
		"Nor can one England brook a double reign,\n"+
		"Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"Nor shall it, Harry; for the hour is come\n"+
		"To end the one of us; and would to God\n"+
		"Thy name in arms were now as great as mine!\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"I'll make it greater ere I part from thee;\n"+
		"And all the budding honours on thy crest\n"+
		"I'll crop, to make a garland for my head.\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"I can no longer brook thy vanities.\n"+
		"They fight\n"+
		"Enter FALSTAFF\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Well said, Hal! to it Hal! Nay, you shall find no\n"+
		"boy's play here, I can tell you.\n"+
		"Re-enter DOUGLAS; he fights with FALSTAFF, who falls down as if he were dead, and exit DOUGLAS. HOTSPUR is wounded, and falls\n"+
		"HOTSPUR\n"+
		"O, Harry, thou hast robb'd me of my youth!\n"+
		"I better brook the loss of brittle life\n"+
		"Than those proud titles thou hast won of me;\n"+
		"They wound my thoughts worse than sword my flesh:\n"+
		"But thought's the slave of life, and life time's fool;\n"+
		"And time, that takes survey of all the world,\n"+
		"Must have a stop. O, I could prophesy,\n"+
		"But that the earthy and cold hand of death\n"+
		"Lies on my tongue: no, Percy, thou art dust\n"+
		"And food for--\n"+
		"Dies\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"For worms, brave Percy: fare thee well, great heart!\n"+
		"Ill-weaved ambition, how much art thou shrunk!\n"+
		"When that this body did contain a spirit,\n"+
		"A kingdom for it was too small a bound;\n"+
		"But now two paces of the vilest earth\n"+
		"Is room enough: this earth that bears thee dead\n"+
		"Bears not alive so stout a gentleman.\n"+
		"If thou wert sensible of courtesy,\n"+
		"I should not make so dear a show of zeal:\n"+
		"But let my favours hide thy mangled face;\n"+
		"And, even in thy behalf, I'll thank myself\n"+
		"For doing these fair rites of tenderness.\n"+
		"Adieu, and take thy praise with thee to heaven!\n"+
		"Thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave,\n"+
		"But not remember'd in thy epitaph!\n"+
		"He spieth FALSTAFF on the ground\n"+
		"What, old acquaintance! could not all this flesh\n"+
		"Keep in a little life? Poor Jack, farewell!\n"+
		"I could have better spared a better man:\n"+
		"O, I should have a heavy miss of thee,\n"+
		"If I were much in love with vanity!\n"+
		"Death hath not struck so fat a deer to-day,\n"+
		"Though many dearer, in this bloody fray.\n"+
		"Embowell'd will I see thee by and by:\n"+
		"Till then in blood by noble Percy lie.\n"+
		"Exit PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"[Rising up] Embowelled! if thou embowel me to-day,\n"+
		"I'll give you leave to powder me and eat me too\n"+
		"to-morrow. 'Sblood,'twas time to counterfeit, or\n"+
		"that hot termagant Scot had paid me scot and lot too.\n"+
		"Counterfeit? I lie, I am no counterfeit: to die,\n"+
		"is to be a counterfeit; for he is but the\n"+
		"counterfeit of a man who hath not the life of a man:\n"+
		"but to counterfeit dying, when a man thereby\n"+
		"liveth, is to be no counterfeit, but the true and\n"+
		"perfect image of life indeed. The better part of\n"+
		"valour is discretion; in the which better part I\n"+
		"have saved my life.'Zounds, I am afraid of this\n"+
		"gunpowder Percy, though he be dead: how, if he\n"+
		"should counterfeit too and rise? by my faith, I am\n"+
		"afraid he would prove the better counterfeit.\n"+
		"Therefore I'll make him sure; yea, and I'll swear I\n"+
		"killed him. Why may not he rise as well as I?\n"+
		"Nothing confutes me but eyes, and nobody sees me.\n"+
		"Therefore, sirrah,\n"+
		"Stabbing him\n"+
		"with a new wound in your thigh, come you along with me.\n"+
		"Takes up HOTSPUR on his back\n"+
		"Re-enter PRINCE HENRY and LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Come, brother John; full bravely hast thou flesh'd\n"+
		"Thy maiden sword.\n"+
		"LANCASTER\n"+
		"But, soft! whom have we here?\n"+
		"Did you not tell me this fat man was dead?\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"I did; I saw him dead,\n"+
		"Breathless and bleeding on the ground. Art\n"+
		"thou alive?\n"+
		"Or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight?\n"+
		"I prithee, speak; we will not trust our eyes\n"+
		"Without our ears: thou art not what thou seem'st.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"No, that's certain; I am not a double man: but if I\n"+
		"be not Jack Falstaff, then am I a Jack. There is Percy:\n"+
		"Throwing the body down\n"+
		"if your father will do me any honour, so; if not, let\n"+
		"him kill the next Percy himself. I look to be either\n"+
		"earl or duke, I can assure you.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Why, Percy I killed myself and saw thee dead.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Didst thou? Lord, Lord, how this world is given to\n"+
		"lying! I grant you I was down and out of breath;\n"+
		"and so was he: but we rose both at an instant and\n"+
		"fought a long hour by Shrewsbury clock. If I may be\n"+
		"believed, so; if not, let them that should reward\n"+
		"valour bear the sin upon their own heads. I'll take\n"+
		"it upon my death, I gave him this wound in the\n"+
		"thigh: if the man were alive and would deny it,\n"+
		"'zounds, I would make him eat a piece of my sword.\n"+
		"LANCASTER\n"+
		"This is the strangest tale that ever I heard.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"This is the strangest fellow, brother John.\n"+
		"Come, bring your luggage nobly on your back:\n"+
		"For my part, if a lie may do thee grace,\n"+
		"I'll gild it with the happiest terms I have.\n"+
		"A retreat is sounded\n"+
		"The trumpet sounds retreat; the day is ours.\n"+
		"Come, brother, let us to the highest of the field,\n"+
		"To see what friends are living, who are dead.\n"+
		"Exeunt PRINCE HENRY and LANCASTER\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"I'll follow, as they say, for reward. He that\n"+
		"rewards me, God reward him! If I do grow great,\n"+
		"I'll grow less; for I'll purge, and leave sack, and\n"+
		"live cleanly as a nobleman should do.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE V. Another part of the field.\n"+
		"The trumpets sound. Enter KING HENRY IV, PRINCE HENRY, LORD JOHN LANCASTER, EARL OF WESTMORELAND, with WORCESTER and VERNON prisoners\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.\n"+
		"Ill-spirited Worcester! did not we send grace,\n"+
		"Pardon and terms of love to all of you?\n"+
		"And wouldst thou turn our offers contrary?\n"+
		"Misuse the tenor of thy kinsman's trust?\n"+
		"Three knights upon our party slain to-day,\n"+
		"A noble earl and many a creature else\n"+
		"Had been alive this hour,\n"+
		"If like a Christian thou hadst truly borne\n"+
		"Betwixt our armies true intelligence.\n"+
		"EARL OF WORCESTER\n"+
		"What I have done my safety urged me to;\n"+
		"And I embrace this fortune patiently,\n"+
		"Since not to be avoided it falls on me.\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"Bear Worcester to the death and Vernon too:\n"+
		"Other offenders we will pause upon.\n"+
		"Exeunt WORCESTER and VERNON, guarded\n"+
		"How goes the field?\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"The noble Scot, Lord Douglas, when he saw\n"+
		"The fortune of the day quite turn'd from him,\n"+
		"The noble Percy slain, and all his men\n"+
		"Upon the foot of fear, fled with the rest;\n"+
		"And falling from a hill, he was so bruised\n"+
		"That the pursuers took him. At my tent\n"+
		"The Douglas is; and I beseech your grace\n"+
		"I may dispose of him.\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"With all my heart.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Then, brother John of Lancaster, to you\n"+
		"This honourable bounty shall belong:\n"+
		"Go to the Douglas, and deliver him\n"+
		"Up to his pleasure, ransomless and free:\n"+
		"His valour shown upon our crests to-day\n"+
		"Hath taught us how to cherish such high deeds\n"+
		"Even in the bosom of our adversaries.\n"+
		"LANCASTER\n"+
		"I thank your grace for this high courtesy,\n"+
		"Which I shall give away immediately.\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"Then this remains, that we divide our power.\n"+
		"You, son John, and my cousin Westmoreland\n"+
		"Towards York shall bend you with your dearest speed,\n"+
		"To meet Northumberland and the prelate Scroop,\n"+
		"Who, as we hear, are busily in arms:\n"+
		"Myself and you, son Harry, will towards Wales,\n"+
		"To fight with Glendower and the Earl of March.\n"+
		"Rebellion in this land shall lose his sway,\n"+
		"Meeting the cheque of such another day:\n"+
		"And since this business so fair is done,\n"+
		"Let us not leave till all our own be won.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"The Second part of King Henry the Fourth\n"+
		"None\n"+
		"Warkworth. Before the castle\n"+
		"Enter RUMOUR, painted full of tongues\n"+
		"RUMOUR\n"+
		"Open your ears; for which of you will stop\n"+
		"The vent of hearing when loud Rumour speaks?\n"+
		"I, from the orient to the drooping west,\n"+
		"Making the wind my post-horse, still unfold\n"+
		"The acts commenced on this ball of earth:\n"+
		"Upon my tongues continual slanders ride,\n"+
		"The which in every language I pronounce,\n"+
		"Stuffing the ears of men with false reports.\n"+
		"I speak of peace, while covert enmity\n"+
		"Under the smile of safety wounds the world:\n"+
		"And who but Rumour, who but only I,\n"+
		"Make fearful musters and prepared defence,\n"+
		"Whiles the big year, swoln with some other grief,\n"+
		"Is thought with child by the stern tyrant war,\n"+
		"And no such matter? Rumour is a pipe\n"+
		"Blown by surmises, jealousies, conjectures\n"+
		"And of so easy and so plain a stop\n"+
		"That the blunt monster with uncounted heads,\n"+
		"The still-discordant wavering multitude,\n"+
		"Can play upon it. But what need I thus\n"+
		"My well-known body to anatomize\n"+
		"Among my household? Why is Rumour here?\n"+
		"I run before King Harry's victory;\n"+
		"Who in a bloody field by Shrewsbury\n"+
		"Hath beaten down young Hotspur and his troops,\n"+
		"Quenching the flame of bold rebellion\n"+
		"Even with the rebel's blood. But what mean I\n"+
		"To speak so true at first? my office is\n"+
		"To noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fell\n"+
		"Under the wrath of noble Hotspur's sword,\n"+
		"And that the king before the Douglas' rage\n"+
		"Stoop'd his anointed head as low as death.\n"+
		"This have I rumour'd through the peasant towns\n"+
		"Between that royal field of Shrewsbury\n"+
		"And this worm-eaten hold of ragged stone,\n"+
		"Where Hotspur's father, old Northumberland,\n"+
		"Lies crafty-sick: the posts come tiring on,\n"+
		"And not a man of them brings other news\n"+
		"Than they have learn'd of me: from Rumour's tongues\n"+
		"They bring smooth comforts false, worse than\n"+
		"true wrongs.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"ACT I\n"+
		"SCENE I. The same.\n"+
		"Enter LORD BARDOLPH\n"+
		"LORD BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Who keeps the gate here, ho?\n"+
		"The Porter opens the gate\n"+
		"Where is the earl?\n"+
		"Porter\n"+
		"What shall I say you are?\n"+
		"LORD BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Tell thou the earl\n"+
		"That the Lord Bardolph doth attend him here.\n"+
		"Porter\n"+
		"His lordship is walk'd forth into the orchard;\n"+
		"Please it your honour, knock but at the gate,\n"+
		"And he himself wilt answer.\n"+
		"Enter NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"LORD BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Here comes the earl.\n"+
		"Exit Porter\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"What news, Lord Bardolph? every minute now\n"+
		"Should be the father of some stratagem:\n"+
		"The times are wild: contention, like a horse\n"+
		"Full of high feeding, madly hath broke loose\n"+
		"And bears down all before him.\n"+
		"LORD BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Noble earl,\n"+
		"I bring you certain news from Shrewsbury.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"Good, an God will!\n"+
		"LORD BARDOLPH\n"+
		"As good as heart can wish:\n"+
		"The king is almost wounded to the death;\n"+
		"And, in the fortune of my lord your son,\n"+
		"Prince Harry slain outright; and both the Blunts\n"+
		"Kill'd by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John\n"+
		"And Westmoreland and Stafford fled the field;\n"+
		"And Harry Monmouth's brawn, the hulk Sir John,\n"+
		"Is prisoner to your son: O, such a day,\n"+
		"So fought, so follow'd and so fairly won,\n"+
		"Came not till now to dignify the times,\n"+
		"Since Caesar's fortunes!\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"How is this derived?\n"+
		"Saw you the field? came you from Shrewsbury?\n"+
		"LORD BARDOLPH\n"+
		"I spake with one, my lord, that came from thence,\n"+
		"A gentleman well bred and of good name,\n"+
		"That freely render'd me these news for true.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"Here comes my servant Travers, whom I sent\n"+
		"On Tuesday last to listen after news.\n"+
		"Enter TRAVERS\n"+
		"LORD BARDOLPH\n"+
		"My lord, I over-rode him on the way;\n"+
		"And he is furnish'd with no certainties\n"+
		"More than he haply may retail from me.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"Now, Travers, what good tidings comes with you?\n"+
		"TRAVERS\n"+
		"My lord, Sir John Umfrevile turn'd me back\n"+
		"With joyful tidings; and, being better horsed,\n"+
		"Out-rode me. After him came spurring hard\n"+
		"A gentleman, almost forspent with speed,\n"+
		"That stopp'd by me to breathe his bloodied horse.\n"+
		"He ask'd the way to Chester; and of him\n"+
		"I did demand what news from Shrewsbury:\n"+
		"He told me that rebellion had bad luck\n"+
		"And that young Harry Percy's spur was cold.\n"+
		"With that, he gave his able horse the head,\n"+
		"And bending forward struck his armed heels\n"+
		"Against the panting sides of his poor jade\n"+
		"Up to the rowel-head, and starting so\n"+
		"He seem'd in running to devour the way,\n"+
		"Staying no longer question.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"Ha! Again:\n"+
		"Said he young Harry Percy's spur was cold?\n"+
		"Of Hotspur Coldspur? that rebellion\n"+
		"Had met ill luck?\n"+
		"LORD BARDOLPH\n"+
		"My lord, I'll tell you what;\n"+
		"If my young lord your son have not the day,\n"+
		"Upon mine honour, for a silken point\n"+
		"I'll give my barony: never talk of it.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"Why should that gentleman that rode by Travers\n"+
		"Give then such instances of loss?\n"+
		"LORD BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Who, he?\n"+
		"He was some hilding fellow that had stolen\n"+
		"The horse he rode on, and, upon my life,\n"+
		"Spoke at a venture. Look, here comes more news.\n"+
		"Enter MORTON\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"Yea, this man's brow, like to a title-leaf,\n"+
		"Foretells the nature of a tragic volume:\n"+
		"So looks the strand whereon the imperious flood\n"+
		"Hath left a witness'd usurpation.\n"+
		"Say, Morton, didst thou come from Shrewsbury?\n"+
		"MORTON\n"+
		"I ran from Shrewsbury, my noble lord;\n"+
		"Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask\n"+
		"To fright our party.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"How doth my son and brother?\n"+
		"Thou tremblest; and the whiteness in thy cheek\n"+
		"Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand.\n"+
		"Even such a man, so faint, so spiritless,\n"+
		"So dull, so dead in look, so woe-begone,\n"+
		"Drew Priam's curtain in the dead of night,\n"+
		"And would have told him half his Troy was burnt;\n"+
		"But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue,\n"+
		"And I my Percy's death ere thou report'st it.\n"+
		"This thou wouldst say, 'Your son did thus and thus;\n"+
		"Your brother thus: so fought the noble Douglas:'\n"+
		"Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds:\n"+
		"But in the end, to stop my ear indeed,\n"+
		"Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise,\n"+
		"Ending with 'Brother, son, and all are dead.'\n"+
		"MORTON\n"+
		"Douglas is living, and your brother, yet;\n"+
		"But, for my lord your son--\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"Why, he is dead.\n"+
		"See what a ready tongue suspicion hath!\n"+
		"He that but fears the thing he would not know\n"+
		"Hath by instinct knowledge from others' eyes\n"+
		"That what he fear'd is chanced. Yet speak, Morton;\n"+
		"Tell thou an earl his divination lies,\n"+
		"And I will take it as a sweet disgrace\n"+
		"And make thee rich for doing me such wrong.\n"+
		"MORTON\n"+
		"You are too great to be by me gainsaid:\n"+
		"Your spirit is too true, your fears too certain.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"Yet, for all this, say not that Percy's dead.\n"+
		"I see a strange confession in thine eye:\n"+
		"Thou shakest thy head and hold'st it fear or sin\n"+
		"To speak a truth. If he be slain, say so;\n"+
		"The tongue offends not that reports his death:\n"+
		"And he doth sin that doth belie the dead,\n"+
		"Not he which says the dead is not alive.\n"+
		"Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news\n"+
		"Hath but a losing office, and his tongue\n"+
		"Sounds ever after as a sullen bell,\n"+
		"Remember'd tolling a departing friend.\n"+
		"LORD BARDOLPH\n"+
		"I cannot think, my lord, your son is dead.\n"+
		"MORTON\n"+
		"I am sorry I should force you to believe\n"+
		"That which I would to God I had not seen;\n"+
		"But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state,\n"+
		"Rendering faint quittance, wearied and out-breathed,\n"+
		"To Harry Monmouth; whose swift wrath beat down\n"+
		"The never-daunted Percy to the earth,\n"+
		"From whence with life he never more sprung up.\n"+
		"In few, his death, whose spirit lent a fire\n"+
		"Even to the dullest peasant in his camp,\n"+
		"Being bruited once, took fire and heat away\n"+
		"From the best temper'd courage in his troops;\n"+
		"For from his metal was his party steel'd;\n"+
		"Which once in him abated, all the rest\n"+
		"Turn'd on themselves, like dull and heavy lead:\n"+
		"And as the thing that's heavy in itself,\n"+
		"Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed,\n"+
		"So did our men, heavy in Hotspur's loss,\n"+
		"Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear\n"+
		"That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim\n"+
		"Than did our soldiers, aiming at their safety,\n"+
		"Fly from the field. Then was the noble Worcester\n"+
		"Too soon ta'en prisoner; and that furious Scot,\n"+
		"The bloody Douglas, whose well-labouring sword\n"+
		"Had three times slain the appearance of the king,\n"+
		"'Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame\n"+
		"Of those that turn'd their backs, and in his flight,\n"+
		"Stumbling in fear, was took. The sum of all\n"+
		"Is that the king hath won, and hath sent out\n"+
		"A speedy power to encounter you, my lord,\n"+
		"Under the conduct of young Lancaster\n"+
		"And Westmoreland. This is the news at full.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"For this I shall have time enough to mourn.\n"+
		"In poison there is physic; and these news,\n"+
		"Having been well, that would have made me sick,\n"+
		"Being sick, have in some measure made me well:\n"+
		"And as the wretch, whose fever-weaken'd joints,\n"+
		"Like strengthless hinges, buckle under life,\n"+
		"Impatient of his fit, breaks like a fire\n"+
		"Out of his keeper's arms, even so my limbs,\n"+
		"Weaken'd with grief, being now enraged with grief,\n"+
		"Are thrice themselves. Hence, therefore, thou nice crutch!\n"+
		"A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel\n"+
		"Must glove this hand: and hence, thou sickly quoif!\n"+
		"Thou art a guard too wanton for the head\n"+
		"Which princes, flesh'd with conquest, aim to hit.\n"+
		"Now bind my brows with iron; and approach\n"+
		"The ragged'st hour that time and spite dare bring\n"+
		"To frown upon the enraged Northumberland!\n"+
		"Let heaven kiss earth! now let not Nature's hand\n"+
		"Keep the wild flood confined! let order die!\n"+
		"And let this world no longer be a stage\n"+
		"To feed contention in a lingering act;\n"+
		"But let one spirit of the first-born Cain\n"+
		"Reign in all bosoms, that, each heart being set\n"+
		"On bloody courses, the rude scene may end,\n"+
		"And darkness be the burier of the dead!\n"+
		"TRAVERS\n"+
		"This strained passion doth you wrong, my lord.\n"+
		"LORD BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Sweet earl, divorce not wisdom from your honour.\n"+
		"MORTON\n"+
		"The lives of all your loving complices\n"+
		"Lean on your health; the which, if you give o'er\n"+
		"To stormy passion, must perforce decay.\n"+
		"You cast the event of war, my noble lord,\n"+
		"And summ'd the account of chance, before you said\n"+
		"'Let us make head.' It was your presurmise,\n"+
		"That, in the dole of blows, your son might drop:\n"+
		"You knew he walk'd o'er perils, on an edge,\n"+
		"More likely to fall in than to get o'er;\n"+
		"You were advised his flesh was capable\n"+
		"Of wounds and scars and that his forward spirit\n"+
		"Would lift him where most trade of danger ranged:\n"+
		"Yet did you say 'Go forth;' and none of this,\n"+
		"Though strongly apprehended, could restrain\n"+
		"The stiff-borne action: what hath then befallen,\n"+
		"Or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth,\n"+
		"More than that being which was like to be?\n"+
		"LORD BARDOLPH\n"+
		"We all that are engaged to this loss\n"+
		"Knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas\n"+
		"That if we wrought our life 'twas ten to one;\n"+
		"And yet we ventured, for the gain proposed\n"+
		"Choked the respect of likely peril fear'd;\n"+
		"And since we are o'erset, venture again.\n"+
		"Come, we will all put forth, body and goods.\n"+
		"MORTON\n"+
		"'Tis more than time: and, my most noble lord,\n"+
		"I hear for certain, and do speak the truth,\n"+
		"The gentle Archbishop of York is up\n"+
		"With well-appointed powers: he is a man\n"+
		"Who with a double surety binds his followers.\n"+
		"My lord your son had only but the corpse,\n"+
		"But shadows and the shows of men, to fight;\n"+
		"For that same word, rebellion, did divide\n"+
		"The action of their bodies from their souls;\n"+
		"And they did fight with queasiness, constrain'd,\n"+
		"As men drink potions, that their weapons only\n"+
		"Seem'd on our side; but, for their spirits and souls,\n"+
		"This word, rebellion, it had froze them up,\n"+
		"As fish are in a pond. But now the bishop\n"+
		"Turns insurrection to religion:\n"+
		"Supposed sincere and holy in his thoughts,\n"+
		"He's followed both with body and with mind;\n"+
		"And doth enlarge his rising with the blood\n"+
		"Of fair King Richard, scraped from Pomfret stones;\n"+
		"Derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause;\n"+
		"Tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land,\n"+
		"Gasping for life under great Bolingbroke;\n"+
		"And more and less do flock to follow him.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"I knew of this before; but, to speak truth,\n"+
		"This present grief had wiped it from my mind.\n"+
		"Go in with me; and counsel every man\n"+
		"The aptest way for safety and revenge:\n"+
		"Get posts and letters, and make friends with speed:\n"+
		"Never so few, and never yet more need.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. London. A street.\n"+
		"Enter FALSTAFF, with his Page bearing his sword and buckler\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Sirrah, you giant, what says the doctor to my water?\n"+
		"Page\n"+
		"He said, sir, the water itself was a good healthy\n"+
		"water; but, for the party that owed it, he might\n"+
		"have more diseases than he knew for.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me: the\n"+
		"brain of this foolish-compounded clay, man, is not\n"+
		"able to invent anything that tends to laughter, more\n"+
		"than I invent or is invented on me: I am not only\n"+
		"witty in myself, but the cause that wit is in other\n"+
		"men. I do here walk before thee like a sow that\n"+
		"hath overwhelmed all her litter but one. If the\n"+
		"prince put thee into my service for any other reason\n"+
		"than to set me off, why then I have no judgment.\n"+
		"Thou whoreson mandrake, thou art fitter to be worn\n"+
		"in my cap than to wait at my heels. I was never\n"+
		"manned with an agate till now: but I will inset you\n"+
		"neither in gold nor silver, but in vile apparel, and\n"+
		"send you back again to your master, for a jewel,--\n"+
		"the juvenal, the prince your master, whose chin is\n"+
		"not yet fledged. I will sooner have a beard grow in\n"+
		"the palm of my hand than he shall get one on his\n"+
		"cheek; and yet he will not stick to say his face is\n"+
		"a face-royal: God may finish it when he will, 'tis\n"+
		"not a hair amiss yet: he may keep it still at a\n"+
		"face-royal, for a barber shall never earn sixpence\n"+
		"out of it; and yet he'll be crowing as if he had\n"+
		"writ man ever since his father was a bachelor. He\n"+
		"may keep his own grace, but he's almost out of mine,\n"+
		"I can assure him. What said Master Dombledon about\n"+
		"the satin for my short cloak and my slops?\n"+
		"Page\n"+
		"He said, sir, you should procure him better\n"+
		"assurance than Bardolph: he would not take his\n"+
		"band and yours; he liked not the security.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Let him be damned, like the glutton! pray God his\n"+
		"tongue be hotter! A whoreson Achitophel! a rascally\n"+
		"yea-forsooth knave! to bear a gentleman in hand,\n"+
		"and then stand upon security! The whoreson\n"+
		"smooth-pates do now wear nothing but high shoes, and\n"+
		"bunches of keys at their girdles; and if a man is\n"+
		"through with them in honest taking up, then they\n"+
		"must stand upon security. I had as lief they would\n"+
		"put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop it with\n"+
		"security. I looked a' should have sent me two and\n"+
		"twenty yards of satin, as I am a true knight, and he\n"+
		"sends me security. Well, he may sleep in security;\n"+
		"for he hath the horn of abundance, and the lightness\n"+
		"of his wife shines through it: and yet cannot he\n"+
		"see, though he have his own lanthorn to light him.\n"+
		"Where's Bardolph?\n"+
		"Page\n"+
		"He's gone into Smithfield to buy your worship a horse.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"I bought him in Paul's, and he'll buy me a horse in\n"+
		"Smithfield: an I could get me but a wife in the\n"+
		"stews, I were manned, horsed, and wived.\n"+
		"Enter the Lord Chief-Justice and Servant\n"+
		"Page\n"+
		"Sir, here comes the nobleman that committed the\n"+
		"Prince for striking him about Bardolph.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Wait, close; I will not see him.\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice What's he that goes there?\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"Falstaff, an't please your lordship.\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice He that was in question for the robbery?\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"He, my lord: but he hath since done good service at\n"+
		"Shrewsbury; and, as I hear, is now going with some\n"+
		"charge to the Lord John of Lancaster.\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice What, to York? Call him back again.\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"Sir John Falstaff!\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Boy, tell him I am deaf.\n"+
		"Page\n"+
		"You must speak louder; my master is deaf.\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice I am sure he is, to the hearing of any thing good.\n"+
		"Go, pluck him by the elbow; I must speak with him.\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"Sir John!\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"What! a young knave, and begging! Is there not\n"+
		"wars? is there not employment? doth not the king\n"+
		"lack subjects? do not the rebels need soldiers?\n"+
		"Though it be a shame to be on any side but one, it\n"+
		"is worse shame to beg than to be on the worst side,\n"+
		"were it worse than the name of rebellion can tell\n"+
		"how to make it.\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"You mistake me, sir.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Why, sir, did I say you were an honest man? setting\n"+
		"my knighthood and my soldiership aside, I had lied\n"+
		"in my throat, if I had said so.\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"I pray you, sir, then set your knighthood and our\n"+
		"soldiership aside; and give me leave to tell you,\n"+
		"you lie in your throat, if you say I am any other\n"+
		"than an honest man.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"I give thee leave to tell me so! I lay aside that\n"+
		"which grows to me! if thou gettest any leave of me,\n"+
		"hang me; if thou takest leave, thou wert better be\n"+
		"hanged. You hunt counter: hence! avaunt!\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"Sir, my lord would speak with you.\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice Sir John Falstaff, a word with you.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"My good lord! God give your lordship good time of\n"+
		"day. I am glad to see your lordship abroad: I heard\n"+
		"say your lordship was sick: I hope your lordship\n"+
		"goes abroad by advice. Your lordship, though not\n"+
		"clean past your youth, hath yet some smack of age in\n"+
		"you, some relish of the saltness of time; and I must\n"+
		"humbly beseech your lordship to have a reverent care\n"+
		"of your health.\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice Sir John, I sent for you before your expedition to\n"+
		"Shrewsbury.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"An't please your lordship, I hear his majesty is\n"+
		"returned with some discomfort from Wales.\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice I talk not of his majesty: you would not come when\n"+
		"I sent for you.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"And I hear, moreover, his highness is fallen into\n"+
		"this same whoreson apoplexy.\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice Well, God mend him! I pray you, let me speak with\n"+
		"you.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"This apoplexy is, as I take it, a kind of lethargy,\n"+
		"an't please your lordship; a kind of sleeping in the\n"+
		"blood, a whoreson tingling.\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice What tell you me of it? be it as it is.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"It hath its original from much grief, from study and\n"+
		"perturbation of the brain: I have read the cause of\n"+
		"his effects in Galen: it is a kind of deafness.\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice I think you are fallen into the disease; for you\n"+
		"hear not what I say to you.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Very well, my lord, very well: rather, an't please\n"+
		"you, it is the disease of not listening, the malady\n"+
		"of not marking, that I am troubled withal.\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice To punish you by the heels would amend the\n"+
		"attention of your ears; and I care not if I do\n"+
		"become your physician.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"I am as poor as Job, my lord, but not so patient:\n"+
		"your lordship may minister the potion of\n"+
		"imprisonment to me in respect of poverty; but how\n"+
		"should I be your patient to follow your\n"+
		"prescriptions, the wise may make some dram of a\n"+
		"scruple, or indeed a scruple itself.\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice I sent for you, when there were matters against you\n"+
		"for your life, to come speak with me.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"As I was then advised by my learned counsel in the\n"+
		"laws of this land-service, I did not come.\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice Well, the truth is, Sir John, you live in great infamy.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"He that buckles him in my belt cannot live in less.\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice Your means are very slender, and your waste is great.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"I would it were otherwise; I would my means were\n"+
		"greater, and my waist slenderer.\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice You have misled the youthful prince.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"The young prince hath misled me: I am the fellow\n"+
		"with the great belly, and he my dog.\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice Well, I am loath to gall a new-healed wound: your\n"+
		"day's service at Shrewsbury hath a little gilded\n"+
		"over your night's exploit on Gad's-hill: you may\n"+
		"thank the unquiet time for your quiet o'er-posting\n"+
		"that action.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"My lord?\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice But since all is well, keep it so: wake not a\n"+
		"sleeping wolf.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"To wake a wolf is as bad as to smell a fox.\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice What! you are as a candle, the better part burnt\n"+
		"out.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"A wassail candle, my lord, all tallow: if I did say\n"+
		"of wax, my growth would approve the truth.\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice There is not a white hair on your face but should\n"+
		"have his effect of gravity.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"His effect of gravy, gravy, gravy.\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice You follow the young prince up and down, like his\n"+
		"ill angel.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Not so, my lord; your ill angel is light; but I hope\n"+
		"he that looks upon me will take me without weighing:\n"+
		"and yet, in some respects, I grant, I cannot go: I\n"+
		"cannot tell. Virtue is of so little regard in these\n"+
		"costermonger times that true valour is turned\n"+
		"bear-herd: pregnancy is made a tapster, and hath\n"+
		"his quick wit wasted in giving reckonings: all the\n"+
		"other gifts appertinent to man, as the malice of\n"+
		"this age shapes them, are not worth a gooseberry.\n"+
		"You that are old consider not the capacities of us\n"+
		"that are young; you do measure the heat of our\n"+
		"livers with the bitterness of your galls: and we\n"+
		"that are in the vaward of our youth, I must confess,\n"+
		"are wags too.\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice Do you set down your name in the scroll of youth,\n"+
		"that are written down old with all the characters of\n"+
		"age? Have you not a moist eye? a dry hand? a\n"+
		"yellow cheek? a white beard? a decreasing leg? an\n"+
		"increasing belly? is not your voice broken? your\n"+
		"wind short? your chin double? your wit single? and\n"+
		"every part about you blasted with antiquity? and\n"+
		"will you yet call yourself young? Fie, fie, fie, Sir John!\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"My lord, I was born about three of the clock in the\n"+
		"afternoon, with a white head and something a round\n"+
		"belly. For my voice, I have lost it with halloing\n"+
		"and singing of anthems. To approve my youth\n"+
		"further, I will not: the truth is, I am only old in\n"+
		"judgment and understanding; and he that will caper\n"+
		"with me for a thousand marks, let him lend me the\n"+
		"money, and have at him! For the box of the ear that\n"+
		"the prince gave you, he gave it like a rude prince,\n"+
		"and you took it like a sensible lord. I have\n"+
		"chequed him for it, and the young lion repents;\n"+
		"marry, not in ashes and sackcloth, but in new silk\n"+
		"and old sack.\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice Well, God send the prince a better companion!\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"God send the companion a better prince! I cannot\n"+
		"rid my hands of him.\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice Well, the king hath severed you and Prince Harry: I\n"+
		"hear you are going with Lord John of Lancaster\n"+
		"against the Archbishop and the Earl of\n"+
		"Northumberland.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Yea; I thank your pretty sweet wit for it. But look\n"+
		"you pray, all you that kiss my lady Peace at home,\n"+
		"that our armies join not in a hot day; for, by the\n"+
		"Lord, I take but two shirts out with me, and I mean\n"+
		"not to sweat extraordinarily: if it be a hot day,\n"+
		"and I brandish any thing but a bottle, I would I\n"+
		"might never spit white again. There is not a\n"+
		"dangerous action can peep out his head but I am\n"+
		"thrust upon it: well, I cannot last ever: but it\n"+
		"was alway yet the trick of our English nation, if\n"+
		"they have a good thing, to make it too common. If\n"+
		"ye will needs say I am an old man, you should give\n"+
		"me rest. I would to God my name were not so\n"+
		"terrible to the enemy as it is: I were better to be\n"+
		"eaten to death with a rust than to be scoured to\n"+
		"nothing with perpetual motion.\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice Well, be honest, be honest; and God bless your\n"+
		"expedition!\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Will your lordship lend me a thousand pound to\n"+
		"furnish me forth?\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice Not a penny, not a penny; you are too impatient to\n"+
		"bear crosses. Fare you well: commend me to my\n"+
		"cousin Westmoreland.\n"+
		"Exeunt Chief-Justice and Servant\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"If I do, fillip me with a three-man beetle. A man\n"+
		"can no more separate age and covetousness than a'\n"+
		"can part young limbs and lechery: but the gout\n"+
		"galls the one, and the pox pinches the other; and\n"+
		"so both the degrees prevent my curses. Boy!\n"+
		"Page\n"+
		"Sir?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"What money is in my purse?\n"+
		"Page\n"+
		"Seven groats and two pence.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"I can get no remedy against this consumption of the\n"+
		"purse: borrowing only lingers and lingers it out,\n"+
		"but the disease is incurable. Go bear this letter\n"+
		"to my Lord of Lancaster; this to the prince; this\n"+
		"to the Earl of Westmoreland; and this to old\n"+
		"Mistress Ursula, whom I have weekly sworn to marry\n"+
		"since I perceived the first white hair on my chin.\n"+
		"About it: you know where to find me.\n"+
		"Exit Page\n"+
		"A pox of this gout! or, a gout of this pox! for\n"+
		"the one or the other plays the rogue with my great\n"+
		"toe. 'Tis no matter if I do halt; I have the wars\n"+
		"for my colour, and my pension shall seem the more\n"+
		"reasonable. A good wit will make use of any thing:\n"+
		"I will turn diseases to commodity.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE III. York. The Archbishop's palace.\n"+
		"Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, the Lords HASTINGS, MOWBRAY, and BARDOLPH\n"+
		"ARCHBISHOP OF YORK\n"+
		"Thus have you heard our cause and known our means;\n"+
		"And, my most noble friends, I pray you all,\n"+
		"Speak plainly your opinions of our hopes:\n"+
		"And first, lord marshal, what say you to it?\n"+
		"MOWBRAY\n"+
		"I well allow the occasion of our arms;\n"+
		"But gladly would be better satisfied\n"+
		"How in our means we should advance ourselves\n"+
		"To look with forehead bold and big enough\n"+
		"Upon the power and puissance of the king.\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"Our present musters grow upon the file\n"+
		"To five and twenty thousand men of choice;\n"+
		"And our supplies live largely in the hope\n"+
		"Of great Northumberland, whose bosom burns\n"+
		"With an incensed fire of injuries.\n"+
		"LORD BARDOLPH\n"+
		"The question then, Lord Hastings, standeth thus;\n"+
		"Whether our present five and twenty thousand\n"+
		"May hold up head without Northumberland?\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"With him, we may.\n"+
		"LORD BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Yea, marry, there's the point:\n"+
		"But if without him we be thought too feeble,\n"+
		"My judgment is, we should not step too far\n"+
		"Till we had his assistance by the hand;\n"+
		"For in a theme so bloody-faced as this\n"+
		"Conjecture, expectation, and surmise\n"+
		"Of aids incertain should not be admitted.\n"+
		"ARCHBISHOP OF YORK\n"+
		"'Tis very true, Lord Bardolph; for indeed\n"+
		"It was young Hotspur's case at Shrewsbury.\n"+
		"LORD BARDOLPH\n"+
		"It was, my lord; who lined himself with hope,\n"+
		"Eating the air on promise of supply,\n"+
		"Flattering himself in project of a power\n"+
		"Much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts:\n"+
		"And so, with great imagination\n"+
		"Proper to madmen, led his powers to death\n"+
		"And winking leap'd into destruction.\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"But, by your leave, it never yet did hurt\n"+
		"To lay down likelihoods and forms of hope.\n"+
		"LORD BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Yes, if this present quality of war,\n"+
		"Indeed the instant action: a cause on foot\n"+
		"Lives so in hope as in an early spring\n"+
		"We see the appearing buds; which to prove fruit,\n"+
		"Hope gives not so much warrant as despair\n"+
		"That frosts will bite them. When we mean to build,\n"+
		"We first survey the plot, then draw the model;\n"+
		"And when we see the figure of the house,\n"+
		"Then must we rate the cost of the erection;\n"+
		"Which if we find outweighs ability,\n"+
		"What do we then but draw anew the model\n"+
		"In fewer offices, or at last desist\n"+
		"To build at all? Much more, in this great work,\n"+
		"Which is almost to pluck a kingdom down\n"+
		"And set another up, should we survey\n"+
		"The plot of situation and the model,\n"+
		"Consent upon a sure foundation,\n"+
		"Question surveyors, know our own estate,\n"+
		"How able such a work to undergo,\n"+
		"To weigh against his opposite; or else\n"+
		"We fortify in paper and in figures,\n"+
		"Using the names of men instead of men:\n"+
		"Like one that draws the model of a house\n"+
		"Beyond his power to build it; who, half through,\n"+
		"Gives o'er and leaves his part-created cost\n"+
		"A naked subject to the weeping clouds\n"+
		"And waste for churlish winter's tyranny.\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"Grant that our hopes, yet likely of fair birth,\n"+
		"Should be still-born, and that we now possess'd\n"+
		"The utmost man of expectation,\n"+
		"I think we are a body strong enough,\n"+
		"Even as we are, to equal with the king.\n"+
		"LORD BARDOLPH\n"+
		"What, is the king but five and twenty thousand?\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"To us no more; nay, not so much, Lord Bardolph.\n"+
		"For his divisions, as the times do brawl,\n"+
		"Are in three heads: one power against the French,\n"+
		"And one against Glendower; perforce a third\n"+
		"Must take up us: so is the unfirm king\n"+
		"In three divided; and his coffers sound\n"+
		"With hollow poverty and emptiness.\n"+
		"ARCHBISHOP OF YORK\n"+
		"That he should draw his several strengths together\n"+
		"And come against us in full puissance,\n"+
		"Need not be dreaded.\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"If he should do so,\n"+
		"He leaves his back unarm'd, the French and Welsh\n"+
		"Baying him at the heels: never fear that.\n"+
		"LORD BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Who is it like should lead his forces hither?\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"The Duke of Lancaster and Westmoreland;\n"+
		"Against the Welsh, himself and Harry Monmouth:\n"+
		"But who is substituted 'gainst the French,\n"+
		"I have no certain notice.\n"+
		"ARCHBISHOP OF YORK\n"+
		"Let us on,\n"+
		"And publish the occasion of our arms.\n"+
		"The commonwealth is sick of their own choice;\n"+
		"Their over-greedy love hath surfeited:\n"+
		"An habitation giddy and unsure\n"+
		"Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart.\n"+
		"O thou fond many, with what loud applause\n"+
		"Didst thou beat heaven with blessing Bolingbroke,\n"+
		"Before he was what thou wouldst have him be!\n"+
		"And being now trimm'd in thine own desires,\n"+
		"Thou, beastly feeder, art so full of him,\n"+
		"That thou provokest thyself to cast him up.\n"+
		"So, so, thou common dog, didst thou disgorge\n"+
		"Thy glutton bosom of the royal Richard;\n"+
		"And now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up,\n"+
		"And howl'st to find it. What trust is in\n"+
		"these times?\n"+
		"They that, when Richard lived, would have him die,\n"+
		"Are now become enamour'd on his grave:\n"+
		"Thou, that threw'st dust upon his goodly head\n"+
		"When through proud London he came sighing on\n"+
		"After the admired heels of Bolingbroke,\n"+
		"Criest now 'O earth, yield us that king again,\n"+
		"And take thou this!' O thoughts of men accursed!\n"+
		"Past and to come seems best; things present worst.\n"+
		"MOWBRAY\n"+
		"Shall we go draw our numbers and set on?\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"We are time's subjects, and time bids be gone.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT II\n"+
		"SCENE I. London. A street.\n"+
		"Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY, FANG and his Boy with her, and SNARE following.\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"Master Fang, have you entered the action?\n"+
		"FANG\n"+
		"It is entered.\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"Where's your yeoman? Is't a lusty yeoman? will a'\n"+
		"stand to 't?\n"+
		"FANG\n"+
		"Sirrah, where's Snare?\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"O Lord, ay! good Master Snare.\n"+
		"SNARE\n"+
		"Here, here.\n"+
		"FANG\n"+
		"Snare, we must arrest Sir John Falstaff.\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"Yea, good Master Snare; I have entered him and all.\n"+
		"SNARE\n"+
		"It may chance cost some of us our lives, for he will stab.\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"Alas the day! take heed of him; he stabbed me in\n"+
		"mine own house, and that most beastly: in good\n"+
		"faith, he cares not what mischief he does. If his\n"+
		"weapon be out: he will foin like any devil; he will\n"+
		"spare neither man, woman, nor child.\n"+
		"FANG\n"+
		"If I can close with him, I care not for his thrust.\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"No, nor I neither: I'll be at your elbow.\n"+
		"FANG\n"+
		"An I but fist him once; an a' come but within my vice,--\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"I am undone by his going; I warrant you, he's an\n"+
		"infinitive thing upon my score. Good Master Fang,\n"+
		"hold him sure: good Master Snare, let him not\n"+
		"'scape. A' comes continuantly to Pie-corner--saving\n"+
		"your manhoods--to buy a saddle; and he is indited to\n"+
		"dinner to the Lubber's-head in Lumbert street, to\n"+
		"Master Smooth's the silkman: I pray ye, since my\n"+
		"exion is entered and my case so openly known to the\n"+
		"world, let him be brought in to his answer. A\n"+
		"hundred mark is a long one for a poor lone woman to\n"+
		"bear: and I have borne, and borne, and borne, and\n"+
		"have been fubbed off, and fubbed off, and fubbed\n"+
		"off, from this day to that day, that it is a shame\n"+
		"to be thought on. There is no honesty in such\n"+

		"beast, to bear every knave's wrong. Yonder he\n"+
		"comes; and that errant malmsey-nose knave, Bardolph,\n"+
		"with him. Do your offices, do your offices: Master\n"+
		"Fang and Master Snare, do me, do me, do me your offices.\n"+
		"Enter FALSTAFF, Page, and BARDOLPH\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"How now! whose mare's dead? what's the matter?\n"+
		"FANG\n"+
		"Sir John, I arrest you at the suit of Mistress Quickly.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Away, varlets! Draw, Bardolph: cut me off the\n"+
		"villain's head: throw the quean in the channel.\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"Throw me in the channel! I'll throw thee in the\n"+
		"channel. Wilt thou? wilt thou? thou bastardly\n"+
		"rogue! Murder, murder! Ah, thou honeysuckle\n"+
		"villain! wilt thou kill God's officers and the\n"+
		"king's? Ah, thou honey-seed rogue! thou art a\n"+
		"honey-seed, a man-queller, and a woman-queller.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Keep them off, Bardolph.\n"+
		"FANG\n"+
		"A rescue! a rescue!\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"Good people, bring a rescue or two. Thou wo't, wo't\n"+
		"thou? Thou wo't, wo't ta? do, do, thou rogue! do,\n"+
		"thou hemp-seed!\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Away, you scullion! you rampallion! You\n"+
		"fustilarian! I'll tickle your catastrophe.\n"+
		"Enter the Lord Chief-Justice, and his men\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice What is the matter? keep the peace here, ho!\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"Good my lord, be good to me. I beseech you, stand to me.\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice How now, Sir John! what are you brawling here?\n"+
		"Doth this become your place, your time and business?\n"+
		"You should have been well on your way to York.\n"+
		"Stand from him, fellow: wherefore hang'st upon him?\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"O most worshipful lord, an't please your grace, I am\n"+
		"a poor widow of Eastcheap, and he is arrested at my suit.\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice For what sum?\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"It is more than for some, my lord; it is for all,\n"+
		"all I have. He hath eaten me out of house and home;\n"+
		"he hath put all my substance into that fat belly of\n"+
		"his: but I will have some of it out again, or I\n"+
		"will ride thee o' nights like the mare.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"I think I am as like to ride the mare, if I have\n"+
		"any vantage of ground to get up.\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice How comes this, Sir John? Fie! what man of good\n"+
		"temper would endure this tempest of exclamation?\n"+
		"Are you not ashamed to enforce a poor widow to so\n"+
		"rough a course to come by her own?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"What is the gross sum that I owe thee?\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"Marry, if thou wert an honest man, thyself and the\n"+
		"money too. Thou didst swear to me upon a\n"+
		"parcel-gilt goblet, sitting in my Dolphin-chamber,\n"+
		"at the round table, by a sea-coal fire, upon\n"+
		"Wednesday in Wheeson week, when the prince broke\n"+
		"thy head for liking his father to a singing-man of\n"+
		"Windsor, thou didst swear to me then, as I was\n"+
		"washing thy wound, to marry me and make me my lady\n"+
		"thy wife. Canst thou deny it? Did not goodwife\n"+
		"Keech, the butcher's wife, come in then and call me\n"+
		"gossip Quickly? coming in to borrow a mess of\n"+
		"vinegar; telling us she had a good dish of prawns;\n"+
		"whereby thou didst desire to eat some; whereby I\n"+
		"told thee they were ill for a green wound? And\n"+
		"didst thou not, when she was gone down stairs,\n"+
		"desire me to be no more so familiarity with such\n"+
		"poor people; saying that ere long they should call\n"+
		"me madam? And didst thou not kiss me and bid me\n"+
		"fetch thee thirty shillings? I put thee now to thy\n"+
		"book-oath: deny it, if thou canst.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"My lord, this is a poor mad soul; and she says up\n"+
		"and down the town that the eldest son is like you:\n"+
		"she hath been in good case, and the truth is,\n"+
		"poverty hath distracted her. But for these foolish\n"+
		"officers, I beseech you I may have redress against them.\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice Sir John, Sir John, I am well acquainted with your\n"+
		"manner of wrenching the true cause the false way. It\n"+
		"is not a confident brow, nor the throng of words\n"+
		"that come with such more than impudent sauciness\n"+
		"from you, can thrust me from a level consideration:\n"+
		"you have, as it appears to me, practised upon the\n"+
		"easy-yielding spirit of this woman, and made her\n"+
		"serve your uses both in purse and in person.\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"Yea, in truth, my lord.\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice Pray thee, peace. Pay her the debt you owe her, and\n"+
		"unpay the villany you have done her: the one you\n"+
		"may do with sterling money, and the other with\n"+
		"current repentance.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"My lord, I will not undergo this sneap without\n"+
		"reply. You call honourable boldness impudent\n"+
		"sauciness: if a man will make courtesy and say\n"+
		"nothing, he is virtuous: no, my lord, my humble\n"+
		"duty remembered, I will not be your suitor. I say\n"+
		"to you, I do desire deliverance from these officers,\n"+
		"being upon hasty employment in the king's affairs.\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice You speak as having power to do wrong: but answer\n"+
		"in the effect of your reputation, and satisfy this\n"+
		"poor woman.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Come hither, hostess.\n"+
		"Enter GOWER\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice Now, Master Gower, what news?\n"+
		"GOWER\n"+
		"The king, my lord, and Harry Prince of Wales\n"+
		"Are near at hand: the rest the paper tells.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"As I am a gentleman.\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"Faith, you said so before.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"As I am a gentleman. Come, no more words of it.\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"By this heavenly ground I tread on, I must be fain\n"+
		"to pawn both my plate and the tapestry of my\n"+
		"dining-chambers.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Glasses, glasses is the only drinking: and for thy\n"+
		"walls, a pretty slight drollery, or the story of\n"+
		"the Prodigal, or the German hunting in water-work,\n"+
		"is worth a thousand of these bed-hangings and these\n"+
		"fly-bitten tapestries. Let it be ten pound, if thou\n"+
		"canst. Come, an 'twere not for thy humours, there's\n"+
		"not a better wench in England. Go, wash thy face,\n"+
		"and draw the action. Come, thou must not be in\n"+
		"this humour with me; dost not know me? come, come, I\n"+
		"know thou wast set on to this.\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"Pray thee, Sir John, let it be but twenty nobles: i'\n"+
		"faith, I am loath to pawn my plate, so God save me,\n"+
		"la!\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Let it alone; I'll make other shift: you'll be a\n"+
		"fool still.\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"Well, you shall have it, though I pawn my gown. I\n"+
		"hope you'll come to supper. You'll pay me all together?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Will I live?\n"+
		"To BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Go, with her, with her; hook on, hook on.\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"Will you have Doll Tearsheet meet you at supper?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"No more words; let's have her.\n"+
		"Exeunt MISTRESS QUICKLY, BARDOLPH, Officers and Boy\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice I have heard better news.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"What's the news, my lord?\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice Where lay the king last night?\n"+
		"GOWER\n"+
		"At Basingstoke, my lord.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"I hope, my lord, all's well: what is the news, my lord?\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice Come all his forces back?\n"+
		"GOWER\n"+
		"No; fifteen hundred foot, five hundred horse,\n"+
		"Are marched up to my lord of Lancaster,\n"+
		"Against Northumberland and the Archbishop.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Comes the king back from Wales, my noble lord?\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice You shall have letters of me presently:\n"+
		"Come, go along with me, good Master Gower.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"My lord!\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice What's the matter?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Master Gower, shall I entreat you with me to dinner?\n"+
		"GOWER\n"+
		"I must wait upon my good lord here; I thank you,\n"+
		"good Sir John.\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice Sir John, you loiter here too long, being you are to\n"+
		"take soldiers up in counties as you go.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Will you sup with me, Master Gower?\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice What foolish master taught you these manners, Sir John?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Master Gower, if they become me not, he was a fool\n"+
		"that taught them me. This is the right fencing\n"+
		"grace, my lord; tap for tap, and so part fair.\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice Now the Lord lighten thee! thou art a great fool.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. London. Another street.\n"+
		"Enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Before God, I am exceeding weary.\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"Is't come to that? I had thought weariness durst not\n"+
		"have attached one of so high blood.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Faith, it does me; though it discolours the\n"+
		"complexion of my greatness to acknowledge it. Doth\n"+
		"it not show vilely in me to desire small beer?\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"Why, a prince should not be so loosely studied as\n"+
		"to remember so weak a composition.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Belike then my appetite was not princely got; for,\n"+
		"by my troth, I do now remember the poor creature,\n"+
		"small beer. But, indeed, these humble\n"+
		"considerations make me out of love with my\n"+
		"greatness. What a disgrace is it to me to remember\n"+
		"thy name! or to know thy face to-morrow! or to\n"+
		"take note how many pair of silk stockings thou\n"+
		"hast, viz. these, and those that were thy\n"+
		"peach-coloured ones! or to bear the inventory of thy\n"+
		"shirts, as, one for superfluity, and another for\n"+
		"use! But that the tennis-court-keeper knows better\n"+
		"than I; for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when\n"+
		"thou keepest not racket there; as thou hast not done\n"+
		"a great while, because the rest of thy low\n"+
		"countries have made a shift to eat up thy holland:\n"+
		"and God knows, whether those that bawl out the ruins\n"+
		"of thy linen shall inherit his kingdom: but the\n"+
		"midwives say the children are not in the fault;\n"+
		"whereupon the world increases, and kindreds are\n"+
		"mightily strengthened.\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"How ill it follows, after you have laboured so hard,\n"+
		"you should talk so idly! Tell me, how many good\n"+
		"young princes would do so, their fathers being so\n"+
		"sick as yours at this time is?\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Shall I tell thee one thing, Poins?\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"Yes, faith; and let it be an excellent good thing.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"It shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than thine.\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"Go to; I stand the push of your one thing that you\n"+
		"will tell.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Marry, I tell thee, it is not meet that I should be\n"+
		"sad, now my father is sick: albeit I could tell\n"+
		"thee, as to one it pleases me, for fault of a\n"+
		"better, to call my friend, I could be sad, and sad\n"+
		"indeed too.\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"Very hardly upon such a subject.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"By this hand thou thinkest me as far in the devil's\n"+
		"book as thou and Falstaff for obduracy and\n"+
		"persistency: let the end try the man. But I tell\n"+
		"thee, my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so\n"+
		"sick: and keeping such vile company as thou art\n"+
		"hath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow.\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"The reason?\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"What wouldst thou think of me, if I should weep?\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"I would think thee a most princely hypocrite.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"It would be every man's thought; and thou art a\n"+
		"blessed fellow to think as every man thinks: never\n"+
		"a man's thought in the world keeps the road-way\n"+
		"better than thine: every man would think me an\n"+
		"hypocrite indeed. And what accites your most\n"+
		"worshipful thought to think so?\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"Why, because you have been so lewd and so much\n"+
		"engraffed to Falstaff.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"And to thee.\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"By this light, I am well spoke on; I can hear it\n"+
		"with my own ears: the worst that they can say of\n"+
		"me is that I am a second brother and that I am a\n"+
		"proper fellow of my hands; and those two things, I\n"+
		"confess, I cannot help. By the mass, here comes Bardolph.\n"+
		"Enter BARDOLPH and Page\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"And the boy that I gave Falstaff: a' had him from\n"+
		"me Christian; and look, if the fat villain have not\n"+
		"transformed him ape.\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"God save your grace!\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"And yours, most noble Bardolph!\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Come, you virtuous ass, you bashful fool, must you\n"+
		"be blushing? wherefore blush you now? What a\n"+
		"maidenly man-at-arms are you become! Is't such a\n"+
		"matter to get a pottle-pot's maidenhead?\n"+
		"Page\n"+
		"A' calls me e'en now, my lord, through a red\n"+
		"lattice, and I could discern no part of his face\n"+
		"from the window: at last I spied his eyes, and\n"+
		"methought he had made two holes in the ale-wife's\n"+
		"new petticoat and so peeped through.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Has not the boy profited?\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Away, you whoreson upright rabbit, away!\n"+
		"Page\n"+
		"Away, you rascally Althaea's dream, away!\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Instruct us, boy; what dream, boy?\n"+
		"Page\n"+
		"Marry, my lord, Althaea dreamed she was delivered\n"+
		"of a fire-brand; and therefore I call him her dream.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"A crown's worth of good interpretation: there 'tis,\n"+
		"boy.\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"O, that this good blossom could be kept from\n"+
		"cankers! Well, there is sixpence to preserve thee.\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"An you do not make him hanged among you, the\n"+
		"gallows shall have wrong.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"And how doth thy master, Bardolph?\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Well, my lord. He heard of your grace's coming to\n"+
		"town: there's a letter for you.\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"Delivered with good respect. And how doth the\n"+
		"martlemas, your master?\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"In bodily health, sir.\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"Marry, the immortal part needs a physician; but\n"+
		"that moves not him: though that be sick, it dies\n"+
		"not.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"I do allow this wen to be as familiar with me as my\n"+
		"dog; and he holds his place; for look you how be writes.\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"[Reads] 'John Falstaff, knight,'--every man must\n"+
		"know that, as oft as he has occasion to name\n"+
		"himself: even like those that are kin to the king;\n"+
		"for they never prick their finger but they say,\n"+
		"'There's some of the king's blood spilt.' 'How\n"+
		"comes that?' says he, that takes upon him not to\n"+
		"conceive. The answer is as ready as a borrower's\n"+
		"cap, 'I am the king's poor cousin, sir.'\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Nay, they will be kin to us, or they will fetch it\n"+
		"from Japhet. But to the letter.\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"[Reads] 'Sir John Falstaff, knight, to the son of\n"+
		"the king, nearest his father, Harry Prince of\n"+
		"Wales, greeting.' Why, this is a certificate.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Peace!\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"[Reads] 'I will imitate the honourable Romans in\n"+
		"brevity:' he sure means brevity in breath,\n"+
		"short-winded. 'I commend me to thee, I commend\n"+
		"thee, and I leave thee. Be not too familiar with\n"+
		"Poins; for he misuses thy favours so much, that he\n"+
		"swears thou art to marry his sister Nell. Repent\n"+
		"at idle times as thou mayest; and so, farewell.\n"+
		"Thine, by yea and no, which is as much as to\n"+
		"say, as thou usest him, JACK FALSTAFF with my\n"+
		"familiars, JOHN with my brothers and sisters,\n"+
		"and SIR JOHN with all Europe.'\n"+
		"My lord, I'll steep this letter in sack and make him eat it.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"That's to make him eat twenty of his words. But do\n"+
		"you use me thus, Ned? must I marry your sister?\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"God send the wench no worse fortune! But I never said so.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Well, thus we play the fools with the time, and the\n"+
		"spirits of the wise sit in the clouds and mock us.\n"+
		"Is your master here in London?\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Yea, my lord.\n"+

		"Page\n"+
		"Ephesians, my lord, of the old church.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Sup any women with him?\n"+
		"Page\n"+
		"None, my lord, but old Mistress Quickly and\n"+
		"Mistress Doll Tearsheet.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"What pagan may that be?\n"+
		"Page\n"+
		"A proper gentlewoman, sir, and a kinswoman of my master's.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Even such kin as the parish heifers are to the town\n"+
		"bull. Shall we steal upon them, Ned, at supper?\n"+
		"POINS\n"+
		"I am your shadow, my lord; I'll follow you.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Sirrah, you boy, and Bardolph, no word to your\n"+

		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. Warkworth. Before the castle.\n"+
		"Enter NORTHUMBERLAND, LADY NORTHUMBERLAND, and LADY PERCY\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"I pray thee, loving wife, and gentle daughter,\n"+
		"Give even way unto my rough affairs:\n"+
		"Put not you on the visage of the times\n"+

		"LADY\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"I have given over, I will speak no more:\n"+
		"Do what you will; your wisdom be your guide.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"Alas, sweet wife, my honour is at pawn;\n"+
		"And, but my going, nothing can redeem it.\n"+
		"LADY PERCY\n"+
		"O yet, for God's sake, go not to these wars!\n"+
		"The time was, father, that you broke your word,\n"+
		"When you were more endeared to it than now;\n"+
		"When your own Percy, when my heart's dear Harry,\n"+
		"Threw many a northward look to see his father\n"+
		"Bring up his powers; but he did long in vain.\n"+
		"Who then persuaded you to stay at home?\n"+
		"There were two honours lost, yours and your son's.\n"+
		"For yours, the God of heaven brighten it!\n"+
		"For his, it stuck upon him as the sun\n"+
		"In the grey vault of heaven, and by his light\n"+
		"Did all the chivalry of England move\n"+
		"To do brave acts: he was indeed the glass\n"+
		"Wherein the noble youth did dress themselves:\n"+
		"He had no legs that practised not his gait;\n"+
		"And speaking thick, which nature made his blemish,\n"+
		"Became the accents of the valiant;\n"+
		"For those that could speak low and tardily\n"+
		"Would turn their own perfection to abuse,\n"+
		"To seem like him: so that in speech, in gait,\n"+
		"In diet, in affections of delight,\n"+
		"In military rules, humours of blood,\n"+
		"He was the mark and glass, copy and book,\n"+
		"That fashion'd others. And him, O wondrous him!\n"+
		"O miracle of men! him did you leave,\n"+
		"Second to none, unseconded by you,\n"+
		"To look upon the hideous god of war\n"+
		"In disadvantage; to abide a field\n"+
		"Where nothing but the sound of Hotspur's name\n"+
		"Did seem defensible: so you left him.\n"+
		"Never, O never, do his ghost the wrong\n"+
		"To hold your honour more precise and nice\n"+
		"With others than with him! let them alone:\n"+
		"The marshal and the archbishop are strong:\n"+
		"Had my sweet Harry had but half their numbers,\n"+
		"To-day might I, hanging on Hotspur's neck,\n"+
		"Have talk'd of Monmouth's grave.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"Beshrew your heart,\n"+
		"Fair daughter, you do draw my spirits from me\n"+

		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"O, fly to Scotland,\n"+
		"Till that the nobles and the armed commons\n"+

		"LADY PERCY\n"+
		"If they get ground and vantage of the king,\n"+
		"Then join you with them, like a rib of steel,\n"+
		"To make strength stronger; but, for all our loves,\n"+
		"First let them try themselves. So did your son;\n"+
		"He was so suffer'd: so came I a widow;\n"+
		"And never shall have length of life enough\n"+
		"To rain upon remembrance with mine eyes,\n"+
		"That it may grow and sprout as high as heaven,\n"+
		"For recordation to my noble husband.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"Come, come, go in with me. 'Tis with my mind\n"+
		"As with the tide swell'd up unto his height,\n"+
		"That makes a still-stand, running neither way:\n"+
		"Fain would I go to meet the archbishop,\n"+
		"But many thousand reasons hold me back.\n"+
		"I will resolve for Scotland: there am I,\n"+

		"First Drawer\n"+
		"What the devil hast thou brought there? apple-johns?\n"+
		"thou knowest Sir John cannot endure an apple-john.\n"+
		"Second Drawer\n"+
		"Mass, thou sayest true. The prince once set a dish\n"+
		"of apple-johns before him, and told him there were\n"+
		"five more Sir Johns, and, putting off his hat, said\n"+
		"'I will now take my leave of these six dry, round,\n"+

		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"By yea and nay, sir, I dare say my cousin William is\n"+

		"SILENCE\n"+
		"Indeed, sir, to my cost.\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"A' must, then, to the inns o' court shortly. I was\n"+
		"once of Clement's Inn, where I think they will\n"+
		"talk of mad Shallow yet.\n"+
		"SILENCE\n"+
		"You were called 'lusty Shallow' then, cousin.\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"By the mass, I was called any thing; and I would\n"+

		"There was I, and little John Doit of Staffordshire,\n"+

		"Will Squele, a Cotswold man; you had not four such\n"+
		"swinge-bucklers in all the inns o' court again: and\n"+
		"I may say to you, we knew where the bona-robas were\n"+

		"This Sir John, cousin, that comes hither anon about soldiers?\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"The same Sir John, the very same. I see him break\n"+

		"crack not thus high: and the very same day did I\n"+
		"fight with one Sampson Stockfish, a fruiterer,\n"+

		"SHADOW\n"+
		"Certain, 'tis certain; very sure, very sure: death,\n"+

		"By my troth, I was not there.\n"+

		"SILENCE\n"+
		"Dead, sir.\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"Jesu, Jesu, dead! a' drew a good bow; and dead! a'\n"+

		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Good morrow, honest gentlemen: I beseech you, which\n"+
		"is Justice Shallow?\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"I am Robert Shallow, sir; a poor esquire of this\n"+
		"county, and one of the king's justices of th e peace:\n"+
		"What is your good pleasure with me?\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"My captain, sir, commends him to you; my captain,\n"+
		"Sir John Falstaff, a tall gentleman, by heaven, and\n"+
		"a most gallant leader.\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"He greets me well, sir. I knew him a good backsword\n"+
		"man. How doth the good knight? may I ask how my\n"+
		"lady his wife doth?\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Sir, pardon; a soldier is better accommodated than\n"+
		"with a wife.\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"It is well said, in faith, sir; and it is well said\n"+
		"indeed too. Better accommodated! it is good; yea,\n"+
		"indeed, is it: good phrases are surely, and ever\n"+
		"were, very commendable. Accommodated! it comes of\n"+
		"'accommodo' very good; a good phrase.\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Pardon me, sir; I have heard the word. Phrase call\n"+
		"you it? by this good day, I know not the phrase;\n"+
		"but I will maintain the word with my sword to be a\n"+
		"soldier-like word, and a word of exceeding good\n"+
		"command, by heaven. Accommodated; that is, when a\n"+
		"man is, as they say, accommodated; or when a man is,\n"+
		"being, whereby a' may be thought to be accommodated;\n"+
		"which is an excellent thing.\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"It is very just.\n"+
		"Enter FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Look, here comes good Sir John. Give me your good\n"+
		"hand, give me your worship's good hand: by my\n"+
		"troth, you like well and bear your years very well:\n"+
		"welcome, good Sir John.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"I am glad to see you well, good Master Robert\n"+
		"Shallow: Master Surecard, as I think?\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"No, Sir John; it is my cousin Silence, in commission with me.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Good Master Silence, it well befits you should be of\n"+
		"the peace.\n"+
		"SILENCE\n"+
		"Your good-worship is welcome.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Fie! this is hot weather, gentlemen. Have you\n"+
		"provided me here half a dozen sufficient men?\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"Marry, have we, sir. Will you sit?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Let me see them, I beseech you.\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"Where's the roll? where's the roll? where's the\n"+
		"roll? Let me see, let me see, let me see. So, so:\n"+
		"yea, marry, sir: Ralph Mouldy! Let them appear as\n"+
		"I call; let them do so, let them do so. Let me\n"+
		"see; where is Mouldy?\n"+
		"MOULDY\n"+
		"Here, an't please you.\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"What think you, Sir John? a good-limbed fellow;\n"+
		"young, strong, and of good friends.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Is thy name Mouldy?\n"+
		"MOULDY\n"+
		"Yea, an't please you.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"'Tis the more time thou wert used.\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"Ha, ha, ha! most excellent, i' faith! Things that\n"+
		"are mouldy lack use: very singular good! in faith,\n"+
		"well said, Sir John, very well said.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Prick him.\n"+
		"MOULDY\n"+
		"I was pricked well enough before, an you could have\n"+
		"let me alone: my old dame will be undone now for\n"+
		"one to do her husbandry and her drudgery: you need\n"+
		"not to have pricked me; there are other men fitter\n"+
		"to go out than I.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Go to: peace, Mouldy; you shall go. Mouldy, it is\n"+
		"time you were spent.\n"+
		"MOULDY\n"+
		"Spent!\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"Peace, fellow, peace; stand aside: know you where\n"+
		"you are? For the other, Sir John: let me see:\n"+
		"Simon Shadow!\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Yea, marry, let me have him to sit under: he's like\n"+
		"to be a cold soldier.\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"Where's Shadow?\n"+
		"SHADOW\n"+
		"Here, sir.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Shadow, whose son art thou?\n"+
		"SHADOW\n"+
		"My mother's son, sir.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Thy mother's son! like enough, and thy father's\n"+
		"shadow: so the son of the female is the shadow of\n"+
		"the male: it is often so, indeed; but much of the\n"+
		"father's substance!\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"Do you like him, Sir John?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Shadow will serve for summer; prick him, for we have\n"+
		"a number of shadows to fill up the muster-book.\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"Thomas Wart!\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Where's he?\n"+
		"WART\n"+
		"Here, sir.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Is thy name Wart?\n"+
		"WART\n"+
		"Yea, sir.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Thou art a very ragged wart.\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"Shall I prick him down, Sir John?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"It were superfluous; for his apparel is built upon\n"+
		"his back and the whole frame stands upon pins:\n"+
		"prick him no more.\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"Ha, ha, ha! you can do it, sir; you can do it: I\n"+
		"commend you well. Francis Feeble!\n"+
		"FEEBLE\n"+
		"Here, sir.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"What trade art thou, Feeble?\n"+
		"FEEBLE\n"+
		"A woman's tailor, sir.\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"Shall I prick him, sir?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"You may: but if he had been a man's tailor, he'ld\n"+
		"ha' pricked you. Wilt thou make as many holes in\n"+
		"an enemy's battle as thou hast done in a woman's petticoat?\n"+
		"FEEBLE\n"+
		"I will do my good will, sir; you can have no more.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Well said, good woman's tailor! well said,\n"+
		"courageous Feeble! thou wilt be as valiant as the\n"+
		"wrathful dove or most magnanimous mouse. Prick the\n"+
		"woman's tailor: well, Master Shallow; deep, Master Shallow.\n"+
		"FEEBLE\n"+
		"I would Wart might have gone, sir.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"I would thou wert a man's tailor, that thou mightst\n"+
		"mend him and make him fit to go. I cannot put him\n"+
		"to a private soldier that is the leader of so many\n"+
		"thousands: let that suffice, most forcible Feeble.\n"+
		"FEEBLE\n"+
		"It shall suffice, sir.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"I am bound to thee, reverend Feeble. Who is next?\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"Peter Bullcalf o' the green!\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Yea, marry, let's see Bullcalf.\n"+
		"BULLCALF\n"+
		"Here, sir.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"'Fore God, a likely fellow! Come, prick me Bullcalf\n"+
		"till he roar again.\n"+
		"BULLCALF\n"+
		"O Lord! good my lord captain,--\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"What, dost thou roar before thou art pricked?\n"+
		"BULLCALF\n"+
		"O Lord, sir! I am a diseased man.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"What disease hast thou?\n"+
		"BULLCALF\n"+
		"A whoreson cold, sir, a cough, sir, which I caught\n"+
		"with ringing in the king's affairs upon his\n"+
		"coronation-day, sir.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Come, thou shalt go to the wars in a gown; we wilt\n"+
		"have away thy cold; and I will take such order that\n"+
		"my friends shall ring for thee. Is here all?\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"Here is two more called than your number, you must\n"+
		"have but four here, sir: and so, I pray you, go in\n"+
		"with me to dinner.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Come, I will go drink with you, but I cannot tarry\n"+
		"dinner. I am glad to see you, by my troth, Master Shallow.\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"O, Sir John, do you remember since we lay all night\n"+
		"in the windmill in Saint George's field?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"No more of that, good Master Shallow, no more of that.\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"Ha! 'twas a merry night. And is Jane Nightwork alive?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"She lives, Master Shallow.\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"She never could away with me.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Never, never; she would always say she could not\n"+
		"abide Master Shallow.\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"By the mass, I could anger her to the heart. She\n"+
		"was then a bona-roba. Doth she hold her own well?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Old, old, Master Shallow.\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"Nay, she must be old; she cannot choose but be old;\n"+
		"certain she's old; and had Robin Nightwork by old\n"+
		"Nightwork before I came to Clement's Inn.\n"+
		"SILENCE\n"+
		"That's fifty-five year ago.\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"Ha, cousin Silence, that thou hadst seen that that\n"+
		"this knight and I have seen! Ha, Sir John, said I well?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"We have heard the chimes at midnight, Master Shallow.\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"That we have, that we have, that we have; in faith,\n"+
		"Sir John, we have: our watch-word was 'Hem boys!'\n"+

		"I do not care; but rather, because I am unwilling,\n"+
		"and, for mine own part, have a desire to stay with\n"+

		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"Sir John, Sir John, do not yourself wrong: they are\n"+
		"your likeliest men, and I would have you served with the best.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Will you tell me, Master Shallow, how to choose a\n"+
		"man? Care I for the limb, the thewes, the stature,\n"+
		"bulk, and big assemblance of a man! Give me the\n"+
		"spirit, Master Shallow. Here's Wart; you see what a\n"+
		"ragged appearance it is; a' shall charge you and\n"+
		"discharge you with the motion of a pewterer's\n"+
		"hammer, come off and on swifter than he that gibbets\n"+
		"on the brewer's bucket. And this same half-faced\n"+
		"fellow, Shadow; give me this man: he presents no\n"+
		"mark to the enemy; the foeman may with as great aim\n"+
		"level at the edge of a penknife. And for a retreat;\n"+
		"how swiftly will this Feeble the woman's tailor run\n"+
		"off! O, give me the spare men, and spare me the\n"+
		"great ones. Put me a caliver into Wart's hand, Bardolph.\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Hold, Wart, traverse; thus, thus, thus.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Come, manage me your caliver. So: very well: go\n"+

		"tester for thee.\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"He is not his craft's master; he doth not do it\n"+

		"Clement's Inn--I was then Sir Dagonet in Arthur's\n"+
		"show,--there was a little quiver fellow, and a'\n"+
		"would manage you his piece thus; and a' would about\n"+

		"me of the wildness of his youth, and the feats he\n"+
		"hath done about Turnbull Street: and every third\n"+
		"word a lie, duer paid to the hearer than the Turk's\n"+
		"tribute. I do remember him at Clement's Inn like a\n"+
		"man made after supper of a cheese-paring: when a'\n"+
		"was naked, he was, for all the world, like a forked\n"+
		"radish, with a head fantastically carved upon it\n"+
		"with a knife: a' was so forlorn, that his\n"+
		"dimensions to any thick sight were invincible: a'\n"+
		"was the very genius of famine; yet lecherous as a\n"+
		"monkey, and the whores called him mandrake: a' came\n"+
		"ever in the rearward of the fashion, and sung those\n"+
		"tunes to the overscutched huswives that he heard the\n"+
		"carmen whistle, and swear they were his fancies or\n"+
		"his good-nights. And now is this Vice's dagger\n"+
		"become a squire, and talks as familiarly of John a\n"+
		"Gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him; and\n"+
		"I'll be sworn a' ne'er saw him but once in the\n"+
		"Tilt-yard; and then he burst his head for crowding\n"+
		"among the marshal's men. I saw it, and told John a\n"+
		"Gaunt he beat his own name; for you might have\n"+
		"thrust him and all his apparel into an eel-skin; the\n"+
		"case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him, a\n"+
		"court: and now has he land and beefs. Well, I'll\n"+
		"be acquainted with him, if I return; and it shall\n"+
		"go hard but I will make him a philosopher's two\n"+
		"stones to me: if the young dace be a bait for the\n"+
		"old pike, I see no reason in the law of nature but I\n"+
		"may snap at him. Let time shape, and there an end.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"ACT IV\n"+
		"SCENE I. Yorkshire. Gaultree Forest.\n"+
		"Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, MOWBRAY, LORD HASTINGS, and others\n"+
		"ARCHBISHOP OF YORK\n"+
		"What is this forest call'd?\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"'Tis Gaultree Forest, an't shall please your grace.\n"+
		"ARCHBISHOP OF YORK\n"+
		"Here stand, my lords; and send discoverers forth\n"+
		"To know the numbers of our enemies.\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"We have sent forth already.\n"+
		"ARCHBISHOP OF YORK\n"+
		"'Tis well done.\n"+
		"My friends and brethren in these great affairs,\n"+
		"I must acquaint you that I have received\n"+
		"New-dated letters from Northumberland;\n"+
		"Their cold intent, tenor and substance, thus:\n"+
		"Here doth he wish his person, with such powers\n"+
		"As might hold sortance with his quality,\n"+
		"The which he could not levy; whereupon\n"+
		"He is retired, to ripe his growing fortunes,\n"+
		"To Scotland: and concludes in hearty prayers\n"+
		"That your attempts may overlive the hazard\n"+
		"And fearful melting of their opposite.\n"+
		"MOWBRAY\n"+
		"Thus do the hopes we have in him touch ground\n"+
		"And dash themselves to pieces.\n"+
		"Enter a Messenger\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"Now, what news?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"West of this forest, scarcely off a mile,\n"+
		"In goodly form comes on the enemy;\n"+
		"And, by the ground they hide, I judge their number\n"+
		"Upon or near the rate of thirty thousand.\n"+
		"MOWBRAY\n"+
		"The just proportion that we gave them out\n"+
		"Let us sway on and face them in the field.\n"+
		"ARCHBISHOP OF YORK\n"+
		"What well-appointed leader fronts us here?\n"+
		"Enter WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"MOWBRAY\n"+
		"I think it is my Lord of Westmoreland.\n"+
		"WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"Health and fair greeting from our general,\n"+
		"The prince, Lord John and Duke of Lancaster.\n"+
		"ARCHBISHOP OF YORK\n"+
		"Say on, my Lord of Westmoreland, in peace:\n"+
		"What doth concern your coming?\n"+
		"WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"Then, my lord,\n"+
		"Unto your grace do I in chief address\n"+
		"The substance of my speech. If that rebellion\n"+
		"Came like itself, in base and abject routs,\n"+
		"Led on by bloody youth, guarded with rags,\n"+
		"And countenanced by boys and beggary,\n"+
		"I say, if damn'd commotion so appear'd,\n"+
		"In his true, native and most proper shape,\n"+
		"You, reverend father, and these noble lords\n"+
		"Had not been here, to dress the ugly form\n"+
		"Of base and bloody insurrection\n"+
		"With your fair honours. You, lord archbishop,\n"+
		"Whose see is by a civil peace maintained,\n"+
		"Whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touch'd,\n"+
		"Whose learning and good letters peace hath tutor'd,\n"+
		"Whose white investments figure innocence,\n"+
		"The dove and very blessed spirit of peace,\n"+
		"Wherefore do you so ill translate ourself\n"+
		"Out of the speech of peace that bears such grace,\n"+
		"Into the harsh and boisterous tongue of war;\n"+
		"Turning your books to graves, your ink to blood,\n"+
		"Your pens to lances and your tongue divine\n"+
		"To a trumpet and a point of war?\n"+
		"ARCHBISHOP OF YORK\n"+
		"Wherefore do I this? so the question stands.\n"+
		"Briefly to this end: we are all diseased,\n"+
		"And with our surfeiting and wanton hours\n"+
		"Have brought ourselves into a burning fever,\n"+
		"And we must bleed for it; of which disease\n"+
		"Our late king, Richard, being infected, died.\n"+
		"But, my most noble Lord of Westmoreland,\n"+
		"I take not on me here as a physician,\n"+
		"Nor do I as an enemy to peace\n"+
		"Troop in the throngs of military men;\n"+
		"But rather show awhile like fearful war,\n"+
		"To diet rank minds sick of happiness\n"+
		"And purge the obstructions which begin to stop\n"+
		"Our very veins of life. Hear me more plainly.\n"+
		"I have in equal balance justly weigh'd\n"+
		"What wrongs our arms may do, what wrongs we suffer,\n"+
		"And find our griefs heavier than our offences.\n"+
		"We see which way the stream of time doth run,\n"+
		"And are enforced from our most quiet there\n"+
		"By the rough torrent of occasion;\n"+
		"And have the summary of all our griefs,\n"+
		"When time shall serve, to show in articles;\n"+
		"Which long ere this we offer'd to the king,\n"+
		"And might by no suit gain our audience:\n"+
		"When we are wrong'd and would unfold our griefs,\n"+
		"We are denied access unto his person\n"+
		"Even by those men that most have done us wrong.\n"+
		"The dangers of the days but newly gone,\n"+
		"Whose memory is written on the earth\n"+
		"With yet appearing blood, and the examples\n"+
		"Of every minute's instance, present now,\n"+
		"Hath put us in these ill-beseeming arms,\n"+
		"Not to break peace or any branch of it,\n"+
		"But to establish here a peace indeed,\n"+
		"Concurring both in name and quality.\n"+
		"WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"When ever yet was your appeal denied?\n"+
		"Wherein have you been galled by the king?\n"+
		"What peer hath been suborn'd to grate on you,\n"+
		"That you should seal this lawless bloody book\n"+
		"Of forged rebellion with a seal divine\n"+
		"And consecrate commotion's bitter edge?\n"+
		"ARCHBISHOP OF YORK\n"+
		"My brother general, the commonwealth,\n"+
		"To brother born an household cruelty,\n"+
		"I make my quarrel in particular.\n"+
		"WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"There is no need of any such redress;\n"+
		"Or if there were, it not belongs to you.\n"+
		"MOWBRAY\n"+
		"Why not to him in part, and to us all\n"+
		"That feel the bruises of the days before,\n"+
		"And suffer the condition of these times\n"+
		"To lay a heavy and unequal hand\n"+
		"Upon our honours?\n"+
		"WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"O, my good Lord Mowbray,\n"+
		"Construe the times to their necessities,\n"+
		"And you shall say indeed, it is the time,\n"+
		"And not the king, that doth you injuries.\n"+
		"Yet for your part, it not appears to me\n"+
		"Either from the king or in the present time\n"+
		"That you should have an inch of any ground\n"+
		"To build a grief on: were you not restored\n"+
		"To all the Duke of Norfolk's signories,\n"+
		"Your noble and right well remember'd father's?\n"+
		"MOWBRAY\n"+
		"What thing, in honour, had my father lost,\n"+
		"That need to be revived and breathed in me?\n"+
		"The king that loved him, as the state stood then,\n"+
		"Was force perforce compell'd to banish him:\n"+
		"And then that Harry Bolingbroke and he,\n"+
		"Being mounted and both roused in their seats,\n"+
		"Their neighing coursers daring of the spur,\n"+
		"Their armed staves in charge, their beavers down,\n"+
		"Their eyes of fire sparking through sights of steel\n"+
		"And the loud trumpet blowing them together,\n"+
		"Then, then, when there was nothing could have stay'd\n"+
		"My father from the breast of Bolingbroke,\n"+
		"O when the king did throw his warder down,\n"+
		"His own life hung upon the staff he threw;\n"+
		"Then threw he down himself and all their lives\n"+
		"That by indictment and by dint of sword\n"+
		"Have since miscarried under Bolingbroke.\n"+
		"WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"You speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not what.\n"+
		"The Earl of Hereford was reputed then\n"+
		"In England the most valiant gentlemen:\n"+
		"Who knows on whom fortune would then have smiled?\n"+
		"But if your father had been victor there,\n"+
		"He ne'er had borne it out of Coventry:\n"+
		"For all the country in a general voice\n"+
		"Cried hate upon him; and all their prayers and love\n"+
		"Were set on Hereford, whom they doted on\n"+
		"And bless'd and graced indeed, more than the king.\n"+
		"But this is mere digression from my purpose.\n"+
		"Here come I from our princely general\n"+
		"To know your griefs; to tell you from his grace\n"+
		"That he will give you audience; and wherein\n"+
		"It shall appear that your demands are just,\n"+
		"You shall enjoy them, every thing set off\n"+
		"That might so much as think you enemies.\n"+
		"MOWBRAY\n"+
		"But he hath forced us to compel this offer;\n"+
		"And it proceeds from policy, not love.\n"+
		"WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"Mowbray, you overween to take it so;\n"+
		"This offer comes from mercy, not from fear:\n"+
		"For, lo! within a ken our army lies,\n"+
		"Upon mine honour, all too confident\n"+
		"To give admittance to a thought of fear.\n"+
		"Our battle is more full of names than yours,\n"+
		"Our men more perfect in the use of arms,\n"+
		"Our armour all as strong, our cause the best;\n"+
		"Then reason will our heart should be as good\n"+
		"Say you not then our offer is compell'd.\n"+
		"MOWBRAY\n"+
		"Well, by my will we shall admit no parley.\n"+
		"WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"That argues but the shame of your offence:\n"+
		"A rotten case abides no handling.\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"Hath the Prince John a full commission,\n"+
		"In very ample virtue of his father,\n"+
		"To hear and absolutely to determine\n"+
		"Of what conditions we shall stand upon?\n"+
		"WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"That is intended in the general's name:\n"+
		"I muse you make so slight a question.\n"+
		"ARCHBISHOP OF YORK\n"+
		"Then take, my Lord of Westmoreland, this schedule,\n"+
		"For this contains our general grievances:\n"+
		"Each several article herein redress'd,\n"+
		"All members of our cause, both here and hence,\n"+
		"That are insinew'd to this action,\n"+
		"Acquitted by a true substantial form\n"+
		"And present execution of our wills\n"+
		"To us and to our purposes confined,\n"+
		"We come within our awful banks again\n"+
		"And knit our powers to the arm of peace.\n"+
		"WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"This will I show the general. Please you, lords,\n"+
		"In sight of both our battles we may meet;\n"+
		"And either end in peace, which God so frame!\n"+
		"Or to the place of difference call the swords\n"+
		"Which must decide it.\n"+
		"ARCHBISHOP OF YORK\n"+
		"My lord, we will do so.\n"+
		"Exit WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"MOWBRAY\n"+
		"There is a thing within my bosom tells me\n"+
		"That no conditions of our peace can stand.\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"Fear you not that: if we can make our peace\n"+
		"Upon such large terms and so absolute\n"+
		"As our conditions shall consist upon,\n"+
		"Our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains.\n"+
		"MOWBRAY\n"+
		"Yea, but our valuation shall be such\n"+
		"That every slight and false-derived cause,\n"+
		"Yea, every idle, nice and wanton reason\n"+
		"Shall to the king taste of this action;\n"+
		"That, were our royal faiths martyrs in love,\n"+
		"We shall be winnow'd with so rough a wind\n"+
		"That even our corn shall seem as light as chaff\n"+
		"And good from bad find no partition.\n"+
		"ARCHBISHOP OF YORK\n"+
		"No, no, my lord. Note this; the king is weary\n"+
		"Of dainty and such picking grievances:\n"+
		"For he hath found to end one doubt by death\n"+
		"Revives two greater in the heirs of life,\n"+
		"And therefore will he wipe his tables clean\n"+
		"And keep no tell-tale to his memory\n"+
		"That may repeat and history his loss\n"+
		"To new remembrance; for full well he knows\n"+
		"He cannot so precisely weed this land\n"+
		"As his misdoubts present occasion:\n"+
		"His foes are so enrooted with his friends\n"+
		"That, plucking to unfix an enemy,\n"+
		"He doth unfasten so and shake a friend:\n"+
		"So that this land, like an offensive wife\n"+
		"That hath enraged him on to offer strokes,\n"+
		"As he is striking, holds his infant up\n"+
		"And hangs resolved correction in the arm\n"+
		"That was uprear'd to execution.\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"Besides, the king hath wasted all his rods\n"+
		"On late offenders, that he now doth lack\n"+
		"The very instruments of chastisement:\n"+
		"So that his power, like to a fangless lion,\n"+
		"May offer, but not hold.\n"+
		"ARCHBISHOP OF YORK\n"+
		"'Tis very true:\n"+
		"And therefore be assured, my good lord marshal,\n"+
		"If we do now make our atonement well,\n"+
		"Our peace will, like a broken limb united,\n"+
		"Grow stronger for the breaking.\n"+
		"MOWBRAY\n"+
		"Be it so.\n"+
		"Here is return'd my Lord of Westmoreland.\n"+
		"Re-enter WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"The prince is here at hand: pleaseth your lordship\n"+
		"To meet his grace just distance 'tween our armies.\n"+
		"MOWBRAY\n"+
		"Your grace of York, in God's name then, set forward.\n"+
		"ARCHBISHOP OF YORK\n"+
		"Before, and greet his grace: my lord, we come.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. Another part of the forest.\n"+
		"Enter, from one side, MOWBRAY, attended; afterwards the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, HASTINGS, and others: from the other side, Prince John of LANCASTER, and WESTMORELAND; Officers, and others with them\n"+
		"LANCASTER\n"+
		"You are well encounter'd here, my cousin Mowbray:\n"+
		"Good day to you, gentle lord archbishop;\n"+
		"And so to you, Lord Hastings, and to all.\n"+
		"My Lord of York, it better show'd with you\n"+
		"When that your flock, assembled by the bell,\n"+
		"Encircled you to hear with reverence\n"+
		"Your exposition on the holy text\n"+
		"Than now to see you here an iron man,\n"+
		"Cheering a rout of rebels with your drum,\n"+
		"Turning the word to sword and life to death.\n"+
		"That man that sits within a monarch's heart,\n"+
		"And ripens in the sunshine of his favour,\n"+
		"Would he abuse the countenance of the king,\n"+
		"Alack, what mischiefs might he set abrooch\n"+
		"In shadow of such greatness! With you, lord bishop,\n"+
		"It is even so. Who hath not heard it spoken\n"+
		"How deep you were within the books of God?\n"+
		"To us the speaker in his parliament;\n"+
		"To us the imagined voice of God himself;\n"+
		"The very opener and intelligencer\n"+
		"Between the grace, the sanctities of heaven\n"+
		"And our dull workings. O, who shall believe\n"+
		"But you misuse the reverence of your place,\n"+
		"Employ the countenance and grace of heaven,\n"+
		"As a false favourite doth his prince's name,\n"+
		"In deeds dishonourable? You have ta'en up,\n"+
		"Under the counterfeited zeal of God,\n"+
		"The subjects of his substitute, my father,\n"+
		"And both against the peace of heaven and him\n"+
		"Have here up-swarm'd them.\n"+
		"ARCHBISHOP OF YORK\n"+
		"Good my Lord of Lancaster,\n"+
		"I am not here against your father's peace;\n"+
		"But, as I told my lord of Westmoreland,\n"+
		"The time misorder'd doth, in common sense,\n"+
		"Crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form,\n"+
		"To hold our safety up. I sent your grace\n"+
		"The parcels and particulars of our grief,\n"+
		"The which hath been with scorn shoved from the court,\n"+
		"Whereon this Hydra son of war is born;\n"+
		"Whose dangerous eyes may well be charm'd asleep\n"+
		"With grant of our most just and right desires,\n"+
		"And true obedience, of this madness cured,\n"+
		"Stoop tamely to the foot of majesty.\n"+
		"MOWBRAY\n"+
		"If not, we ready are to try our fortunes\n"+
		"To the last man.\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"And though we here fall down,\n"+
		"We have supplies to second our attempt:\n"+
		"If they miscarry, theirs shall second them;\n"+
		"And so success of mischief shall be born\n"+
		"And heir from heir shall hold this quarrel up\n"+
		"Whiles England shall have generation.\n"+
		"LANCASTER\n"+
		"You are too shallow, Hastings, much too shallow,\n"+
		"To sound the bottom of the after-times.\n"+
		"WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"Pleaseth your grace to answer them directly\n"+
		"How far forth you do like their articles.\n"+
		"LANCASTER\n"+
		"I like them all, and do allow them well,\n"+
		"And swear here, by the honour of my blood,\n"+
		"My father's purposes have been mistook,\n"+
		"And some about him have too lavishly\n"+
		"Wrested his meaning and authority.\n"+
		"My lord, these griefs shall be with speed redress'd;\n"+
		"Upon my soul, they shall. If this may please you,\n"+
		"Discharge your powers unto their several counties,\n"+
		"As we will ours: and here between the armies\n"+
		"Let's drink together friendly and embrace,\n"+
		"That all their eyes may bear those tokens home\n"+
		"Of our restored love and amity.\n"+
		"ARCHBISHOP OF YORK\n"+
		"I take your princely word for these redresses.\n"+
		"LANCASTER\n"+
		"I give it you, and will maintain my word:\n"+
		"And thereupon I drink unto your grace.\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"Go, captain, and deliver to the army\n"+
		"This news of peace: let them have pay, and part:\n"+
		"I know it will well please them. Hie thee, captain.\n"+
		"Exit Officer\n"+
		"ARCHBISHOP OF YORK\n"+
		"To you, my noble Lord of Westmoreland.\n"+
		"WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"I pledge your grace; and, if you knew what pains\n"+
		"I have bestow'd to breed this present peace,\n"+
		"You would drink freely: but my love to ye\n"+
		"Shall show itself more openly hereafter.\n"+
		"ARCHBISHOP OF YORK\n"+
		"I do not doubt you.\n"+
		"WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"I am glad of it.\n"+
		"Health to my lord and gentle cousin, Mowbray.\n"+
		"MOWBRAY\n"+
		"You wish me health in very happy season;\n"+
		"For I am, on the sudden, something ill.\n"+
		"ARCHBISHOP OF YORK\n"+
		"Against ill chances men are ever merry;\n"+
		"But heaviness foreruns the good event.\n"+
		"WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"Therefore be merry, coz; since sudden sorrow\n"+
		"Serves to say thus, 'some good thing comes\n"+
		"to-morrow.'\n"+
		"ARCHBISHOP OF YORK\n"+
		"Believe me, I am passing light in spirit.\n"+
		"MOWBRAY\n"+
		"So much the worse, if your own rule be true.\n"+
		"Shouts within\n"+
		"LANCASTER\n"+
		"The word of peace is render'd: hark, how they shout!\n"+
		"MOWBRAY\n"+
		"This had been cheerful after victory.\n"+
		"ARCHBISHOP OF YORK\n"+
		"A peace is of the nature of a conquest;\n"+
		"For then both parties nobly are subdued,\n"+
		"And neither party loser.\n"+
		"LANCASTER\n"+
		"Go, my lord,\n"+
		"And let our army be discharged too.\n"+
		"Exit WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"And, good my lord, so please you, let our trains\n"+
		"March, by us, that we may peruse the men\n"+
		"We should have coped withal.\n"+
		"ARCHBISHOP OF YORK\n"+
		"Go, good Lord Hastings,\n"+
		"And, ere they be dismissed, let them march by.\n"+
		"Exit HASTINGS\n"+
		"LANCASTER\n"+
		"I trust, lords, we shall lie to-night together.\n"+
		"Re-enter WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"Now, cousin, wherefore stands our army still?\n"+
		"WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"The leaders, having charge from you to stand,\n"+
		"Will not go off until they hear you speak.\n"+
		"LANCASTER\n"+
		"They know their duties.\n"+
		"Re-enter HASTINGS\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"My lord, our army is dispersed already;\n"+
		"Like youthful steers unyoked, they take their courses\n"+
		"East, west, north, south; or, like a school broke up,\n"+
		"Each hurries toward his home and sporting-place.\n"+
		"WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"Good tidings, my Lord Hastings; for the which\n"+
		"I do arrest thee, traitor, of high treason:\n"+
		"And you, lord archbishop, and you, Lord Mowbray,\n"+
		"Of capitol treason I attach you both.\n"+
		"MOWBRAY\n"+
		"Is this proceeding just and honourable?\n"+
		"WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"Is your assembly so?\n"+
		"ARCHBISHOP OF YORK\n"+
		"Will you thus break your faith?\n"+
		"LANCASTER\n"+
		"I pawn'd thee none:\n"+
		"I promised you redress of these same grievances\n"+
		"Whereof you did complain; which, by mine honour,\n"+
		"I will perform with a most Christian care.\n"+
		"But for you, rebels, look to taste the due\n"+
		"Meet for rebellion and such acts as yours.\n"+
		"Most shallowly did you these arms commence,\n"+
		"Fondly brought here and foolishly sent hence.\n"+
		"Strike up our drums, pursue the scatter'd stray:\n"+
		"God, and not we, hath safely fought to-day.\n"+
		"Some guard these traitors to the block of death,\n"+
		"Treason's true bed and yielder up of breath.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. Another part of the forest.\n"+
		"Alarum. Excursions. Enter FALSTAFF and COLEVILE, meeting\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"What's your name, sir? of what condition are you,\n"+
		"and of what place, I pray?\n"+
		"COLEVILE\n"+
		"I am a knight, sir, and my name is Colevile of the dale.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Well, then, Colevile is your name, a knight is your\n"+
		"degree, and your place the dale: Colevile shall be\n"+
		"still your name, a traitor your degree, and the\n"+
		"dungeon your place, a place deep enough; so shall\n"+
		"you be still Colevile of the dale.\n"+
		"COLEVILE\n"+
		"Are not you Sir John Falstaff?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"As good a man as he, sir, whoe'er I am. Do ye\n"+
		"yield, sir? or shall I sweat for you? if I do\n"+
		"sweat, they are the drops of thy lovers, and they\n"+
		"weep for thy death: therefore rouse up fear and\n"+
		"trembling, and do observance to my mercy.\n"+
		"COLEVILE\n"+
		"I think you are Sir John Falstaff, and in that\n"+
		"thought yield me.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"I have a whole school of tongues in this belly of\n"+
		"mine, and not a tongue of them all speaks any other\n"+
		"word but my name. An I had but a belly of any\n"+
		"indifference, I were simply the most active fellow\n"+
		"in Europe: my womb, my womb, my womb, undoes me.\n"+
		"Here comes our general.\n"+
		"Enter PRINCE JOHN OF LANCASTER, WESTMORELAND, BLUNT, and others\n"+
		"LANCASTER\n"+
		"The heat is past; follow no further now:\n"+
		"Call in the powers, good cousin Westmoreland.\n"+
		"Exit WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"Now, Falstaff, where have you been all this while?\n"+
		"When every thing is ended, then you come:\n"+
		"These tardy tricks of yours will, on my life,\n"+
		"One time or other break some gallows' back.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"I would be sorry, my lord, but it should be thus: I\n"+
		"never knew yet but rebuke and cheque was the reward\n"+
		"of valour. Do you think me a swallow, an arrow, or a\n"+
		"bullet? have I, in my poor and old motion, the\n"+
		"expedition of thought? I have speeded hither with\n"+
		"the very extremest inch of possibility; I have\n"+
		"foundered nine score and odd posts: and here,\n"+
		"travel-tainted as I am, have in my pure and\n"+
		"immaculate valour, taken Sir John Colevile of the\n"+
		"dale, a most furious knight and valorous enemy.\n"+
		"But what of that? he saw me, and yielded; that I\n"+
		"may justly say, with the hook-nosed fellow of Rome,\n"+
		"'I came, saw, and overcame.'\n"+
		"LANCASTER\n"+
		"It was more of his courtesy than your deserving.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"I know not: here he is, and here I yield him: and\n"+
		"I beseech your grace, let it be booked with the\n"+
		"rest of this day's deeds; or, by the Lord, I will\n"+
		"have it in a particular ballad else, with mine own\n"+
		"picture on the top on't, Colevile kissing my foot:\n"+
		"to the which course if I be enforced, if you do not\n"+
		"all show like gilt twopences to me, and I in the\n"+
		"clear sky of fame o'ershine you as much as the full\n"+
		"moon doth the cinders of the element, which show\n"+
		"like pins' heads to her, believe not the word of\n"+
		"the noble: therefore let me have right, and let\n"+
		"desert mount.\n"+
		"LANCASTER\n"+
		"Thine's too heavy to mount.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Let it shine, then.\n"+
		"LANCASTER\n"+
		"Thine's too thick to shine.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Let it do something, my good lord, that may do me\n"+
		"good, and call it what you will.\n"+
		"LANCASTER\n"+
		"Is thy name Colevile?\n"+
		"COLEVILE\n"+
		"It is, my lord.\n"+
		"LANCASTER\n"+
		"A famous rebel art thou, Colevile.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"And a famous true subject took him.\n"+
		"COLEVILE\n"+
		"I am, my lord, but as my betters are\n"+
		"That led me hither: had they been ruled by me,\n"+
		"You should have won them dearer than you have.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"I know not how they sold themselves: but thou, like\n"+
		"a kind fellow, gavest thyself away gratis; and I\n"+
		"thank thee for thee.\n"+
		"Re-enter WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"LANCASTER\n"+
		"Now, have you left pursuit?\n"+
		"WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"Retreat is made and execution stay'd.\n"+
		"LANCASTER\n"+
		"Send Colevile with his confederates\n"+
		"To York, to present execution:\n"+
		"Blunt, lead him hence; and see you guard him sure.\n"+
		"Exeunt BLUNT and others with COLEVILE\n"+
		"And now dispatch we toward the court, my lords:\n"+
		"I hear the king my father is sore sick:\n"+
		"Our news shall go before us to his majesty,\n"+
		"Which, cousin, you shall bear to comfort him,\n"+
		"And we with sober speed will follow you.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"My lord, I beseech you, give me leave to go\n"+
		"Through Gloucestershire: and, when you come to court,\n"+
		"Stand my good lord, pray, in your good report.\n"+
		"LANCASTER\n"+
		"Fare you well, Falstaff: I, in my condition,\n"+
		"Shall better speak of you than you deserve.\n"+
		"Exeunt all but Falstaff\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"I would you had but the wit: 'twere better than\n"+
		"your dukedom. Good faith, this same young sober-\n"+
		"blooded boy doth not love me; nor a man cannot make\n"+
		"him laugh; but that's no marvel, he drinks no wine.\n"+
		"There's never none of these demure boys come to any\n"+
		"proof; for thin drink doth so over-cool their blood,\n"+
		"and making many fish-meals, that they fall into a\n"+
		"kind of male green-sickness; and then when they\n"+
		"marry, they get wenches: they are generally fools\n"+
		"and cowards; which some of us should be too, but for\n"+
		"inflammation. A good sherris sack hath a two-fold\n"+
		"operation in it. It ascends me into the brain;\n"+
		"dries me there all the foolish and dull and curdy\n"+
		"vapours which environ it; makes it apprehensive,\n"+
		"quick, forgetive, full of nimble fiery and\n"+
		"delectable shapes, which, delivered o'er to the\n"+
		"voice, the tongue, which is the birth, becomes\n"+
		"excellent wit. The second property of your\n"+
		"excellent sherris is, the warming of the blood;\n"+
		"which, before cold and settled, left the liver\n"+
		"white and pale, which is the badge of pusillanimity\n"+
		"and cowardice; but the sherris warms it and makes\n"+
		"it course from the inwards to the parts extreme:\n"+
		"it illumineth the face, which as a beacon gives\n"+
		"warning to all the rest of this little kingdom,\n"+
		"man, to arm; and then the vital commoners and\n"+
		"inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain,\n"+
		"the heart, who, great and puffed up with this\n"+
		"retinue, doth any deed of courage; and this valour\n"+
		"comes of sherris. So that skill in the weapon is\n"+
		"nothing without sack, for that sets it a-work; and\n"+
		"learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil, till\n"+
		"sack commences it and sets it in act and use.\n"+
		"Hereof comes it that Prince Harry is valiant; for\n"+
		"the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his\n"+
		"father, he hath, like lean, sterile and bare land,\n"+
		"manured, husbanded and tilled with excellent\n"+
		"endeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile\n"+
		"sherris, that he is become very hot and valiant. If\n"+
		"I had a thousand sons, the first humane principle I\n"+
		"would teach them should be, to forswear thin\n"+
		"potations and to addict themselves to sack.\n"+
		"Enter BARDOLPH\n"+
		"How now Bardolph?\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"The army is discharged all and gone.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Let them go. I'll through Gloucestershire; and\n"+
		"there will I visit Master Robert Shallow, esquire:\n"+
		"I have him already tempering between my finger and\n"+
		"my thumb, and shortly will I seal with him. Come away.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV. Westminster. The Jerusalem Chamber.\n"+
		"Enter KING HENRY IV, the Princes Thomas of CLARENCE and Humphrey of GLOUCESTER, WARWICK, and others\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"Now, lords, if God doth give successful end\n"+
		"To this debate that bleedeth at our doors,\n"+
		"We will our youth lead on to higher fields\n"+
		"And draw no swords but what are sanctified.\n"+
		"Our navy is address'd, our power collected,\n"+
		"Our substitutes in absence well invested,\n"+
		"And every thing lies level to our wish:\n"+
		"Only, we want a little personal strength;\n"+
		"And pause us, till these rebels, now afoot,\n"+
		"Come underneath the yoke of government.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Both which we doubt not but your majesty\n"+
		"Shall soon enjoy.\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"Humphrey, my son of Gloucester,\n"+
		"Where is the prince your brother?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"I think he's gone to hunt, my lord, at Windsor.\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"And how accompanied?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"I do not know, my lord.\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"Is not his brother, Thomas of Clarence, with him?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"No, my good lord; he is in presence here.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"What would my lord and father?\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"Nothing but well to thee, Thomas of Clarence.\n"+
		"How chance thou art not with the prince thy brother?\n"+
		"He loves thee, and thou dost neglect him, Thomas;\n"+
		"Thou hast a better place in his affection\n"+
		"Than all thy brothers: cherish it, my boy,\n"+
		"And noble offices thou mayst effect\n"+
		"Of mediation, after I am dead,\n"+
		"Between his greatness and thy other brethren:\n"+
		"Therefore omit him not; blunt not his love,\n"+
		"Nor lose the good advantage of his grace\n"+
		"By seeming cold or careless of his will;\n"+
		"For he is gracious, if he be observed:\n"+
		"He hath a tear for pity and a hand\n"+
		"Open as day for melting charity:\n"+
		"Yet notwithstanding, being incensed, he's flint,\n"+
		"As humorous as winter and as sudden\n"+
		"As flaws congealed in the spring of day.\n"+
		"His temper, therefore, must be well observed:\n"+
		"Chide him for faults, and do it reverently,\n"+
		"When thou perceive his blood inclined to mirth;\n"+
		"But, being moody, give him line and scope,\n"+
		"Till that his passions, like a whale on ground,\n"+
		"Confound themselves with working. Learn this, Thomas,\n"+
		"And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends,\n"+
		"A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in,\n"+
		"That the united vessel of their blood,\n"+
		"Mingled with venom of suggestion--\n"+
		"As, force perforce, the age will pour it in--\n"+
		"Shall never leak, though it do work as strong\n"+
		"As aconitum or rash gunpowder.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"I shall observe him with all care and love.\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"Why art thou not at Windsor with him, Thomas?\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"He is not there to-day; he dines in London.\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"And how accompanied? canst thou tell that?\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"With Poins, and other his continual followers.\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"Most subject is the fattest soil to weeds;\n"+
		"And he, the noble image of my youth,\n"+
		"Is overspread with them: therefore my grief\n"+
		"Stretches itself beyond the hour of death:\n"+
		"The blood weeps from my heart when I do shape\n"+
		"In forms imaginary the unguided days\n"+
		"And rotten times that you shall look upon\n"+
		"When I am sleeping with my ancestors.\n"+
		"For when his headstrong riot hath no curb,\n"+
		"When rage and hot blood are his counsellors,\n"+
		"When means and lavish manners meet together,\n"+
		"O, with what wings shall his affections fly\n"+
		"Towards fronting peril and opposed decay!\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"My gracious lord, you look beyond him quite:\n"+
		"The prince but studies his companions\n"+
		"Like a strange tongue, wherein, to gain the language,\n"+
		"'Tis needful that the most immodest word\n"+
		"Be look'd upon and learn'd; which once attain'd,\n"+
		"Your highness knows, comes to no further use\n"+
		"But to be known and hated. So, like gross terms,\n"+
		"The prince will in the perfectness of time\n"+
		"Cast off his followers; and their memory\n"+
		"Shall as a pattern or a measure live,\n"+
		"By which his grace must mete the lives of others,\n"+
		"Turning past evils to advantages.\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"'Tis seldom when the bee doth leave her comb\n"+
		"In the dead carrion.\n"+
		"Enter WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"Who's here? Westmoreland?\n"+
		"WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"Health to my sovereign, and new happiness\n"+
		"Added to that that I am to deliver!\n"+
		"Prince John your son doth kiss your grace's hand:\n"+
		"Mowbray, the Bishop Scroop, Hastings and all\n"+
		"Are brought to the correction of your law;\n"+
		"There is not now a rebel's sword unsheath'd\n"+
		"But peace puts forth her olive every where.\n"+
		"The manner how this action hath been borne\n"+
		"Here at more leisure may your highness read,\n"+
		"With every course in his particular.\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"O Westmoreland, thou art a summer bird,\n"+
		"Which ever in the haunch of winter sings\n"+
		"The lifting up of day.\n"+
		"Enter HARCOURT\n"+
		"Look, here's more news.\n"+
		"HARCOURT\n"+
		"From enemies heaven keep your majesty;\n"+
		"And, when they stand against you, may they fall\n"+
		"As those that I am come to tell you of!\n"+
		"The Earl Northumberland and the Lord Bardolph,\n"+
		"With a great power of English and of Scots\n"+
		"Are by the sheriff of Yorkshire overthrown:\n"+
		"The manner and true order of the fight\n"+
		"This packet, please it you, contains at large.\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"And wherefore should these good news make me sick?\n"+
		"Will fortune never come with both hands full,\n"+
		"But write her fair words still in foulest letters?\n"+
		"She either gives a stomach and no food;\n"+
		"Such are the poor, in health; or else a feast\n"+
		"And takes away the stomach; such are the rich,\n"+
		"That have abundance and enjoy it not.\n"+
		"I should rejoice now at this happy news;\n"+
		"And now my sight fails, and my brain is giddy:\n"+
		"O me! come near me; now I am much ill.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Comfort, your majesty!\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"O my royal father!\n"+
		"WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"My sovereign lord, cheer up yourself, look up.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Be patient, princes; you do know, these fits\n"+
		"Are with his highness very ordinary.\n"+
		"Stand from him. Give him air; he'll straight be well.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"No, no, he cannot long hold out these pangs:\n"+
		"The incessant care and labour of his mind\n"+
		"Hath wrought the mure that should confine it in\n"+
		"So thin that life looks through and will break out.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"The people fear me; for they do observe\n"+
		"Unfather'd heirs and loathly births of nature:\n"+
		"The seasons change their manners, as the year\n"+
		"Had found some months asleep and leap'd them over.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"The river hath thrice flow'd, no ebb between;\n"+
		"And the old folk, time's doting chronicles,\n"+
		"Say it did so a little time before\n"+
		"That our great-grandsire, Edward, sick'd and died.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Speak lower, princes, for the king recovers.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"This apoplexy will certain be his end.\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"I pray you, take me up, and bear me hence\n"+
		"Into some other chamber: softly, pray.\n"+
		"SCENE V. Another chamber.\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV lying on a bed: CLARENCE, GLOUCESTER, WARWICK, and others in attendance\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"Let there be no noise made, my gentle friends;\n"+
		"Unless some dull and favourable hand\n"+
		"Will whisper music to my weary spirit.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Call for the music in the other room.\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"Set me the crown upon my pillow here.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"His eye is hollow, and he changes much.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Less noise, less noise!\n"+
		"Enter PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Who saw the Duke of Clarence?\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"I am here, brother, full of heaviness.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"How now! rain within doors, and none abroad!\n"+
		"How doth the king?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Exceeding ill.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Heard he the good news yet?\n"+
		"Tell it him.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"He alter'd much upon the hearing it.\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"If he be sick with joy, he'll recover without physic.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Not so much noise, my lords: sweet prince,\n"+
		"speak low;\n"+
		"The king your father is disposed to sleep.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"Let us withdraw into the other room.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Will't please your grace to go along with us?\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"No; I will sit and watch here by the king.\n"+
		"Exeunt all but PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Why doth the crown lie there upon his pillow,\n"+
		"Being so troublesome a bedfellow?\n"+
		"O polish'd perturbation! golden care!\n"+
		"That keep'st the ports of slumber open wide\n"+
		"To many a watchful night! sleep with it now!\n"+
		"Yet not so sound and half so deeply sweet\n"+
		"As he whose brow with homely biggen bound\n"+
		"Snores out the watch of night. O majesty!\n"+
		"When thou dost pinch thy bearer, thou dost sit\n"+
		"Like a rich armour worn in heat of day,\n"+
		"That scalds with safety. By his gates of breath\n"+
		"There lies a downy feather which stirs not:\n"+
		"Did he suspire, that light and weightless down\n"+
		"Perforce must move. My gracious lord! my father!\n"+
		"This sleep is sound indeed, this is a sleep\n"+
		"That from this golden rigol hath divorced\n"+
		"So many English kings. Thy due from me\n"+
		"Is tears and heavy sorrows of the blood,\n"+
		"Which nature, love, and filial tenderness,\n"+
		"Shall, O dear father, pay thee plenteously:\n"+
		"My due from thee is this imperial crown,\n"+
		"Which, as immediate as thy place and blood,\n"+
		"Derives itself to me. Lo, here it sits,\n"+
		"Which God shall guard: and put the world's whole strength\n"+
		"Into one giant arm, it shall not force\n"+
		"This lineal honour from me: this from thee\n"+
		"Will I to mine leave, as 'tis left to me.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"Warwick! Gloucester! Clarence!\n"+
		"Re-enter WARWICK, GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, and the rest\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"Doth the king call?\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"What would your majesty? How fares your grace?\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"Why did you leave me here alone, my lords?\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"We left the prince my brother here, my liege,\n"+
		"Who undertook to sit and watch by you.\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"The Prince of Wales! Where is he? let me see him:\n"+
		"He is not here.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"This door is open; he is gone this way.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"He came not through the chamber where we stay'd.\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"Where is the crown? who took it from my pillow?\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"When we withdrew, my liege, we left it here.\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"The prince hath ta'en it hence: go, seek him out.\n"+
		"Is he so hasty that he doth suppose\n"+
		"My sleep my death?\n"+
		"Find him, my Lord of Warwick; chide him hither.\n"+
		"Exit WARWICK\n"+
		"This part of his conjoins with my disease,\n"+
		"And helps to end me. See, sons, what things you are!\n"+
		"How quickly nature falls into revolt\n"+
		"When gold becomes her object!\n"+
		"For this the foolish over-careful fathers\n"+
		"Have broke their sleep with thoughts, their brains with care,\n"+
		"Their bones with industry;\n"+
		"For this they have engrossed and piled up\n"+
		"The canker'd heaps of strange-achieved gold;\n"+
		"For this they have been thoughtful to invest\n"+
		"Their sons with arts and martial exercises:\n"+
		"When, like the bee, culling from every flower\n"+
		"The virtuous sweets,\n"+
		"Our thighs pack'd with wax, our mouths with honey,\n"+
		"We bring it to the hive, and, like the bees,\n"+
		"Are murdered for our pains. This bitter taste\n"+
		"Yield his engrossments to the ending father.\n"+
		"Re-enter WARWICK\n"+
		"Now, where is he that will not stay so long\n"+
		"Till his friend sickness hath determined me?\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"My lord, I found the prince in the next room,\n"+
		"Washing with kindly tears his gentle cheeks,\n"+
		"With such a deep demeanor in great sorrow\n"+
		"That tyranny, which never quaff'd but blood,\n"+
		"Would, by beholding him, have wash'd his knife\n"+
		"With gentle eye-drops. He is coming hither.\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"But wherefore did he take away the crown?\n"+
		"Re-enter PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"Lo, where he comes. Come hither to me, Harry.\n"+
		"Depart the chamber, leave us here alone.\n"+
		"Exeunt WARWICK and the rest\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"I never thought to hear you speak again.\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"Thy wish was father, Harry, to that thought:\n"+
		"I stay too long by thee, I weary thee.\n"+
		"Dost thou so hunger for mine empty chair\n"+
		"That thou wilt needs invest thee with my honours\n"+
		"Before thy hour be ripe? O foolish youth!\n"+
		"Thou seek'st the greatness that will o'erwhelm thee.\n"+
		"Stay but a little; for my cloud of dignity\n"+
		"Is held from falling with so weak a wind\n"+
		"That it will quickly drop: my day is dim.\n"+
		"Thou hast stolen that which after some few hours\n"+
		"Were thine without offence; and at my death\n"+
		"Thou hast seal'd up my expectation:\n"+
		"Thy life did manifest thou lovedst me not,\n"+
		"And thou wilt have me die assured of it.\n"+
		"Thou hidest a thousand daggers in thy thoughts,\n"+
		"Which thou hast whetted on thy stony heart,\n"+
		"To stab at half an hour of my life.\n"+
		"What! canst thou not forbear me half an hour?\n"+
		"Then get thee gone and dig my grave thyself,\n"+
		"And bid the merry bells ring to thine ear\n"+
		"That thou art crowned, not that I am dead.\n"+
		"Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse\n"+
		"Be drops of balm to sanctify thy head:\n"+
		"Only compound me with forgotten dust\n"+
		"Give that which gave thee life unto the worms.\n"+
		"Pluck down my officers, break my decrees;\n"+
		"For now a time is come to mock at form:\n"+
		"Harry the Fifth is crown'd: up, vanity!\n"+
		"Down, royal state! all you sage counsellors, hence!\n"+
		"And to the English court assemble now,\n"+
		"From every region, apes of idleness!\n"+
		"Now, neighbour confines, purge you of your scum:\n"+
		"Have you a ruffian that will swear, drink, dance,\n"+
		"Revel the night, rob, murder, and commit\n"+
		"The oldest sins the newest kind of ways?\n"+
		"Be happy, he will trouble you no more;\n"+
		"England shall double gild his treble guilt,\n"+
		"England shall give him office, honour, might;\n"+
		"For the fifth Harry from curb'd licence plucks\n"+
		"The muzzle of restraint, and the wild dog\n"+
		"Shall flesh his tooth on every innocent.\n"+
		"O my poor kingdom, sick with civil blows!\n"+
		"When that my care could not withhold thy riots,\n"+
		"What wilt thou do when riot is thy care?\n"+
		"O, thou wilt be a wilderness again,\n"+
		"Peopled with wolves, thy old inhabitants!\n"+
		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+
		"O, pardon me, my liege! but for my tears,\n"+
		"The moist impediments unto my speech,\n"+
		"I had forestall'd this dear and deep rebuke\n"+
		"Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard\n"+
		"The course of it so far. There is your crown;\n"+
		"And He that wears the crown immortally\n"+
		"Long guard it yours! If I affect it more\n"+
		"Than as your honour and as your renown,\n"+
		"Let me no more from this obedience rise,\n"+
		"Which my most inward true and duteous spirit\n"+
		"Teacheth, this prostrate and exterior bending.\n"+
		"God witness with me, when I here came in,\n"+
		"And found no course of breath within your majesty,\n"+
		"How cold it struck my heart! If I do feign,\n"+
		"O, let me in my present wildness die\n"+
		"And never live to show the incredulous world\n"+
		"The noble change that I have purposed!\n"+
		"Coming to look on you, thinking you dead,\n"+
		"And dead almost, my liege, to think you were,\n"+
		"I spake unto this crown as having sense,\n"+
		"And thus upbraided it: 'The care on thee depending\n"+
		"Hath fed upon the body of my father;\n"+
		"Therefore, thou best of gold art worst of gold:\n"+
		"Other, less fine in carat, is more precious,\n"+
		"Preserving life in medicine potable;\n"+
		"But thou, most fine, most honour'd: most renown'd,\n"+
		"Hast eat thy bearer up.' Thus, my most royal liege,\n"+
		"Accusing it, I put it on my head,\n"+
		"To try with it, as with an enemy\n"+
		"That had before my face murder'd my father,\n"+
		"The quarrel of a true inheritor.\n"+
		"But if it did infect my blood with joy,\n"+
		"Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride;\n"+
		"If any rebel or vain spirit of mine\n"+
		"Did with the least affection of a welcome\n"+
		"Give entertainment to the might of it,\n"+
		"Let God for ever keep it from my head\n"+
		"And make me as the poorest vassal is\n"+
		"That doth with awe and terror kneel to it!\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"O my son,\n"+
		"God put it in thy mind to take it hence,\n"+
		"That thou mightst win the more thy father's love,\n"+
		"Pleading so wisely in excuse of it!\n"+
		"Come hither, Harry, sit thou by my bed;\n"+
		"And hear, I think, the very latest counsel\n"+
		"That ever I shall breathe. God knows, my son,\n"+
		"By what by-paths and indirect crook'd ways\n"+
		"I met this crown; and I myself know well\n"+
		"How troublesome it sat upon my head.\n"+
		"To thee it shall descend with bitter quiet,\n"+
		"Better opinion, better confirmation;\n"+
		"For all the soil of the achievement goes\n"+
		"With me into the earth. It seem'd in me\n"+
		"But as an honour snatch'd with boisterous hand,\n"+
		"And I had many living to upbraid\n"+
		"My gain of it by their assistances;\n"+
		"Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed,\n"+

		"Thou see'st with peril I have answered;\n"+
		"For all my reign hath been but as a scene\n"+
		"Acting that argument: and now my death\n"+
		"Changes the mode; for what in me was purchased,\n"+
		"Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort;\n"+
		"So thou the garland wear'st successively.\n"+
		"Yet, though thou stand'st more sure than I could do,\n"+
		"Thou art not firm enough, since griefs are green;\n"+
		"And all my friends, which thou must make thy friends,\n"+
		"Have but their stings and teeth newly ta'en out;\n"+
		"By whose fell working I was first advanced\n"+
		"And by whose power I well might lodge a fear\n"+
		"To be again displaced: which to avoid,\n"+
		"I cut them off; and had a purpose now\n"+
		"To lead out many to the Holy Land,\n"+
		"Lest rest and lying still might make them look\n"+
		"Too near unto my state. Therefore, my Harry,\n"+
		"Be it thy course to busy giddy minds\n"+
		"With foreign quarrels; that action, hence borne out,\n"+
		"May waste the memory of the former days.\n"+
		"More would I, but my lungs are wasted so\n"+
		"That strength of speech is utterly denied me.\n"+
		"How I came by the crown, O God forgive;\n"+

		"PRINCE HENRY\n"+

		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"Look, look, here comes my John of Lancaster.\n"+
		"LANCASTER\n"+
		"Health, peace, and happiness to my royal father!\n"+

		"My Lord of Warwick!\n"+

		"SCENE I. Gloucestershire. SHALLOW'S house.\n"+
		"Enter SHALLOW, FALSTAFF, BARDOLPH, and Page\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"By cock and pie, sir, you shall not away to-night.\n"+
		"What, Davy, I say!\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"You must excuse me, Master Robert Shallow.\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"I will not excuse you; you shall not be excused;\n"+
		"excuses shall not be admitted; there is no excuse\n"+
		"shall serve; you shall not be excused. Why, Davy!\n"+
		"Enter DAVY\n"+
		"DAVY\n"+
		"Here, sir.\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"Davy, Davy, Davy, Davy, let me see, Davy; let me\n"+
		"see, Davy; let me see: yea, marry, William cook,\n"+
		"bid him come hither. Sir John, you shall not be excused.\n"+
		"DAVY\n"+
		"Marry, sir, thus; those precepts cannot be served:\n"+
		"and, again, sir, shall we sow the headland with wheat?\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"With red wheat, Davy. But for William cook: are\n"+
		"there no young pigeons?\n"+
		"DAVY\n"+
		"Yes, sir. Here is now the smith's note for shoeing\n"+
		"and plough-irons.\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"Let it be cast and paid. Sir John, you shall not be excused.\n"+
		"DAVY\n"+
		"Now, sir, a new link to the bucket must need be\n"+
		"had: and, sir, do you mean to stop any of William's\n"+
		"wages, about the sack he lost the other day at\n"+
		"Hinckley fair?\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"A' shall answer it. Some pigeons, Davy, a couple\n"+
		"of short-legged hens, a joint of mutton, and any\n"+
		"pretty little tiny kickshaws, tell William cook.\n"+
		"DAVY\n"+
		"Doth the man of war stay all night, sir?\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"Yea, Davy. I will use him well: a friend i' the\n"+
		"court is better than a penny in purse. Use his men\n"+
		"well, Davy; for they are arrant knaves, and will backbite.\n"+
		"DAVY\n"+
		"No worse than they are backbitten, sir; for they\n"+
		"have marvellous foul linen.\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"Well conceited, Davy: about thy business, Davy.\n"+
		"DAVY\n"+
		"I beseech you, sir, to countenance William Visor of\n"+
		"Woncot against Clement Perkes of the hill.\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"There is many complaints, Davy, against that Visor:\n"+
		"that Visor is an arrant knave, on my knowledge.\n"+
		"DAVY\n"+
		"I grant your worship that he is a knave, sir; but\n"+
		"yet, God forbid, sir, but a knave should have some\n"+
		"countenance at his friend's request. An honest\n"+
		"man, sir, is able to speak for himself, when a knave\n"+
		"is not. I have served your worship truly, sir,\n"+
		"this eight years; and if I cannot once or twice in\n"+
		"a quarter bear out a knave against an honest man, I\n"+
		"have but a very little credit with your worship. The\n"+
		"knave is mine honest friend, sir; therefore, I\n"+
		"beseech your worship, let him be countenanced.\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"Go to; I say he shall have no wrong. Look about, Davy.\n"+
		"Exit DAVY\n"+
		"Where are you, Sir John? Come, come, come, off\n"+
		"with your boots. Give me your hand, Master Bardolph.\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"I am glad to see your worship.\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"I thank thee with all my heart, kind\n"+
		"Master Bardolph: and welcome, my tall fellow.\n"+
		"To the Page\n"+
		"Come, Sir John.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"I'll follow you, good Master Robert Shallow.\n"+
		"Exit SHALLOW\n"+
		"Bardolph, look to our horses.\n"+
		"Exeunt BARDOLPH and Page\n"+
		"If I were sawed into quantities, I should make four\n"+
		"dozen of such bearded hermits' staves as Master\n"+
		"Shallow. It is a wonderful thing to see the\n"+
		"semblable coherence of his men's spirits and his:\n"+
		"they, by observing of him, do bear themselves like\n"+
		"foolish justices; he, by conversing with them, is\n"+
		"turned into a justice-like serving-man: their\n"+
		"spirits are so married in conjunction with the\n"+
		"participation of society that they flock together in\n"+
		"consent, like so many wild-geese. If I had a suit\n"+
		"to Master Shallow, I would humour his men with the\n"+
		"imputation of being near their master: if to his\n"+
		"men, I would curry with Master Shallow that no man\n"+
		"could better command his servants. It is certain\n"+
		"that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is\n"+
		"caught, as men take diseases, one of another:\n"+
		"therefore let men take heed of their company. I\n"+
		"will devise matter enough out of this Shallow to\n"+
		"keep Prince Harry in continual laughter the wearing\n"+
		"out of six fashions, which is four terms, or two\n"+
		"actions, and a' shall laugh without intervallums. O,\n"+
		"it is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest\n"+
		"with a sad brow will do with a fellow that never\n"+
		"had the ache in his shoulders! O, you shall see him\n"+
		"laugh till his face be like a wet cloak ill laid up!\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"[Within] Sir John!\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"I come, Master Shallow; I come, Master Shallow.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE II. Westminster. The palace.\n"+
		"Enter WARWICK and the Lord Chief-Justice, meeting\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"How now, my lord chief-justice! whither away?\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice How doth the king?\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Exceeding well; his cares are now all ended.\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice I hope, not dead.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"He's walk'd the way of nature;\n"+
		"And to our purposes he lives no more.\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice I would his majesty had call'd me with him:\n"+
		"The service that I truly did his life\n"+
		"Hath left me open to all injuries.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Indeed I think the young king loves you not.\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice I know he doth not, and do arm myself\n"+
		"To welcome the condition of the time,\n"+
		"Which cannot look more hideously upon me\n"+
		"Than I have drawn it in my fantasy.\n"+
		"Enter LANCASTER, CLARENCE, GLOUCESTER, WESTMORELAND, and others\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Here come the heavy issue of dead Harry:\n"+
		"O that the living Harry had the temper\n"+
		"Of him, the worst of these three gentlemen!\n"+
		"How many nobles then should hold their places\n"+
		"That must strike sail to spirits of vile sort!\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice O God, I fear all will be overturn'd!\n"+
		"LANCASTER\n"+
		"Good morrow, cousin Warwick, good morrow.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"Good morrow, cousin.\n"+
		"LANCASTER\n"+
		"We meet like men that had forgot to speak.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"We do remember; but our argument\n"+
		"Is all too heavy to admit much talk.\n"+
		"LANCASTER\n"+
		"Well, peace be with him that hath made us heavy.\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice Peace be with us, lest we be heavier!\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"O, good my lord, you have lost a friend indeed;\n"+
		"And I dare swear you borrow not that face\n"+
		"Of seeming sorrow, it is sure your own.\n"+
		"LANCASTER\n"+
		"Though no man be assured what grace to find,\n"+
		"You stand in coldest expectation:\n"+
		"I am the sorrier; would 'twere otherwise.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"Well, you must now speak Sir John Falstaff fair;\n"+
		"Which swims against your stream of quality.\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice Sweet princes, what I did, I did in honour,\n"+
		"Led by the impartial conduct of my soul:\n"+
		"And never shall you see that I will beg\n"+
		"A ragged and forestall'd remission.\n"+
		"If truth and upright innocency fail me,\n"+
		"I'll to the king my master that is dead,\n"+
		"And tell him who hath sent me after him.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Here comes the prince.\n"+
		"Enter KING HENRY V, attended\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice Good morrow; and God save your majesty!\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"This new and gorgeous garment, majesty,\n"+
		"Sits not so easy on me as you think.\n"+
		"Brothers, you mix your sadness with some fear:\n"+
		"This is the English, not the Turkish court;\n"+
		"Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds,\n"+
		"But Harry Harry. Yet be sad, good brothers,\n"+
		"For, by my faith, it very well becomes you:\n"+
		"Sorrow so royally in you appears\n"+
		"That I will deeply put the fashion on\n"+
		"And wear it in my heart: why then, be sad;\n"+
		"But entertain no more of it, good brothers,\n"+
		"Than a joint burden laid upon us all.\n"+
		"For me, by heaven, I bid you be assured,\n"+
		"I'll be your father and your brother too;\n"+
		"Let me but bear your love, I 'll bear your cares:\n"+
		"Yet weep that Harry's dead; and so will I;\n"+
		"But Harry lives, that shall convert those tears\n"+
		"By number into hours of happiness.\n"+
		"Princes\n"+
		"We hope no other from your majesty.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"You all look strangely on me: and you most;\n"+
		"You are, I think, assured I love you not.\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice I am assured, if I be measured rightly,\n"+
		"Your majesty hath no just cause to hate me.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"No!\n"+
		"How might a prince of my great hopes forget\n"+
		"So great indignities you laid upon me?\n"+
		"What! rate, rebuke, and roughly send to prison\n"+
		"The immediate heir of England! Was this easy?\n"+
		"May this be wash'd in Lethe, and forgotten?\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice I then did use the person of your father;\n"+
		"The image of his power lay then in me:\n"+
		"And, in the administration of his law,\n"+
		"Whiles I was busy for the commonwealth,\n"+
		"Your highness pleased to forget my place,\n"+
		"The majesty and power of law and justice,\n"+
		"The image of the king whom I presented,\n"+
		"And struck me in my very seat of judgment;\n"+
		"Whereon, as an offender to your father,\n"+
		"I gave bold way to my authority\n"+
		"And did commit you. If the deed were ill,\n"+
		"Be you contented, wearing now the garland,\n"+
		"To have a son set your decrees at nought,\n"+
		"To pluck down justice from your awful bench,\n"+
		"To trip the course of law and blunt the sword\n"+
		"That guards the peace and safety of your person;\n"+
		"Nay, more, to spurn at your most royal image\n"+
		"And mock your workings in a second body.\n"+
		"Question your royal thoughts, make the case yours;\n"+
		"Be now the father and propose a son,\n"+
		"Hear your own dignity so much profaned,\n"+
		"See your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted,\n"+
		"Behold yourself so by a son disdain'd;\n"+
		"And then imagine me taking your part\n"+
		"And in your power soft silencing your son:\n"+
		"After this cold considerance, sentence me;\n"+
		"And, as you are a king, speak in your state\n"+
		"What I have done that misbecame my place,\n"+
		"My person, or my liege's sovereignty.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"You are right, justice, and you weigh this well;\n"+
		"Therefore still bear the balance and the sword:\n"+
		"And I do wish your honours may increase,\n"+
		"Till you do live to see a son of mine\n"+
		"Offend you and obey you, as I did.\n"+
		"So shall I live to speak my father's words:\n"+
		"'Happy am I, that have a man so bold,\n"+
		"That dares do justice on my proper son;\n"+
		"And not less happy, having such a son,\n"+
		"That would deliver up his greatness so\n"+
		"Into the hands of justice.' You did commit me:\n"+
		"For which, I do commit into your hand\n"+
		"The unstained sword that you have used to bear;\n"+
		"With this remembrance, that you use the same\n"+
		"With the like bold, just and impartial spirit\n"+
		"As you have done 'gainst me. There is my hand.\n"+
		"You shall be as a father to my youth:\n"+
		"My voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear,\n"+
		"And I will stoop and humble my intents\n"+
		"To your well-practised wise directions.\n"+
		"And, princes all, believe me, I beseech you;\n"+
		"My father is gone wild into his grave,\n"+
		"For in his tomb lie my affections;\n"+
		"And with his spirit sadly I survive,\n"+
		"To mock the expectation of the world,\n"+
		"To frustrate prophecies and to raze out\n"+
		"Rotten opinion, who hath writ me down\n"+
		"After my seeming. The tide of blood in me\n"+
		"Hath proudly flow'd in vanity till now:\n"+
		"Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea,\n"+
		"Where it shall mingle with the state of floods\n"+
		"And flow henceforth in formal majesty.\n"+
		"Now call we our high court of parliament:\n"+
		"And let us choose such limbs of noble counsel,\n"+
		"That the great body of our state may go\n"+
		"In equal rank with the best govern'd nation;\n"+
		"That war, or peace, or both at once, may be\n"+
		"As things acquainted and familiar to us;\n"+
		"In which you, father, shall have foremost hand.\n"+
		"Our coronation done, we will accite,\n"+
		"As I before remember'd, all our state:\n"+
		"And, God consigning to my good intents,\n"+
		"No prince nor peer shall have just cause to say,\n"+
		"God shorten Harry's happy life one day!\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+

		"SCENE IV. London. A street.\n"+
		"Enter Beadles, dragging in HOSTESS QUICKLY and DOLL TEARSHEET\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"No, thou arrant knave; I would to God that I might\n"+
		"die, that I might have thee hanged: thou hast\n"+
		"drawn my shoulder out of joint.\n"+
		"First Beadle\n"+
		"The constables have delivered her over to me; and\n"+
		"she shall have whipping-cheer enough, I warrant\n"+
		"her: there hath been a man or two lately killed about her.\n"+
		"DOLL TEARSHEET\n"+
		"Nut-hook, nut-hook, you lie. Come on; I 'll tell\n"+
		"thee what, thou damned tripe-visaged rascal, an\n"+
		"the child I now go with do miscarry, thou wert\n"+
		"better thou hadst struck thy mother, thou\n"+
		"paper-faced villain.\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"O the Lord, that Sir John were come! he would make\n"+
		"this a bloody day to somebody. But I pray God the\n"+
		"fruit of her womb miscarry!\n"+
		"First Beadle\n"+
		"If it do, you shall have a dozen of cushions again;\n"+
		"you have but eleven now. Come, I charge you both go\n"+
		"with me; for the man is dead that you and Pistol\n"+
		"beat amongst you.\n"+
		"DOLL TEARSHEET\n"+
		"I'll tell you what, you thin man in a censer, I\n"+
		"will have you as soundly swinged for this,--you\n"+
		"blue-bottle rogue, you filthy famished correctioner,\n"+
		"if you be not swinged, I'll forswear half-kirtles.\n"+
		"First Beadle\n"+
		"Come, come, you she knight-errant, come.\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"O God, that right should thus overcome might!\n"+
		"Well, of sufferance comes ease.\n"+
		"DOLL TEARSHEET\n"+
		"Come, you rogue, come; bring me to a justice.\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"Ay, come, you starved blood-hound.\n"+
		"DOLL TEARSHEET\n"+
		"Goodman death, goodman bones!\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"Thou atomy, thou!\n"+
		"DOLL TEARSHEET\n"+
		"Come, you thin thing; come you rascal.\n"+
		"First Beadle\n"+
		"Very well.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE V. A public place near Westminster Abbey.\n"+
		"Enter two Grooms, strewing rushes\n"+
		"First Groom\n"+
		"More rushes, more rushes.\n"+
		"Second Groom\n"+
		"The trumpets have sounded twice.\n"+
		"First Groom\n"+
		"'Twill be two o'clock ere they come from the\n"+
		"coronation: dispatch, dispatch.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"Enter FALSTAFF, SHALLOW, PISTOL, BARDOLPH, and Page\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Stand here by me, Master Robert Shallow; I will\n"+
		"make the king do you grace: I will leer upon him as\n"+
		"a' comes by; and do but mark the countenance that he\n"+
		"will give me.\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"God bless thy lungs, good knight.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Come here, Pistol; stand behind me. O, if I had had\n"+
		"time to have made new liveries, I would have\n"+
		"bestowed the thousand pound I borrowed of you. But\n"+
		"'tis no matter; this poor show doth better: this\n"+
		"doth infer the zeal I had to see him.\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"It doth so.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"It shows my earnestness of affection,--\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"It doth so.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"My devotion,--\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"It doth, it doth, it doth.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"As it were, to ride day and night; and not to\n"+
		"deliberate, not to remember, not to have patience\n"+
		"to shift me,--\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"It is best, certain.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"But to stand stained with travel, and sweating with\n"+
		"desire to see him; thinking of nothing else,\n"+
		"putting all affairs else in oblivion, as if there\n"+
		"were nothing else to be done but to see him.\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"'Tis 'semper idem,' for 'obsque hoc nihil est:'\n"+
		"'tis all in every part.\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"'Tis so, indeed.\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"My knight, I will inflame thy noble liver,\n"+
		"And make thee rage.\n"+
		"Thy Doll, and Helen of thy noble thoughts,\n"+
		"Is in base durance and contagious prison;\n"+
		"Haled thither\n"+
		"By most mechanical and dirty hand:\n"+
		"Rouse up revenge from ebon den with fell\n"+
		"Alecto's snake,\n"+
		"For Doll is in. Pistol speaks nought but truth.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"I will deliver her.\n"+
		"Shouts within, and the trumpets sound\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"There roar'd the sea, and trumpet-clangor sounds.\n"+
		"Enter KING HENRY V and his train, the Lord Chief- Justice among them\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"God save thy grace, King Hal! my royal Hal!\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"The heavens thee guard and keep, most royal imp of fame!\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"God save thee, my sweet boy!\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"My lord chief-justice, speak to that vain man.\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice Have you your wits? know you what 'tis to speak?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"My king! my Jove! I speak to thee, my heart!\n"+
		"KING HENRY IV\n"+
		"I know thee not, old man: fall to thy prayers;\n"+
		"How ill white hairs become a fool and jester!\n"+
		"I have long dream'd of such a kind of man,\n"+
		"So surfeit-swell'd, so old and so profane;\n"+
		"But, being awaked, I do despise my dream.\n"+
		"Make less thy body hence, and more thy grace;\n"+
		"Leave gormandizing; know the grave doth gape\n"+
		"For thee thrice wider than for other men.\n"+
		"Reply not to me with a fool-born jest:\n"+
		"Presume not that I am the thing I was;\n"+
		"For God doth know, so shall the world perceive,\n"+
		"That I have turn'd away my former self;\n"+
		"So will I those that kept me company.\n"+
		"When thou dost hear I am as I have been,\n"+
		"Approach me, and thou shalt be as thou wast,\n"+
		"The tutor and the feeder of my riots:\n"+
		"Till then, I banish thee, on pain of death,\n"+
		"As I have done the rest of my misleaders,\n"+
		"Not to come near our person by ten mile.\n"+
		"For competence of life I will allow you,\n"+
		"That lack of means enforce you not to evil:\n"+
		"And, as we hear you do reform yourselves,\n"+
		"We will, according to your strengths and qualities,\n"+
		"Give you advancement. Be it your charge, my lord,\n"+
		"To see perform'd the tenor of our word. Set on.\n"+
		"Exeunt KING HENRY V, & c\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Master Shallow, I owe you a thousand pound.\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"Yea, marry, Sir John; which I beseech you to let me\n"+
		"have home with me.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"That can hardly be, Master Shallow. Do not you\n"+
		"grieve at this; I shall be sent for in private to\n"+
		"him: look you, he must seem thus to the world:\n"+
		"fear not your advancements; I will be the man yet\n"+
		"that shall make you great.\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"I cannot well perceive how, unless you should give\n"+
		"me your doublet and stuff me out with straw. I\n"+
		"beseech you, good Sir John, let me have five hundred\n"+
		"of my thousand.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Sir, I will be as good as my word: this that you\n"+
		"heard was but a colour.\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"A colour that I fear you will die in, Sir John.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Fear no colours: go with me to dinner: come,\n"+
		"Lieutenant Pistol; come, Bardolph: I shall be sent\n"+
		"for soon at night.\n"+
		"Re-enter Prince John of LANCASTER, the Lord Chief-Justice; Officers with them\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice Go, carry Sir John Falstaff to the Fleet:\n"+
		"Take all his company along with him.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"My lord, my lord,--\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice I cannot now speak: I will hear you soon.\n"+
		"Take them away.\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"Si fortune me tormenta, spero contenta.\n"+
		"Exeunt all but PRINCE JOHN and the Lord Chief-Justice\n"+
		"LANCASTER\n"+
		"I like this fair proceeding of the king's:\n"+
		"He hath intent his wonted followers\n"+
		"Shall all be very well provided for;\n"+
		"But all are banish'd till their conversations\n"+
		"Appear more wise and modest to the world.\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice And so they are.\n"+
		"LANCASTER\n"+
		"The king hath call'd his parliament, my lord.\n"+
		"Lord Chief-Justice He hath.\n"+
		"LANCASTER\n"+
		"I will lay odds that, ere this year expire,\n"+
		"We bear our civil swords and native fire\n"+
		"As far as France: I beard a bird so sing,\n"+
		"Whose music, to my thinking, pleased the king.\n"+
		"Come, will you hence?\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"EPILOGUE\n"+
		"Spoken by a Dancer\n"+
		"First my fear; then my courtesy; last my speech.\n"+
		"My fear is, your displeasure; my courtesy, my duty;\n"+
		"and my speech, to beg your pardons. If you look\n"+
		"for a good speech now, you undo me: for what I have\n"+
		"to say is of mine own making; and what indeed I\n"+
		"should say will, I doubt, prove mine own marring.\n"+
		"But to the purpose, and so to the venture. Be it\n"+
		"known to you, as it is very well, I was lately here\n"+
		"in the end of a displeasing play, to pray your\n"+
		"patience for it and to promise you a better. I\n"+
		"meant indeed to pay you with this; which, if like an\n"+
		"ill venture it come unluckily home, I break, and\n"+
		"you, my gentle creditors, lose. Here I promised you\n"+
		"I would be and here I commit my body to your\n"+
		"mercies: bate me some and I will pay you some and,\n"+
		"as most debtors do, promise you infinitely.\n"+
		"If my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me, will\n"+
		"you command me to use my legs? and yet that were but\n"+
		"light payment, to dance out of your debt. But a\n"+
		"good conscience will make any possible satisfaction,\n"+
		"and so would I. All the gentlewomen here have\n"+
		"forgiven me: if the gentlemen will not, then the\n"+
		"gentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen, which\n"+
		"was never seen before in such an assembly.\n"+
		"One word more, I beseech you. If you be not too\n"+
		"much cloyed with fat meat, our humble author will\n"+
		"continue the story, with Sir John in it, and make\n"+
		"you merry with fair Katharine of France: where, for\n"+
		"any thing I know, Falstaff shall die of a sweat,\n"+
		"unless already a' be killed with your hard\n"+
		"opinions; for Oldcastle died a martyr, and this is\n"+
		"not the man. My tongue is weary; when my legs are\n"+
		"too, I will bid you good night: and so kneel down\n"+
		"before you; but, indeed, to pray for the queen.\n"
