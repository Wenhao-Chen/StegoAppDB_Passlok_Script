		"The Life and Death of Richard the Third\n"+
		"ACT I\n"+
		"SCENE I. London. A street.\n"+
		"Enter GLOUCESTER, solus\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Now is the winter of our discontent\n"+
		"Made glorious summer by this sun of York;\n"+
		"And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house\n"+
		"In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.\n"+
		"Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;\n"+
		"Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;\n"+
		"Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,\n"+
		"Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.\n"+
		"Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;\n"+
		"And now, instead of mounting barded steeds\n"+
		"To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,\n"+
		"He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber\n"+
		"To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.\n"+
		"But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,\n"+
		"Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;\n"+
		"I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty\n"+
		"To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;\n"+
		"I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,\n"+
		"Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,\n"+
		"Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time\n"+
		"Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,\n"+
		"And that so lamely and unfashionable\n"+
		"That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;\n"+
		"Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,\n"+
		"Have no delight to pass away the time,\n"+
		"Unless to spy my shadow in the sun\n"+
		"And descant on mine own deformity:\n"+
		"And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,\n"+
		"To entertain these fair well-spoken days,\n"+
		"I am determined to prove a villain\n"+
		"And hate the idle pleasures of these days.\n"+
		"Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,\n"+
		"By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,\n"+
		"To set my brother Clarence and the king\n"+
		"In deadly hate the one against the other:\n"+
		"And if King Edward be as true and just\n"+
		"As I am subtle, false and treacherous,\n"+
		"This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,\n"+
		"About a prophecy, which says that 'G'\n"+
		"Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.\n"+
		"Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here\n"+
		"Clarence comes.\n"+
		"Enter CLARENCE, guarded, and BRAKENBURY\n"+
		"Brother, good day; what means this armed guard\n"+
		"That waits upon your grace?\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"His majesty\n"+
		"Tendering my person's safety, hath appointed\n"+
		"This conduct to convey me to the Tower.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Upon what cause?\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"Because my name is George.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;\n"+
		"He should, for that, commit your godfathers:\n"+
		"O, belike his majesty hath some intent\n"+
		"That you shall be new-christen'd in the Tower.\n"+
		"But what's the matter, Clarence? may I know?\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest\n"+
		"As yet I do not: but, as I can learn,\n"+
		"He hearkens after prophecies and dreams;\n"+
		"And from the cross-row plucks the letter G.\n"+
		"And says a wizard told him that by G\n"+
		"His issue disinherited should be;\n"+
		"And, for my name of George begins with G,\n"+
		"It follows in his thought that I am he.\n"+
		"These, as I learn, and such like toys as these\n"+
		"Have moved his highness to commit me now.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Why, this it is, when men are ruled by women:\n"+
		"'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower:\n"+
		"My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she\n"+
		"That tempers him to this extremity.\n"+
		"Was it not she and that good man of worship,\n"+
		"Anthony Woodville, her brother there,\n"+
		"That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,\n"+
		"From whence this present day he is deliver'd?\n"+
		"We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"By heaven, I think there's no man is secure\n"+
		"But the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds\n"+
		"That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore.\n"+
		"Heard ye not what an humble suppliant\n"+
		"Lord hastings was to her for his delivery?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Humbly complaining to her deity\n"+
		"Got my lord chamberlain his liberty.\n"+
		"I'll tell you what; I think it is our way,\n"+
		"If we will keep in favour with the king,\n"+
		"To be her men and wear her livery:\n"+
		"The jealous o'erworn widow and herself,\n"+
		"Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen.\n"+
		"Are mighty gossips in this monarchy.\n"+
		"BRAKENBURY\n"+
		"I beseech your graces both to pardon me;\n"+
		"His majesty hath straitly given in charge\n"+
		"That no man shall have private conference,\n"+
		"Of what degree soever, with his brother.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Even so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury,\n"+
		"You may partake of any thing we say:\n"+
		"We speak no treason, man: we say the king\n"+
		"Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen\n"+
		"Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;\n"+
		"We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,\n"+
		"A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;\n"+
		"And that the queen's kindred are made gentle-folks:\n"+
		"How say you sir? Can you deny all this?\n"+
		"BRAKENBURY\n"+
		"With this, my lord, myself have nought to do.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Naught to do with mistress Shore! I tell thee, fellow,\n"+
		"He that doth naught with her, excepting one,\n"+
		"Were best he do it secretly, alone.\n"+
		"BRAKENBURY\n"+
		"What one, my lord?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Her husband, knave: wouldst thou betray me?\n"+
		"BRAKENBURY\n"+
		"I beseech your grace to pardon me, and withal\n"+
		"Forbear your conference with the noble duke.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"We are the queen's abjects, and must obey.\n"+
		"Brother, farewell: I will unto the king;\n"+
		"And whatsoever you will employ me in,\n"+
		"Were it to call King Edward's widow sister,\n"+
		"I will perform it to enfranchise you.\n"+
		"Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood\n"+
		"Touches me deeper than you can imagine.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"I know it pleaseth neither of us well.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;\n"+
		"Meantime, have patience.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"I must perforce. Farewell.\n"+
		"Exeunt CLARENCE, BRAKENBURY, and Guard\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.\n"+
		"Simple, plain Clarence! I do love thee so,\n"+
		"That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,\n"+
		"If heaven will take the present at our hands.\n"+
		"But who comes here? the new-deliver'd Hastings?\n"+
		"Enter HASTINGS\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"Good time of day unto my gracious lord!\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"As much unto my good lord chamberlain!\n"+
		"Well are you welcome to the open air.\n"+
		"How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must:\n"+
		"But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks\n"+
		"That were the cause of my imprisonment.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;\n"+
		"For they that were your enemies are his,\n"+
		"And have prevail'd as much on him as you.\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"More pity that the eagle should be mew'd,\n"+
		"While kites and buzzards prey at liberty.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"What news abroad?\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"No news so bad abroad as this at home;\n"+
		"The King is sickly, weak and melancholy,\n"+
		"And his physicians fear him mightily.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Now, by Saint Paul, this news is bad indeed.\n"+
		"O, he hath kept an evil diet long,\n"+
		"And overmuch consumed his royal person:\n"+
		"'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.\n"+
		"What, is he in his bed?\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"He is.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Go you before, and I will follow you.\n"+
		"Exit HASTINGS\n"+
		"He cannot live, I hope; and must not die\n"+
		"Till George be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven.\n"+
		"I'll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence,\n"+
		"With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments;\n"+
		"And, if I fall not in my deep intent,\n"+
		"Clarence hath not another day to live:\n"+
		"Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,\n"+
		"And leave the world for me to bustle in!\n"+
		"For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.\n"+
		"What though I kill'd her husband and her father?\n"+
		"The readiest way to make the wench amends\n"+
		"Is to become her husband and her father:\n"+
		"The which will I; not all so much for love\n"+
		"As for another secret close intent,\n"+
		"By marrying her which I must reach unto.\n"+
		"But yet I run before my horse to market:\n"+
		"Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:\n"+
		"When they are gone, then must I count my gains.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE II. The same. Another street.\n"+
		"Enter the corpse of KING HENRY the Sixth, Gentlemen with halberds to guard it; LADY ANNE being the mourner\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"Set down, set down your honourable load,\n"+
		"If honour may be shrouded in a hearse,\n"+
		"Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament\n"+
		"The untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.\n"+
		"Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!\n"+
		"Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!\n"+
		"Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!\n"+
		"Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost,\n"+
		"To hear the lamentations of Poor Anne,\n"+
		"Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughter'd son,\n"+
		"Stabb'd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds!\n"+
		"Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life,\n"+
		"I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.\n"+
		"Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes!\n"+
		"Cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it!\n"+
		"Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!\n"+
		"More direful hap betide that hated wretch,\n"+
		"That makes us wretched by the death of thee,\n"+
		"Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,\n"+
		"Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!\n"+
		"If ever he have child, abortive be it,\n"+
		"Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,\n"+
		"Whose ugly and unnatural aspect\n"+
		"May fright the hopeful mother at the view;\n"+
		"And that be heir to his unhappiness!\n"+
		"If ever he have wife, let her he made\n"+
		"A miserable by the death of him\n"+
		"As I am made by my poor lord and thee!\n"+
		"Come, now towards Chertsey with your holy load,\n"+
		"Taken from Paul's to be interred there;\n"+
		"And still, as you are weary of the weight,\n"+
		"Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry's corse.\n"+
		"Enter GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"What black magician conjures up this fiend,\n"+
		"To stop devoted charitable deeds?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,\n"+
		"I'll make a corse of him that disobeys.\n"+
		"Gentleman\n"+
		"My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Unmanner'd dog! stand thou, when I command:\n"+
		"Advance thy halbert higher than my breast,\n"+
		"Or, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot,\n"+
		"And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"What, do you tremble? are you all afraid?\n"+
		"Alas, I blame you not; for you are mortal,\n"+
		"And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.\n"+
		"Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell!\n"+
		"Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,\n"+
		"His soul thou canst not have; therefore be gone.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"Foul devil, for God's sake, hence, and trouble us not;\n"+
		"For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell,\n"+
		"Fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.\n"+
		"If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,\n"+
		"Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.\n"+
		"O, gentlemen, see, see! dead Henry's wounds\n"+
		"Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh!\n"+
		"Blush, Blush, thou lump of foul deformity;\n"+
		"For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood\n"+
		"From cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells;\n"+
		"Thy deed, inhuman and unnatural,\n"+
		"Provokes this deluge most unnatural.\n"+
		"O God, which this blood madest, revenge his death!\n"+
		"O earth, which this blood drink'st revenge his death!\n"+
		"Either heaven with lightning strike the\n"+
		"murderer dead,\n"+
		"Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,\n"+
		"As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood\n"+
		"Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered!\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Lady, you know no rules of charity,\n"+
		"Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man:\n"+
		"No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"But I know none, and therefore am no beast.\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"More wonderful, when angels are so angry.\n"+
		"Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,\n"+
		"Of these supposed-evils, to give me leave,\n"+
		"By circumstance, but to acquit myself.\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"Vouchsafe, defused infection of a man,\n"+
		"For these known evils, but to give me leave,\n"+
		"By circumstance, to curse thy cursed self.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have\n"+
		"Some patient leisure to excuse myself.\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make\n"+
		"No excuse current, but to hang thyself.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"By such despair, I should accuse myself.\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"And, by despairing, shouldst thou stand excused;\n"+
		"For doing worthy vengeance on thyself,\n"+
		"Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Say that I slew them not?\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"Why, then they are not dead:\n"+
		"But dead they are, and devilish slave, by thee.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"I did not kill your husband.\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"Why, then he is alive.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Nay, he is dead; and slain by Edward's hand.\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw\n"+
		"Thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood;\n"+
		"The which thou once didst bend against her breast,\n"+
		"But that thy brothers beat aside the point.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"I was provoked by her slanderous tongue,\n"+
		"which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind.\n"+
		"Which never dreamt on aught but butcheries:\n"+
		"Didst thou not kill this king?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"I grant ye.\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"Dost grant me, hedgehog? then, God grant me too\n"+
		"Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!\n"+
		"O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"The fitter for the King of heaven, that hath him.\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Let him thank me, that holp to send him thither;\n"+
		"For he was fitter for that place than earth.\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"And thou unfit for any place but hell.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"Some dungeon.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Your bed-chamber.\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest!\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"So will it, madam till I lie with you.\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"I hope so.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,\n"+
		"To leave this keen encounter of our wits,\n"+
		"And fall somewhat into a slower method,\n"+
		"Is not the causer of the timeless deaths\n"+
		"Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,\n"+
		"As blameful as the executioner?\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"Thou art the cause, and most accursed effect.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Your beauty was the cause of that effect;\n"+
		"Your beauty: which did haunt me in my sleep\n"+
		"To undertake the death of all the world,\n"+
		"So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,\n"+
		"These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"These eyes could never endure sweet beauty's wreck;\n"+
		"You should not blemish it, if I stood by:\n"+
		"As all the world is cheered by the sun,\n"+
		"So I by that; it is my day, my life.\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Curse not thyself, fair creature thou art both.\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"I would I were, to be revenged on thee.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"It is a quarrel most unnatural,\n"+
		"To be revenged on him that loveth you.\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"It is a quarrel just and reasonable,\n"+
		"To be revenged on him that slew my husband.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband,\n"+
		"Did it to help thee to a better husband.\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"His better doth not breathe upon the earth.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"He lives that loves thee better than he could.\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"Name him.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Plantagenet.\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"Why, that was he.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"The selfsame name, but one of better nature.\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"Where is he?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Here.\n"+
		"She spitteth at him\n"+
		"Why dost thou spit at me?\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake!\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Never came poison from so sweet a place.\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"Never hung poison on a fouler toad.\n"+
		"Out of my sight! thou dost infect my eyes.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"Would they were basilisks, to strike thee dead!\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"I would they were, that I might die at once;\n"+
		"For now they kill me with a living death.\n"+
		"Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,\n"+
		"Shamed their aspect with store of childish drops:\n"+
		"These eyes that never shed remorseful tear,\n"+
		"No, when my father York and Edward wept,\n"+
		"To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made\n"+
		"When black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him;\n"+
		"Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,\n"+
		"Told the sad story of my father's death,\n"+
		"And twenty times made pause to sob and weep,\n"+
		"That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks\n"+
		"Like trees bedash'd with rain: in that sad time\n"+
		"My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;\n"+
		"And what these sorrows could not thence exhale,\n"+
		"Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.\n"+
		"I never sued to friend nor enemy;\n"+
		"My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;\n"+
		"But now thy beauty is proposed my fee,\n"+
		"My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.\n"+
		"She looks scornfully at him\n"+
		"Teach not thy lips such scorn, for they were made\n"+
		"For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.\n"+
		"If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,\n"+
		"Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;\n"+
		"Which if thou please to hide in this true bosom.\n"+
		"And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,\n"+
		"I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,\n"+
		"And humbly beg the death upon my knee.\n"+
		"He lays his breast open: she offers at it with his sword\n"+
		"Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry,\n"+
		"But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.\n"+
		"Nay, now dispatch; 'twas I that stabb'd young Edward,\n"+
		"But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.\n"+
		"Here she lets fall the sword\n"+
		"Take up the sword again, or take up me.\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"Arise, dissembler: though I wish thy death,\n"+
		"I will not be the executioner.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it.\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"I have already.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Tush, that was in thy rage:\n"+
		"Speak it again, and, even with the word,\n"+
		"That hand, which, for thy love, did kill thy love,\n"+
		"Shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love;\n"+
		"To both their deaths thou shalt be accessary.\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"I would I knew thy heart.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"'Tis figured in my tongue.\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"I fear me both are false.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Then never man was true.\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"Well, well, put up your sword.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Say, then, my peace is made.\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"That shall you know hereafter.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"But shall I live in hope?\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"All men, I hope, live so.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Vouchsafe to wear this ring.\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"To take is not to give.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Look, how this ring encompasseth finger.\n"+
		"Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;\n"+
		"Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.\n"+
		"And if thy poor devoted suppliant may\n"+
		"But beg one favour at thy gracious hand,\n"+
		"Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever.\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"What is it?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"That it would please thee leave these sad designs\n"+
		"To him that hath more cause to be a mourner,\n"+
		"And presently repair to Crosby Place;\n"+
		"Where, after I have solemnly interr'd\n"+
		"At Chertsey monastery this noble king,\n"+
		"And wet his grave with my repentant tears,\n"+
		"I will with all expedient duty see you:\n"+
		"For divers unknown reasons. I beseech you,\n"+
		"Grant me this boon.\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"With all my heart; and much it joys me too,\n"+
		"To see you are become so penitent.\n"+
		"Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Bid me farewell.\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"'Tis more than you deserve;\n"+
		"But since you teach me how to flatter you,\n"+
		"Imagine I have said farewell already.\n"+
		"Exeunt LADY ANNE, TRESSEL, and BERKELEY\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Sirs, take up the corse.\n"+
		"GENTLEMEN\n"+
		"Towards Chertsey, noble lord?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"No, to White-Friars; there attend my coining.\n"+
		"Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Was ever woman in this humour woo'd?\n"+
		"Was ever woman in this humour won?\n"+
		"I'll have her; but I will not keep her long.\n"+
		"What! I, that kill'd her husband and his father,\n"+
		"To take her in her heart's extremest hate,\n"+
		"With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,\n"+
		"The bleeding witness of her hatred by;\n"+
		"Having God, her conscience, and these bars\n"+
		"against me,\n"+
		"And I nothing to back my suit at all,\n"+
		"But the plain devil and dissembling looks,\n"+
		"And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!\n"+
		"Ha!\n"+
		"Hath she forgot already that brave prince,\n"+
		"Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,\n"+
		"Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury?\n"+
		"A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,\n"+
		"Framed in the prodigality of nature,\n"+
		"Young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal,\n"+
		"The spacious world cannot again afford\n"+
		"And will she yet debase her eyes on me,\n"+
		"That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince,\n"+
		"And made her widow to a woful bed?\n"+
		"On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety?\n"+
		"On me, that halt and am unshapen thus?\n"+
		"My dukedom to a beggarly denier,\n"+
		"I do mistake my person all this while:\n"+
		"Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot,\n"+
		"Myself to be a marvellous proper man.\n"+
		"I'll be at charges for a looking-glass,\n"+
		"And entertain some score or two of tailors,\n"+
		"To study fashions to adorn my body:\n"+
		"Since I am crept in favour with myself,\n"+
		"Will maintain it with some little cost.\n"+
		"But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave;\n"+
		"And then return lamenting to my love.\n"+
		"Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,\n"+
		"That I may see my shadow as I pass.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE III. The palace.\n"+
		"Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH, RIVERS, and GREY\n"+
		"RIVERS\n"+
		"Have patience, madam: there's no doubt his majesty\n"+
		"Will soon recover his accustom'd health.\n"+
		"GREY\n"+
		"In that you brook it in, it makes him worse:\n"+
		"Therefore, for God's sake, entertain good comfort,\n"+
		"And cheer his grace with quick and merry words.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"If he were dead, what would betide of me?\n"+
		"RIVERS\n"+
		"No other harm but loss of such a lord.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"The loss of such a lord includes all harm.\n"+
		"GREY\n"+
		"The heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son,\n"+
		"To be your comforter when he is gone.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"Oh, he is young and his minority\n"+
		"Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,\n"+
		"A man that loves not me, nor none of you.\n"+
		"RIVERS\n"+
		"Is it concluded that he shall be protector?\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"It is determined, not concluded yet:\n"+
		"But so it must be, if the king miscarry.\n"+
		"Enter BUCKINGHAM and DERBY\n"+
		"GREY\n"+
		"Here come the lords of Buckingham and Derby.\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Good time of day unto your royal grace!\n"+
		"DERBY\n"+
		"God make your majesty joyful as you have been!\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"The Countess Richmond, good my Lord of Derby.\n"+
		"To your good prayers will scarcely say amen.\n"+
		"Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she's your wife,\n"+
		"And loves not me, be you, good lord, assured\n"+
		"I hate not you for her proud arrogance.\n"+
		"DERBY\n"+
		"I do beseech you, either not believe\n"+
		"The envious slanders of her false accusers;\n"+
		"Or, if she be accused in true report,\n"+
		"Bear with her weakness, which, I think proceeds\n"+
		"From wayward sickness, and no grounded malice.\n"+
		"RIVERS\n"+
		"Saw you the king to-day, my Lord of Derby?\n"+
		"DERBY\n"+
		"But now the Duke of Buckingham and I\n"+
		"Are come from visiting his majesty.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"What likelihood of his amendment, lords?\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Madam, good hope; his grace speaks cheerfully.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"God grant him health! Did you confer with him?\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Madam, we did: he desires to make atonement\n"+
		"Betwixt the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,\n"+
		"And betwixt them and my lord chamberlain;\n"+
		"And sent to warn them to his royal presence.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"Would all were well! but that will never be\n"+
		"I fear our happiness is at the highest.\n"+
		"Enter GLOUCESTER, HASTINGS, and DORSET\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"They do me wrong, and I will not endure it:\n"+
		"Who are they that complain unto the king,\n"+
		"That I, forsooth, am stern, and love them not?\n"+
		"By holy Paul, they love his grace but lightly\n"+
		"That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours.\n"+
		"Because I cannot flatter and speak fair,\n"+
		"Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive and cog,\n"+
		"Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,\n"+
		"I must be held a rancorous enemy.\n"+
		"Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,\n"+
		"But thus his simple truth must be abused\n"+
		"By silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?\n"+
		"RIVERS\n"+
		"To whom in all this presence speaks your grace?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.\n"+
		"When have I injured thee? when done thee wrong?\n"+
		"Or thee? or thee? or any of your faction?\n"+
		"A plague upon you all! His royal person,--\n"+
		"Whom God preserve better than you would wish!--\n"+
		"Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing-while,\n"+
		"But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter.\n"+
		"The king, of his own royal disposition,\n"+
		"And not provoked by any suitor else;\n"+
		"Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred,\n"+
		"Which in your outward actions shows itself\n"+
		"Against my kindred, brothers, and myself,\n"+
		"Makes him to send; that thereby he may gather\n"+
		"The ground of your ill-will, and so remove it.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"I cannot tell: the world is grown so bad,\n"+
		"That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:\n"+
		"Since every Jack became a gentleman\n"+
		"There's many a gentle person made a Jack.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"Come, come, we know your meaning, brother\n"+
		"Gloucester;\n"+
		"You envy my advancement and my friends':\n"+
		"God grant we never may have need of you!\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Meantime, God grants that we have need of you:\n"+
		"Your brother is imprison'd by your means,\n"+
		"Myself disgraced, and the nobility\n"+
		"Held in contempt; whilst many fair promotions\n"+
		"Are daily given to ennoble those\n"+
		"That scarce, some two days since, were worth a noble.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"By Him that raised me to this careful height\n"+
		"From that contented hap which I enjoy'd,\n"+
		"I never did incense his majesty\n"+
		"Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been\n"+
		"An earnest advocate to plead for him.\n"+
		"My lord, you do me shameful injury,\n"+
		"Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"You may deny that you were not the cause\n"+
		"Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment.\n"+
		"RIVERS\n"+
		"She may, my lord, for--\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"She may, Lord Rivers! why, who knows not so?\n"+
		"She may do more, sir, than denying that:\n"+
		"She may help you to many fair preferments,\n"+
		"And then deny her aiding hand therein,\n"+
		"And lay those honours on your high deserts.\n"+
		"What may she not? She may, yea, marry, may she--\n"+
		"RIVERS\n"+
		"What, marry, may she?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"What, marry, may she! marry with a king,\n"+
		"A bachelor, a handsome stripling too:\n"+
		"I wis your grandam had a worser match.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne\n"+
		"Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs:\n"+
		"By heaven, I will acquaint his majesty\n"+
		"With those gross taunts I often have endured.\n"+
		"I had rather be a country servant-maid\n"+
		"Than a great queen, with this condition,\n"+
		"To be thus taunted, scorn'd, and baited at:\n"+
		"Enter QUEEN MARGARET, behind\n"+
		"Small joy have I in being England's queen.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"And lessen'd be that small, God, I beseech thee!\n"+
		"Thy honour, state and seat is due to me.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"What! threat you me with telling of the king?\n"+
		"Tell him, and spare not: look, what I have said\n"+
		"I will avouch in presence of the king:\n"+
		"I dare adventure to be sent to the Tower.\n"+
		"'Tis time to speak; my pains are quite forgot.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Out, devil! I remember them too well:\n"+
		"Thou slewest my husband Henry in the Tower,\n"+
		"And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,\n"+
		"I was a pack-horse in his great affairs;\n"+
		"A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,\n"+
		"A liberal rewarder of his friends:\n"+
		"To royalize his blood I spilt mine own.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Yea, and much better blood than his or thine.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"In all which time you and your husband Grey\n"+
		"Were factious for the house of Lancaster;\n"+
		"And, Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband\n"+
		"In Margaret's battle at Saint Alban's slain?\n"+
		"Let me put in your minds, if you forget,\n"+
		"What you have been ere now, and what you are;\n"+
		"Withal, what I have been, and what I am.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"A murderous villain, and so still thou art.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Poor Clarence did forsake his father, Warwick;\n"+
		"Yea, and forswore himself,--which Jesu pardon!--\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Which God revenge!\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"To fight on Edward's party for the crown;\n"+
		"And for his meed, poor lord, he is mew'd up.\n"+
		"I would to God my heart were flint, like Edward's;\n"+
		"Or Edward's soft and pitiful, like mine\n"+
		"I am too childish-foolish for this world.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Hie thee to hell for shame, and leave the world,\n"+
		"Thou cacodemon! there thy kingdom is.\n"+
		"RIVERS\n"+
		"My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days\n"+
		"Which here you urge to prove us enemies,\n"+
		"We follow'd then our lord, our lawful king:\n"+
		"So should we you, if you should be our king.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar:\n"+
		"Far be it from my heart, the thought of it!\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"As little joy, my lord, as you suppose\n"+
		"You should enjoy, were you this country's king,\n"+
		"As little joy may you suppose in me.\n"+
		"That I enjoy, being the queen thereof.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"A little joy enjoys the queen thereof;\n"+
		"For I am she, and altogether joyless.\n"+
		"I can no longer hold me patient.\n"+
		"Advancing\n"+
		"Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out\n"+
		"In sharing that which you have pill'd from me!\n"+
		"Which of you trembles not that looks on me?\n"+
		"If not, that, I being queen, you bow like subjects,\n"+
		"Yet that, by you deposed, you quake like rebels?\n"+
		"O gentle villain, do not turn away!\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Foul wrinkled witch, what makest thou in my sight?\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"But repetition of what thou hast marr'd;\n"+
		"That will I make before I let thee go.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Wert thou not banished on pain of death?\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"I was; but I do find more pain in banishment\n"+
		"Than death can yield me here by my abode.\n"+
		"A husband and a son thou owest to me;\n"+
		"And thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance:\n"+
		"The sorrow that I have, by right is yours,\n"+
		"And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"The curse my noble father laid on thee,\n"+
		"When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper\n"+
		"And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes,\n"+
		"And then, to dry them, gavest the duke a clout\n"+
		"Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland--\n"+
		"His curses, then from bitterness of soul\n"+
		"Denounced against thee, are all fall'n upon thee;\n"+
		"And God, not we, hath plagued thy bloody deed.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"So just is God, to right the innocent.\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"O, 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe,\n"+
		"And the most merciless that e'er was heard of!\n"+
		"RIVERS\n"+
		"Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.\n"+
		"DORSET\n"+
		"No man but prophesied revenge for it.\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Northumberland, then present, wept to see it.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"What were you snarling all before I came,\n"+
		"Ready to catch each other by the throat,\n"+
		"And turn you all your hatred now on me?\n"+
		"Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven?\n"+
		"That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death,\n"+
		"Their kingdom's loss, my woful banishment,\n"+
		"Could all but answer for that peevish brat?\n"+
		"Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?\n"+
		"Why, then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!\n"+
		"If not by war, by surfeit die your king,\n"+
		"As ours by murder, to make him a king!\n"+
		"Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,\n"+
		"For Edward my son, which was Prince of Wales,\n"+
		"Die in his youth by like untimely violence!\n"+
		"Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,\n"+
		"Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!\n"+
		"Long mayst thou live to wail thy children's loss;\n"+
		"And see another, as I see thee now,\n"+
		"Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine!\n"+
		"Long die thy happy days before thy death;\n"+
		"And, after many lengthen'd hours of grief,\n"+
		"Die neither mother, wife, nor England's queen!\n"+
		"Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by,\n"+
		"And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son\n"+
		"Was stabb'd with bloody daggers: God, I pray him,\n"+
		"That none of you may live your natural age,\n"+
		"But by some unlook'd accident cut off!\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd hag!\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"And leave out thee? stay, dog, for thou shalt hear me.\n"+
		"If heaven have any grievous plague in store\n"+
		"Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,\n"+
		"O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe,\n"+
		"And then hurl down their indignation\n"+
		"On thee, the troubler of the poor world's peace!\n"+
		"The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul!\n"+
		"Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livest,\n"+
		"And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends!\n"+
		"No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine,\n"+
		"Unless it be whilst some tormenting dream\n"+
		"Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils!\n"+
		"Thou elvish-mark'd, abortive, rooting hog!\n"+
		"Thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity\n"+
		"The slave of nature and the son of hell!\n"+
		"Thou slander of thy mother's heavy womb!\n"+

		"Richard!\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Ha!\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"I call thee not.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"I cry thee mercy then, for I had thought\n"+
		"That thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Why, so I did; but look'd for no reply.\n"+
		"O, let me make the period to my curse!\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"'Tis done by me, and ends in 'Margaret.'\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my fortune!\n"+
		"Why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider,\n"+
		"Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?\n"+
		"Fool, fool! thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself.\n"+
		"The time will come when thou shalt wish for me\n"+
		"To help thee curse that poisonous bunchback'd toad.\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse,\n"+
		"Lest to thy harm thou move our patience.\n"+

		"Foul shame upon you! you have all moved mine.\n"+
		"RIVERS\n"+
		"Were you well served, you would be taught your duty.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"To serve me well, you all should do me duty,\n"+
		"Teach me to be your queen, and you my subjects:\n"+
		"O, serve me well, and teach yourselves that duty!\n"+
		"DORSET\n"+
		"Dispute not with her; she is lunatic.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Peace, master marquess, you are malapert:\n"+
		"Your fire-new stamp of honour is scarce current.\n"+
		"O, that your young nobility could judge\n"+
		"What 'twere to lose it, and be miserable!\n"+
		"They that stand high have many blasts to shake them;\n"+
		"And if they fall, they dash themselves to pieces.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Good counsel, marry: learn it, learn it, marquess.\n"+
		"DORSET\n"+
		"It toucheth you, my lord, as much as me.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Yea, and much more: but I was born so high,\n"+
		"Our aery buildeth in the cedar's top,\n"+
		"And dallies with the wind and scorns the sun.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"And turns the sun to shade; alas! alas!\n"+
		"Witness my son, now in the shade of death;\n"+
		"Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath\n"+
		"Hath in eternal darkness folded up.\n"+
		"Your aery buildeth in our aery's nest.\n"+
		"O God, that seest it, do not suffer it!\n"+
		"As it was won with blood, lost be it so!\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Have done! for shame, if not for charity.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Urge neither charity nor shame to me:\n"+
		"Uncharitably with me have you dealt,\n"+
		"And shamefully by you my hopes are butcher'd.\n"+
		"My charity is outrage, life my shame\n"+
		"And in that shame still live my sorrow's rage.\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Have done, have done.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"O princely Buckingham I'll kiss thy hand,\n"+
		"In sign of league and amity with thee:\n"+
		"Now fair befal thee and thy noble house!\n"+
		"Thy garments are not spotted with our blood,\n"+
		"Nor thou within the compass of my curse.\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Nor no one here; for curses never pass\n"+
		"The lips of those that breathe them in the air.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"I'll not believe but they ascend the sky,\n"+
		"And there awake God's gentle-sleeping peace.\n"+
		"O Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog!\n"+
		"Look, when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites,\n"+
		"His venom tooth will rankle to the death:\n"+
		"Have not to do with him, beware of him;\n"+
		"Sin, death, and hell have set their marks on him,\n"+

		"What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham?\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel?\n"+
		"And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?\n"+
		"O, but remember this another day,\n"+
		"When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow,\n"+

		"Marry, as for Clarence, he is well repaid,\n"+
		"He is frank'd up to fatting for his pains\n"+
		"God pardon them that are the cause of it!\n"+

		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.\n"+
		"The secret mischiefs that I set abroach\n"+
		"I lay unto the grievous charge of others.\n"+
		"Clarence, whom I, indeed, have laid in darkness,\n"+
		"I do beweep to many simple gulls\n"+
		"Namely, to Hastings, Derby, Buckingham;\n"+
		"And say it is the queen and her allies\n"+
		"That stir the king against the duke my brother.\n"+
		"Now, they believe it; and withal whet me\n"+
		"To be revenged on Rivers, Vaughan, Grey:\n"+
		"But then I sigh; and, with a piece of scripture,\n"+
		"Tell them that God bids us do good for evil:\n"+
		"And thus I clothe my naked villany\n"+
		"With old odd ends stolen out of holy writ;\n"+
		"And seem a saint, when most I play the devil.\n"+
		"Enter two Murderers\n"+
		"But, soft! here come my executioners.\n"+
		"How now, my hardy, stout resolved mates!\n"+
		"Are you now going to dispatch this deed?\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"We are, my lord; and come to have the warrant\n"+
		"That we may be admitted where he is.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Well thought upon; I have it here about me.\n"+
		"Gives the warrant\n"+
		"When you have done, repair to Crosby Place.\n"+
		"But, sirs, be sudden in the execution,\n"+
		"Withal obdurate, do not hear him plead;\n"+
		"For Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps\n"+
		"May move your hearts to pity if you mark him.\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"Tush!\n"+
		"Fear not, my lord, we will not stand to prate;\n"+
		"Talkers are no good doers: be assured\n"+
		"We come to use our hands and not our tongues.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Your eyes drop millstones, when fools' eyes drop tears:\n"+

		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV. London. The Tower.\n"+
		"Enter CLARENCE and BRAKENBURY\n"+
		"BRAKENBURY\n"+
		"Why looks your grace so heavily today?\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"O, I have pass'd a miserable night,\n"+
		"So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,\n"+
		"That, as I am a Christian faithful man,\n"+
		"I would not spend another such a night,\n"+
		"Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days,\n"+
		"So full of dismal terror was the time!\n"+
		"BRAKENBURY\n"+
		"What was your dream? I long to hear you tell it.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower,\n"+
		"And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy;\n"+
		"And, in my company, my brother Gloucester;\n"+
		"Who from my cabin tempted me to walk\n"+
		"Upon the hatches: thence we looked toward England,\n"+
		"And cited up a thousand fearful times,\n"+
		"During the wars of York and Lancaster\n"+
		"That had befall'n us. As we paced along\n"+
		"Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,\n"+
		"Methought that Gloucester stumbled; and, in falling,\n"+
		"Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard,\n"+
		"Into the tumbling billows of the main.\n"+
		"Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!\n"+
		"What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!\n"+
		"What ugly sights of death within mine eyes!\n"+
		"Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;\n"+
		"Ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon;\n"+
		"Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,\n"+
		"Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,\n"+
		"All scatter'd in the bottom of the sea:\n"+
		"Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes\n"+
		"Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,\n"+
		"As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,\n"+
		"Which woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep,\n"+
		"And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by.\n"+
		"BRAKENBURY\n"+
		"Had you such leisure in the time of death\n"+
		"To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"Methought I had; and often did I strive\n"+
		"To yield the ghost: but still the envious flood\n"+
		"Kept in my soul, and would not let it forth\n"+
		"To seek the empty, vast and wandering air;\n"+
		"But smother'd it within my panting bulk,\n"+
		"Which almost burst to belch it in the sea.\n"+
		"BRAKENBURY\n"+
		"Awaked you not with this sore agony?\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"O, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life;\n"+
		"O, then began the tempest to my soul,\n"+
		"Who pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood,\n"+
		"With that grim ferryman which poets write of,\n"+
		"Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.\n"+
		"The first that there did greet my stranger soul,\n"+
		"Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick;\n"+
		"Who cried aloud, 'What scourge for perjury\n"+
		"Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?'\n"+
		"And so he vanish'd: then came wandering by\n"+
		"A shadow like an angel, with bright hair\n"+
		"Dabbled in blood; and he squeak'd out aloud,\n"+
		"'Clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,\n"+
		"That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury;\n"+
		"Seize on him, Furies, take him to your torments!'\n"+
		"With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends\n"+
		"Environ'd me about, and howled in mine ears\n"+
		"Such hideous cries, that with the very noise\n"+
		"I trembling waked, and for a season after\n"+
		"Could not believe but that I was in hell,\n"+
		"Such terrible impression made the dream.\n"+
		"BRAKENBURY\n"+
		"No marvel, my lord, though it affrighted you;\n"+
		"I promise, I am afraid to hear you tell it.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"O Brakenbury, I have done those things,\n"+
		"Which now bear evidence against my soul,\n"+
		"For Edward's sake; and see how he requites me!\n"+
		"O God! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,\n"+
		"But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,\n"+
		"Yet execute thy wrath in me alone,\n"+
		"O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!\n"+
		"I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;\n"+
		"My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.\n"+
		"BRAKENBURY\n"+
		"I will, my lord: God give your grace good rest!\n"+
		"CLARENCE sleeps\n"+
		"Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,\n"+
		"Makes the night morning, and the noon-tide night.\n"+
		"Princes have but their tides for their glories,\n"+
		"An outward honour for an inward toil;\n"+
		"And, for unfelt imagination,\n"+
		"They often feel a world of restless cares:\n"+
		"So that, betwixt their tides and low names,\n"+
		"There's nothing differs but the outward fame.\n"+
		"Enter the two Murderers\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"Ho! who's here?\n"+
		"BRAKENBURY\n"+
		"In God's name what are you, and how came you hither?\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"I would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on my legs.\n"+
		"BRAKENBURY\n"+
		"Yea, are you so brief?\n"+
		"Second Murderer\n"+
		"O sir, it is better to be brief than tedious. Show\n"+
		"him our commission; talk no more.\n"+
		"BRAKENBURY reads it\n"+
		"BRAKENBURY\n"+
		"I am, in this, commanded to deliver\n"+
		"The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands:\n"+
		"I will not reason what is meant hereby,\n"+
		"Because I will be guiltless of the meaning.\n"+
		"Here are the keys, there sits the duke asleep:\n"+
		"I'll to the king; and signify to him\n"+
		"That thus I have resign'd my charge to you.\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"Do so, it is a point of wisdom: fare you well.\n"+
		"Exit BRAKENBURY\n"+
		"Second Murderer\n"+
		"What, shall we stab him as he sleeps?\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"No; then he will say 'twas done cowardly, when he wakes.\n"+
		"Second Murderer\n"+
		"When he wakes! why, fool, he shall never wake till\n"+
		"the judgment-day.\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"Why, then he will say we stabbed him sleeping.\n"+
		"Second Murderer\n"+
		"The urging of that word 'judgment' hath bred a kind\n"+
		"of remorse in me.\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"What, art thou afraid?\n"+
		"Second Murderer\n"+
		"Not to kill him, having a warrant for it; but to be\n"+
		"damned for killing him, from which no warrant can defend us.\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"I thought thou hadst been resolute.\n"+
		"Second Murderer\n"+
		"So I am, to let him live.\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"Back to the Duke of Gloucester, tell him so.\n"+
		"Second Murderer\n"+
		"I pray thee, stay a while: I hope my holy humour\n"+
		"will change; 'twas wont to hold me but while one\n"+
		"would tell twenty.\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"How dost thou feel thyself now?\n"+
		"Second Murderer\n"+
		"'Faith, some certain dregs of conscience are yet\n"+
		"within me.\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"Remember our reward, when the deed is done.\n"+
		"Second Murderer\n"+
		"'Zounds, he dies: I had forgot the reward.\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"Where is thy conscience now?\n"+
		"Second Murderer\n"+
		"In the Duke of Gloucester's purse.\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"So when he opens his purse to give us our reward,\n"+
		"thy conscience flies out.\n"+
		"Second Murderer\n"+
		"Let it go; there's few or none will entertain it.\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"How if it come to thee again?\n"+
		"Second Murderer\n"+
		"I'll not meddle with it: it is a dangerous thing: it\n"+
		"makes a man a coward: a man cannot steal, but it\n"+
		"accuseth him; he cannot swear, but it cheques him;\n"+
		"he cannot lie with his neighbour's wife, but it\n"+
		"detects him: 'tis a blushing shamefast spirit that\n"+
		"mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills one full of\n"+
		"obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold\n"+
		"that I found; it beggars any man that keeps it: it\n"+
		"is turned out of all towns and cities for a\n"+
		"dangerous thing; and every man that means to live\n"+
		"well endeavours to trust to himself and to live\n"+
		"without it.\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"'Zounds, it is even now at my elbow, persuading me\n"+
		"not to kill the duke.\n"+
		"Second Murderer\n"+
		"Take the devil in thy mind, and relieve him not: he\n"+
		"would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh.\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"Tut, I am strong-framed, he cannot prevail with me,\n"+
		"I warrant thee.\n"+
		"Second Murderer\n"+
		"Spoke like a tail fellow that respects his\n"+
		"reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"Take him over the costard with the hilts of thy\n"+
		"sword, and then we will chop him in the malmsey-butt\n"+
		"in the next room.\n"+
		"Second Murderer\n"+
		"O excellent devise! make a sop of him.\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"Hark! he stirs: shall I strike?\n"+
		"Second Murderer\n"+
		"No, first let's reason with him.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"Where art thou, keeper? give me a cup of wine.\n"+
		"Second murderer\n"+
		"You shall have wine enough, my lord, anon.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"In God's name, what art thou?\n"+
		"Second Murderer\n"+
		"A man, as you are.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"But not, as I am, royal.\n"+
		"Second Murderer\n"+
		"Nor you, as we are, loyal.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.\n"+
		"Second Murderer\n"+
		"My voice is now the king's, my looks mine own.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!\n"+
		"Your eyes do menace me: why look you pale?\n"+
		"Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?\n"+
		"Both\n"+
		"To, to, to--\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"To murder me?\n"+
		"Both\n"+
		"Ay, ay.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,\n"+
		"And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.\n"+
		"Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"Offended us you have not, but the king.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"I shall be reconciled to him again.\n"+
		"Second Murderer\n"+
		"Never, my lord; therefore prepare to die.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"Are you call'd forth from out a world of men\n"+
		"To slay the innocent? What is my offence?\n"+
		"Where are the evidence that do accuse me?\n"+
		"What lawful quest have given their verdict up\n"+
		"Unto the frowning judge? or who pronounced\n"+
		"The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death?\n"+
		"Before I be convict by course of law,\n"+
		"To threaten me with death is most unlawful.\n"+
		"I charge you, as you hope to have redemption\n"+
		"By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins,\n"+
		"That you depart and lay no hands on me\n"+
		"The deed you undertake is damnable.\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"What we will do, we do upon command.\n"+
		"Second Murderer\n"+
		"And he that hath commanded is the king.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"Erroneous vassal! the great King of kings\n"+
		"Hath in the tables of his law commanded\n"+
		"That thou shalt do no murder: and wilt thou, then,\n"+
		"Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?\n"+
		"Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hands,\n"+
		"To hurl upon their heads that break his law.\n"+
		"Second Murderer\n"+
		"And that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee,\n"+
		"For false forswearing and for murder too:\n"+
		"Thou didst receive the holy sacrament,\n"+
		"To fight in quarrel of the house of Lancaster.\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"And, like a traitor to the name of God,\n"+
		"Didst break that vow; and with thy treacherous blade\n"+
		"Unrip'dst the bowels of thy sovereign's son.\n"+
		"Second Murderer\n"+
		"Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend.\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"How canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us,\n"+
		"When thou hast broke it in so dear degree?\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?\n"+
		"For Edward, for my brother, for his sake: Why, sirs,\n"+
		"He sends ye not to murder me for this\n"+
		"For in this sin he is as deep as I.\n"+
		"If God will be revenged for this deed.\n"+
		"O, know you yet, he doth it publicly,\n"+
		"Take not the quarrel from his powerful arm;\n"+
		"He needs no indirect nor lawless course\n"+
		"To cut off those that have offended him.\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"Who made thee, then, a bloody minister,\n"+
		"When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet,\n"+
		"That princely novice, was struck dead by thee?\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"My brother's love, the devil, and my rage.\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"Thy brother's love, our duty, and thy fault,\n"+
		"Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"Oh, if you love my brother, hate not me;\n"+
		"I am his brother, and I love him well.\n"+
		"If you be hired for meed, go back again,\n"+
		"And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,\n"+
		"Who shall reward you better for my life\n"+
		"Than Edward will for tidings of my death.\n"+
		"Second Murderer\n"+
		"You are deceived, your brother Gloucester hates you.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear:\n"+
		"Go you to him from me.\n"+
		"Both\n"+
		"Ay, so we will.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"Tell him, when that our princely father York\n"+
		"Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm,\n"+
		"And charged us from his soul to love each other,\n"+
		"He little thought of this divided friendship:\n"+
		"Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"Ay, millstones; as be lesson'd us to weep.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"O, do not slander him, for he is kind.\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"Right,\n"+
		"As snow in harvest. Thou deceivest thyself:\n"+
		"'Tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"It cannot be; for when I parted with him,\n"+
		"He hugg'd me in his arms, and swore, with sobs,\n"+
		"That he would labour my delivery.\n"+
		"Second Murderer\n"+
		"Why, so he doth, now he delivers thee\n"+
		"From this world's thraldom to the joys of heaven.\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"Hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul,\n"+
		"To counsel me to make my peace with God,\n"+
		"And art thou yet to thy own soul so blind,\n"+
		"That thou wilt war with God by murdering me?\n"+
		"Ah, sirs, consider, he that set you on\n"+
		"To do this deed will hate you for the deed.\n"+
		"Second Murderer\n"+
		"What shall we do?\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"Relent, and save your souls.\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"Relent! 'tis cowardly and womanish.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish.\n"+
		"Which of you, if you were a prince's son,\n"+
		"Being pent from liberty, as I am now,\n"+
		"if two such murderers as yourselves came to you,\n"+
		"Would not entreat for life?\n"+
		"My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks:\n"+
		"O, if thine eye be not a flatterer,\n"+
		"Come thou on my side, and entreat for me,\n"+
		"As you would beg, were you in my distress\n"+
		"A begging prince what beggar pities not?\n"+
		"Second Murderer\n"+
		"Look behind you, my lord.\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"Take that, and that: if all this will not do,\n"+
		"Stabs him\n"+
		"I'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within.\n"+
		"Exit, with the body\n"+
		"Second Murderer\n"+
		"A bloody deed, and desperately dispatch'd!\n"+
		"How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands\n"+
		"Of this most grievous guilty murder done!\n"+
		"Re-enter First Murderer\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"How now! what mean'st thou, that thou help'st me not?\n"+
		"By heavens, the duke shall know how slack thou art!\n"+
		"Second Murderer\n"+
		"I would he knew that I had saved his brother!\n"+
		"Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say;\n"+
		"For I repent me that the duke is slain.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"So do not I: go, coward as thou art.\n"+
		"Now must I hide his body in some hole,\n"+
		"Until the duke take order for his burial:\n"+
		"And when I have my meed, I must away;\n"+
		"For this will out, and here I must not stay.\n"+
		"ACT II\n"+
		"SCENE I. London. The palace.\n"+
		"Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV sick, QUEEN ELIZABETH, DORSET, RIVERS, HASTINGS, BUCKINGHAM, GREY, and others\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Why, so: now have I done a good day's work:\n"+
		"You peers, continue this united league:\n"+
		"I every day expect an embassage\n"+
		"From my Redeemer to redeem me hence;\n"+
		"And now in peace my soul shall part to heaven,\n"+
		"Since I have set my friends at peace on earth.\n"+
		"Rivers and Hastings, take each other's hand;\n"+
		"Dissemble not your hatred, swear your love.\n"+
		"RIVERS\n"+
		"By heaven, my heart is purged from grudging hate:\n"+
		"And with my hand I seal my true heart's love.\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"So thrive I, as I truly swear the like!\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Take heed you dally not before your king;\n"+
		"Lest he that is the supreme King of kings\n"+
		"Confound your hidden falsehood, and award\n"+
		"Either of you to be the other's end.\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"So prosper I, as I swear perfect love!\n"+
		"RIVERS\n"+
		"And I, as I love Hastings with my heart!\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Madam, yourself are not exempt in this,\n"+
		"Nor your son Dorset, Buckingham, nor you;\n"+
		"You have been factious one against the other,\n"+
		"Wife, love Lord Hastings, let him kiss your hand;\n"+
		"And what you do, do it unfeignedly.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"Here, Hastings; I will never more remember\n"+
		"Our former hatred, so thrive I and mine!\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Dorset, embrace him; Hastings, love lord marquess.\n"+
		"DORSET\n"+
		"This interchange of love, I here protest,\n"+
		"Upon my part shall be unviolable.\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"And so swear I, my lord\n"+
		"They embrace\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Now, princely Buckingham, seal thou this league\n"+
		"With thy embracements to my wife's allies,\n"+
		"And make me happy in your unity.\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Whenever Buckingham doth turn his hate\n"+
		"On you or yours,\n"+
		"To the Queen\n"+
		"but with all duteous love\n"+
		"Doth cherish you and yours, God punish me\n"+
		"With hate in those where I expect most love!\n"+
		"When I have most need to employ a friend,\n"+
		"And most assured that he is a friend\n"+
		"Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile,\n"+
		"Be he unto me! this do I beg of God,\n"+
		"When I am cold in zeal to yours.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham,\n"+
		"is this thy vow unto my sickly heart.\n"+
		"There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here,\n"+
		"To make the perfect period of this peace.\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"And, in good time, here comes the noble duke.\n"+
		"Enter GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen:\n"+
		"And, princely peers, a happy time of day!\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Happy, indeed, as we have spent the day.\n"+
		"Brother, we done deeds of charity;\n"+
		"Made peace enmity, fair love of hate,\n"+
		"Between these swelling wrong-incensed peers.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"A blessed labour, my most sovereign liege:\n"+
		"Amongst this princely heap, if any here,\n"+
		"By false intelligence, or wrong surmise,\n"+
		"Hold me a foe;\n"+
		"If I unwittingly, or in my rage,\n"+
		"Have aught committed that is hardly borne\n"+
		"By any in this presence, I desire\n"+
		"To reconcile me to his friendly peace:\n"+
		"'Tis death to me to be at enmity;\n"+
		"I hate it, and desire all good men's love.\n"+
		"First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,\n"+
		"Which I will purchase with my duteous service;\n"+
		"Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham,\n"+
		"If ever any grudge were lodged between us;\n"+
		"Of you, Lord Rivers, and, Lord Grey, of you;\n"+
		"That without desert have frown'd on me;\n"+
		"Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen; indeed, of all.\n"+
		"I do not know that Englishman alive\n"+
		"With whom my soul is any jot at odds\n"+
		"More than the infant that is born to-night\n"+
		"I thank my God for my humility.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"A holy day shall this be kept hereafter:\n"+
		"I would to God all strifes were well compounded.\n"+
		"My sovereign liege, I do beseech your majesty\n"+
		"To take our brother Clarence to your grace.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Why, madam, have I offer'd love for this\n"+
		"To be so bouted in this royal presence?\n"+
		"Who knows not that the noble duke is dead?\n"+
		"They all start\n"+
		"You do him injury to scorn his corse.\n"+
		"RIVERS\n"+
		"Who knows not he is dead! who knows he is?\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"All seeing heaven, what a world is this!\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?\n"+
		"DORSET\n"+
		"Ay, my good lord; and no one in this presence\n"+
		"But his red colour hath forsook his cheeks.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Is Clarence dead? the order was reversed.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"But he, poor soul, by your first order died,\n"+
		"And that a winged Mercury did bear:\n"+
		"Some tardy cripple bore the countermand,\n"+
		"That came too lag to see him buried.\n"+
		"God grant that some, less noble and less loyal,\n"+
		"Nearer in bloody thoughts, but not in blood,\n"+
		"Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did,\n"+
		"And yet go current from suspicion!\n"+
		"Enter DERBY\n"+
		"DERBY\n"+
		"A boon, my sovereign, for my service done!\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"I pray thee, peace: my soul is full of sorrow.\n"+
		"DERBY\n"+
		"I will not rise, unless your highness grant.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Then speak at once what is it thou demand'st.\n"+
		"DERBY\n"+
		"The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life;\n"+
		"Who slew to-day a righteous gentleman\n"+
		"Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Have a tongue to doom my brother's death,\n"+
		"And shall the same give pardon to a slave?\n"+
		"My brother slew no man; his fault was thought,\n"+
		"And yet his punishment was cruel death.\n"+
		"Who sued to me for him? who, in my rage,\n"+
		"Kneel'd at my feet, and bade me be advised\n"+
		"Who spake of brotherhood? who spake of love?\n"+
		"Who told me how the poor soul did forsake\n"+
		"The mighty Warwick, and did fight for me?\n"+
		"Who told me, in the field by Tewksbury\n"+
		"When Oxford had me down, he rescued me,\n"+
		"And said, 'Dear brother, live, and be a king'?\n"+
		"Who told me, when we both lay in the field\n"+
		"Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me\n"+
		"Even in his own garments, and gave himself,\n"+
		"All thin and naked, to the numb cold night?\n"+
		"All this from my remembrance brutish wrath\n"+
		"Sinfully pluck'd, and not a man of you\n"+
		"Had so much grace to put it in my mind.\n"+
		"But when your carters or your waiting-vassals\n"+
		"Have done a drunken slaughter, and defaced\n"+
		"The precious image of our dear Redeemer,\n"+
		"You straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon;\n"+
		"And I unjustly too, must grant it you\n"+
		"But for my brother not a man would speak,\n"+
		"Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself\n"+
		"For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all\n"+
		"Have been beholding to him in his life;\n"+
		"Yet none of you would once plead for his life.\n"+
		"O God, I fear thy justice will take hold\n"+
		"On me, and you, and mine, and yours for this!\n"+
		"Come, Hastings, help me to my closet.\n"+
		"Oh, poor Clarence!\n"+
		"Exeunt some with KING EDWARD IV and QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"This is the fruit of rashness! Mark'd you not\n"+
		"How that the guilty kindred of the queen\n"+
		"Look'd pale when they did hear of Clarence' death?\n"+
		"O, they did urge it still unto the king!\n"+
		"God will revenge it. But come, let us in,\n"+
		"To comfort Edward with our company.\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"We wait upon your grace.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. The palace.\n"+
		"Enter the DUCHESS OF YORK, with the two children of CLARENCE\n"+
		"Boy\n"+
		"Tell me, good grandam, is our father dead?\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"No, boy.\n"+
		"Boy\n"+
		"Why do you wring your hands, and beat your breast,\n"+
		"And cry 'O Clarence, my unhappy son!'\n"+
		"Girl\n"+
		"Why do you look on us, and shake your head,\n"+
		"And call us wretches, orphans, castaways\n"+
		"If that our noble father be alive?\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"My pretty cousins, you mistake me much;\n"+
		"I do lament the sickness of the king.\n"+
		"As loath to lose him, not your father's death;\n"+
		"It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost.\n"+
		"Boy\n"+
		"Then, grandam, you conclude that he is dead.\n"+
		"The king my uncle is to blame for this:\n"+
		"God will revenge it; whom I will importune\n"+
		"With daily prayers all to that effect.\n"+
		"Girl\n"+
		"And so will I.\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"Peace, children, peace! the king doth love you well:\n"+
		"Incapable and shallow innocents,\n"+
		"You cannot guess who caused your father's death.\n"+
		"Boy\n"+
		"Grandam, we can; for my good uncle Gloucester\n"+
		"Told me, the king, provoked by the queen,\n"+
		"Devised impeachments to imprison him :\n"+
		"And when my uncle told me so, he wept,\n"+
		"And hugg'd me in his arm, and kindly kiss'd my cheek;\n"+
		"Bade me rely on him as on my father,\n"+
		"And he would love me dearly as his child.\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"Oh, that deceit should steal such gentle shapes,\n"+
		"And with a virtuous vizard hide foul guile!\n"+
		"He is my son; yea, and therein my shame;\n"+
		"Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.\n"+
		"Boy\n"+
		"Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam?\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"Ay, boy.\n"+
		"Boy\n"+
		"I cannot think it. Hark! what noise is this?\n"+
		"Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH, with her hair about her ears; RIVERS, and DORSET after her\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"Oh, who shall hinder me to wail and weep,\n"+
		"To chide my fortune, and torment myself?\n"+
		"I'll join with black despair against my soul,\n"+
		"And to myself become an enemy.\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"What means this scene of rude impatience?\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"To make an act of tragic violence:\n"+
		"Edward, my lord, your son, our king, is dead.\n"+
		"Why grow the branches now the root is wither'd?\n"+
		"Why wither not the leaves the sap being gone?\n"+
		"If you will live, lament; if die, be brief,\n"+
		"That our swift-winged souls may catch the king's;\n"+
		"Or, like obedient subjects, follow him\n"+
		"To his new kingdom of perpetual rest.\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow\n"+
		"As I had title in thy noble husband!\n"+
		"I have bewept a worthy husband's death,\n"+
		"And lived by looking on his images:\n"+
		"But now two mirrors of his princely semblance\n"+
		"Are crack'd in pieces by malignant death,\n"+
		"And I for comfort have but one false glass,\n"+
		"Which grieves me when I see my shame in him.\n"+
		"Thou art a widow; yet thou art a mother,\n"+
		"And hast the comfort of thy children left thee:\n"+
		"But death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms,\n"+
		"And pluck'd two crutches from my feeble limbs,\n"+
		"Edward and Clarence. O, what cause have I,\n"+
		"Thine being but a moiety of my grief,\n"+
		"To overgo thy plaints and drown thy cries!\n"+
		"Boy\n"+
		"Good aunt, you wept not for our father's death;\n"+
		"How can we aid you with our kindred tears?\n"+
		"Girl\n"+
		"Our fatherless distress was left unmoan'd;\n"+
		"Your widow-dolour likewise be unwept!\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"Give me no help in lamentation;\n"+
		"I am not barren to bring forth complaints\n"+
		"All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes,\n"+
		"That I, being govern'd by the watery moon,\n"+
		"May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world!\n"+
		"Oh for my husband, for my dear lord Edward!\n"+
		"Children\n"+
		"Oh for our father, for our dear lord Clarence!\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"What stay had I but Edward? and he's gone.\n"+
		"Children\n"+
		"What stay had we but Clarence? and he's gone.\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"What stays had I but they? and they are gone.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"Was never widow had so dear a loss!\n"+
		"Children\n"+
		"Were never orphans had so dear a loss!\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"Was never mother had so dear a loss!\n"+
		"Alas, I am the mother of these moans!\n"+
		"Their woes are parcell'd, mine are general.\n"+
		"She for an Edward weeps, and so do I;\n"+
		"I for a Clarence weep, so doth not she:\n"+
		"These babes for Clarence weep and so do I;\n"+
		"I for an Edward weep, so do not they:\n"+
		"Alas, you three, on me, threefold distress'd,\n"+
		"Pour all your tears! I am your sorrow's nurse,\n"+
		"And I will pamper it with lamentations.\n"+
		"DORSET\n"+
		"Comfort, dear mother: God is much displeased\n"+
		"That you take with unthankfulness, his doing:\n"+
		"In common worldly things, 'tis call'd ungrateful,\n"+
		"With dull unwilligness to repay a debt\n"+
		"Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent;\n"+
		"Much more to be thus opposite with heaven,\n"+
		"For it requires the royal debt it lent you.\n"+
		"RIVERS\n"+
		"Madam, bethink you, like a careful mother,\n"+
		"Of the young prince your son: send straight for him\n"+
		"Let him be crown'd; in him your comfort lives:\n"+
		"Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward's grave,\n"+
		"And plant your joys in living Edward's throne.\n"+
		"Enter GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM, DERBY, HASTINGS, and RATCLIFF\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Madam, have comfort: all of us have cause\n"+
		"To wail the dimming of our shining star;\n"+
		"But none can cure their harms by wailing them.\n"+
		"Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy;\n"+
		"I did not see your grace: humbly on my knee\n"+
		"I crave your blessing.\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"God bless thee; and put meekness in thy mind,\n"+
		"Love, charity, obedience, and true duty!\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"[Aside] Amen; and make me die a good old man!\n"+
		"That is the butt-end of a mother's blessing:\n"+
		"I marvel why her grace did leave it out.\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers,\n"+
		"That bear this mutual heavy load of moan,\n"+
		"Now cheer each other in each other's love\n"+
		"Though we have spent our harvest of this king,\n"+
		"We are to reap the harvest of his son.\n"+
		"The broken rancour of your high-swoln hearts,\n"+
		"But lately splinter'd, knit, and join'd together,\n"+
		"Must gently be preserved, cherish'd, and kept:\n"+
		"Me seemeth good, that, with some little train,\n"+
		"Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fetch'd\n"+
		"Hither to London, to be crown'd our king.\n"+
		"RIVERS\n"+
		"Why with some little train, my Lord of Buckingham?\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Marry, my lord, lest, by a multitude,\n"+
		"The new-heal'd wound of malice should break out,\n"+
		"Which would be so much the more dangerous\n"+
		"By how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd:\n"+
		"Where every horse bears his commanding rein,\n"+
		"And may direct his course as please himself,\n"+
		"As well the fear of harm, as harm apparent,\n"+
		"In my opinion, ought to be prevented.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"I hope the king made peace with all of us\n"+
		"And the compact is firm and true in me.\n"+
		"RIVERS\n"+
		"And so in me; and so, I think, in all:\n"+
		"Yet, since it is but green, it should be put\n"+
		"To no apparent likelihood of breach,\n"+
		"Which haply by much company might be urged:\n"+
		"Therefore I say with noble Buckingham,\n"+
		"That it is meet so few should fetch the prince.\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"And so say I.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Then be it so; and go we to determine\n"+
		"Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow.\n"+
		"Madam, and you, my mother, will you go\n"+
		"To give your censures in this weighty business?\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"With all our harts.\n"+
		"Exeunt all but BUCKINGHAM and GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"My lord, whoever journeys to the Prince,\n"+
		"For God's sake, let not us two be behind;\n"+
		"For, by the way, I'll sort occasion,\n"+
		"As index to the story we late talk'd of,\n"+
		"To part the queen's proud kindred from the king.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"My other self, my counsel's consistory,\n"+
		"My oracle, my prophet! My dear cousin,\n"+
		"I, like a child, will go by thy direction.\n"+
		"Towards Ludlow then, for we'll not stay behind.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. London. A street.\n"+
		"Enter two Citizens meeting\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"Neighbour, well met: whither away so fast?\n"+
		"Second Citizen\n"+
		"I promise you, I scarcely know myself:\n"+
		"Hear you the news abroad?\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"Ay, that the king is dead.\n"+
		"Second Citizen\n"+
		"Bad news, by'r lady; seldom comes the better:\n"+
		"I fear, I fear 'twill prove a troublous world.\n"+
		"Enter another Citizen\n"+
		"Third Citizen\n"+
		"Neighbours, God speed!\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"Give you good morrow, sir.\n"+
		"Third Citizen\n"+
		"Doth this news hold of good King Edward's death?\n"+
		"Second Citizen\n"+
		"Ay, sir, it is too true; God help the while!\n"+
		"Third Citizen\n"+
		"Then, masters, look to see a troublous world.\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"No, no; by God's good grace his son shall reign.\n"+
		"Third Citizen\n"+
		"Woe to the land that's govern'd by a child!\n"+
		"Second Citizen\n"+
		"In him there is a hope of government,\n"+
		"That in his nonage council under him,\n"+
		"And in his full and ripen'd years himself,\n"+
		"No doubt, shall then and till then govern well.\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"So stood the state when Henry the Sixth\n"+
		"Was crown'd in Paris but at nine months old.\n"+
		"Third Citizen\n"+
		"Stood the state so? No, no, good friends, God wot;\n"+
		"For then this land was famously enrich'd\n"+
		"With politic grave counsel; then the king\n"+
		"Had virtuous uncles to protect his grace.\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"Why, so hath this, both by the father and mother.\n"+
		"Third Citizen\n"+
		"Better it were they all came by the father,\n"+
		"Or by the father there were none at all;\n"+
		"For emulation now, who shall be nearest,\n"+
		"Will touch us all too near, if God prevent not.\n"+
		"O, full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester!\n"+
		"And the queen's sons and brothers haught and proud:\n"+
		"And were they to be ruled, and not to rule,\n"+
		"This sickly land might solace as before.\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"Come, come, we fear the worst; all shall be well.\n"+
		"Third Citizen\n"+
		"When clouds appear, wise men put on their cloaks;\n"+
		"When great leaves fall, the winter is at hand;\n"+
		"When the sun sets, who doth not look for night?\n"+
		"Untimely storms make men expect a dearth.\n"+
		"All may be well; but, if God sort it so,\n"+
		"'Tis more than we deserve, or I expect.\n"+
		"Second Citizen\n"+
		"Truly, the souls of men are full of dread:\n"+
		"Ye cannot reason almost with a man\n"+
		"That looks not heavily and full of fear.\n"+
		"Third Citizen\n"+
		"Before the times of change, still is it so:\n"+
		"By a divine instinct men's minds mistrust\n"+
		"Ensuing dangers; as by proof, we see\n"+
		"The waters swell before a boisterous storm.\n"+
		"But leave it all to God. whither away?\n"+
		"Second Citizen\n"+
		"Marry, we were sent for to the justices.\n"+
		"Third Citizen\n"+
		"And so was I: I'll bear you company.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV. London. The palace.\n"+
		"Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, young YORK, QUEEN ELIZABETH, and the DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"ARCHBISHOP OF YORK\n"+
		"Last night, I hear, they lay at Northampton;\n"+
		"At Stony-Stratford will they be to-night:\n"+
		"To-morrow, or next day, they will be here.\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"I long with all my heart to see the prince:\n"+
		"I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"But I hear, no; they say my son of York\n"+
		"Hath almost overta'en him in his growth.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"Ay, mother; but I would not have it so.\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"Why, my young cousin, it is good to grow.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"Grandam, one night, as we did sit at supper,\n"+
		"My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow\n"+
		"More than my brother: 'Ay,' quoth my uncle\n"+
		"Gloucester,\n"+
		"'Small herbs have grace, great weeds do grow apace:'\n"+
		"And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast,\n"+
		"Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste.\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold\n"+
		"In him that did object the same to thee;\n"+
		"He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,\n"+
		"So long a-growing and so leisurely,\n"+
		"That, if this rule were true, he should be gracious.\n"+
		"ARCHBISHOP OF YORK\n"+
		"Why, madam, so, no doubt, he is.\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"I hope he is; but yet let mothers doubt.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"Now, by my troth, if I had been remember'd,\n"+
		"I could have given my uncle's grace a flout,\n"+
		"To touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine.\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"How, my pretty York? I pray thee, let me hear it.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast\n"+
		"That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old\n"+
		"'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.\n"+
		"Grandam, this would have been a biting jest.\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"I pray thee, pretty York, who told thee this?\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"Grandam, his nurse.\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"His nurse! why, she was dead ere thou wert born.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"If 'twere not she, I cannot tell who told me.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"A parlous boy: go to, you are too shrewd.\n"+
		"ARCHBISHOP OF YORK\n"+
		"Good madam, be not angry with the child.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"Pitchers have ears.\n"+
		"Enter a Messenger\n"+
		"ARCHBISHOP OF YORK\n"+
		"Here comes a messenger. What news?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Such news, my lord, as grieves me to unfold.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"How fares the prince?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Well, madam, and in health.\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"What is thy news then?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Lord Rivers and Lord Grey are sent to Pomfret,\n"+
		"With them Sir Thomas Vaughan, prisoners.\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"Who hath committed them?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"The mighty dukes\n"+
		"Gloucester and Buckingham.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"For what offence?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"The sum of all I can, I have disclosed;\n"+
		"Why or for what these nobles were committed\n"+
		"Is all unknown to me, my gracious lady.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"Ay me, I see the downfall of our house!\n"+
		"The tiger now hath seized the gentle hind;\n"+
		"Insulting tyranny begins to jet\n"+
		"Upon the innocent and aweless throne:\n"+
		"Welcome, destruction, death, and massacre!\n"+
		"I see, as in a map, the end of all.\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"Accursed and unquiet wrangling days,\n"+
		"How many of you have mine eyes beheld!\n"+
		"My husband lost his life to get the crown;\n"+
		"And often up and down my sons were toss'd,\n"+
		"For me to joy and weep their gain and loss:\n"+
		"And being seated, and domestic broils\n"+
		"Clean over-blown, themselves, the conquerors.\n"+
		"Make war upon themselves; blood against blood,\n"+
		"Self against self: O, preposterous\n"+
		"And frantic outrage, end thy damned spleen;\n"+
		"Or let me die, to look on death no more!\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"Come, come, my boy; we will to sanctuary.\n"+
		"Madam, farewell.\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"I'll go along with you.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"You have no cause.\n"+
		"ARCHBISHOP OF YORK\n"+
		"My gracious lady, go;\n"+
		"And thither bear your treasure and your goods.\n"+
		"For my part, I'll resign unto your grace\n"+
		"The seal I keep: and so betide to me\n"+
		"As well I tender you and all of yours!\n"+
		"Come, I'll conduct you to the sanctuary.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT III\n"+
		"SCENE I. London. A street.\n"+
		"The trumpets sound. Enter the young PRINCE EDWARD, GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM, CARDINAL, CATESBY, and others\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Welcome, sweet prince, to London, to your chamber.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign\n"+
		"The weary way hath made you melancholy.\n"+
		"PRINCE EDWARD\n"+
		"No, uncle; but our crosses on the way\n"+
		"Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy\n"+
		"I want more uncles here to welcome me.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your years\n"+
		"Hath not yet dived into the world's deceit\n"+
		"Nor more can you distinguish of a man\n"+
		"Than of his outward show; which, God he knows,\n"+
		"Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.\n"+
		"Those uncles which you want were dangerous;\n"+
		"Your grace attended to their sugar'd words,\n"+
		"But look'd not on the poison of their hearts :\n"+
		"God keep you from them, and from such false friends!\n"+
		"PRINCE EDWARD\n"+
		"God keep me from false friends! but they were none.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"My lord, the mayor of London comes to greet you.\n"+
		"Enter the Lord Mayor and his train\n"+
		"Lord Mayor\n"+
		"God bless your grace with health and happy days!\n"+
		"PRINCE EDWARD\n"+
		"I thank you, good my lord; and thank you all.\n"+
		"I thought my mother, and my brother York,\n"+
		"Would long ere this have met us on the way\n"+
		"Fie, what a slug is Hastings, that he comes not\n"+
		"To tell us whether they will come or no!\n"+
		"Enter HASTINGS\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"And, in good time, here comes the sweating lord.\n"+
		"PRINCE EDWARD\n"+
		"Welcome, my lord: what, will our mother come?\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"On what occasion, God he knows, not I,\n"+
		"The queen your mother, and your brother York,\n"+
		"Have taken sanctuary: the tender prince\n"+
		"Would fain have come with me to meet your grace,\n"+
		"But by his mother was perforce withheld.\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Fie, what an indirect and peevish course\n"+
		"Is this of hers! Lord cardinal, will your grace\n"+
		"Persuade the queen to send the Duke of York\n"+
		"Unto his princely brother presently?\n"+
		"If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,\n"+
		"And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.\n"+
		"CARDINAL\n"+
		"My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory\n"+
		"Can from his mother win the Duke of York,\n"+
		"Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate\n"+
		"To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid\n"+
		"We should infringe the holy privilege\n"+
		"Of blessed sanctuary! not for all this land\n"+
		"Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"You are too senseless--obstinate, my lord,\n"+
		"Too ceremonious and traditional\n"+
		"Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,\n"+
		"You break not sanctuary in seizing him.\n"+
		"The benefit thereof is always granted\n"+
		"To those whose dealings have deserved the place,\n"+
		"And those who have the wit to claim the place:\n"+
		"This prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserved it;\n"+
		"And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it:\n"+
		"Then, taking him from thence that is not there,\n"+
		"You break no privilege nor charter there.\n"+
		"Oft have I heard of sanctuary men;\n"+
		"But sanctuary children ne'er till now.\n"+
		"CARDINAL\n"+
		"My lord, you shall o'er-rule my mind for once.\n"+
		"Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"I go, my lord.\n"+
		"PRINCE EDWARD\n"+
		"Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.\n"+
		"Exeunt CARDINAL and HASTINGS\n"+
		"Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,\n"+
		"Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Where it seems best unto your royal self.\n"+
		"If I may counsel you, some day or two\n"+
		"Your highness shall repose you at the Tower:\n"+
		"Then where you please, and shall be thought most fit\n"+
		"For your best health and recreation.\n"+
		"PRINCE EDWARD\n"+
		"I do not like the Tower, of any place.\n"+
		"Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"He did, my gracious lord, begin that place;\n"+
		"Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.\n"+
		"PRINCE EDWARD\n"+
		"Is it upon record, or else reported\n"+
		"Successively from age to age, he built it?\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Upon record, my gracious lord.\n"+
		"PRINCE EDWARD\n"+
		"But say, my lord, it were not register'd,\n"+
		"Methinks the truth should live from age to age,\n"+
		"As 'twere retail'd to all posterity,\n"+
		"Even to the general all-ending day.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"[Aside] So wise so young, they say, do never\n"+
		"live long.\n"+
		"PRINCE EDWARD\n"+
		"What say you, uncle?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"I say, without characters, fame lives long.\n"+
		"Aside\n"+
		"Thus, like the formal vice, Iniquity,\n"+
		"I moralize two meanings in one word.\n"+
		"PRINCE EDWARD\n"+
		"That Julius Caesar was a famous man;\n"+
		"With what his valour did enrich his wit,\n"+
		"His wit set down to make his valour live\n"+
		"Death makes no conquest of this conqueror;\n"+
		"For now he lives in fame, though not in life.\n"+
		"I'll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham,--\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"What, my gracious lord?\n"+
		"PRINCE EDWARD\n"+
		"An if I live until I be a man,\n"+
		"I'll win our ancient right in France again,\n"+
		"Or die a soldier, as I lived a king.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"[Aside] Short summers lightly have a forward spring.\n"+
		"Enter young YORK, HASTINGS, and the CARDINAL\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of York.\n"+
		"PRINCE EDWARD\n"+
		"Richard of York! how fares our loving brother?\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"Well, my dread lord; so must I call you now.\n"+
		"PRINCE EDWARD\n"+
		"Ay, brother, to our grief, as it is yours:\n"+
		"Too late he died that might have kept that title,\n"+
		"Which by his death hath lost much majesty.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,\n"+
		"You said that idle weeds are fast in growth\n"+
		"The prince my brother hath outgrown me far.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"He hath, my lord.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"And therefore is he idle?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"Then is he more beholding to you than I.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"He may command me as my sovereign;\n"+
		"But you have power in me as in a kinsman.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"My dagger, little cousin? with all my heart.\n"+
		"PRINCE EDWARD\n"+
		"A beggar, brother?\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;\n"+
		"And being but a toy, which is no grief to give.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"A greater gift! O, that's the sword to it.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"A gentle cousin, were it light enough.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"O, then, I see, you will part but with light gifts;\n"+
		"In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"It is too heavy for your grace to wear.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"What, would you have my weapon, little lord?\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"I would, that I might thank you as you call me.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"How?\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"Little.\n"+
		"PRINCE EDWARD\n"+
		"My Lord of York will still be cross in talk:\n"+
		"Uncle, your grace knows how to bear with him.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me:\n"+
		"Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me;\n"+
		"Because that I am little, like an ape,\n"+
		"He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!\n"+
		"To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle,\n"+
		"He prettily and aptly taunts himself:\n"+
		"So cunning and so young is wonderful.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"My lord, will't please you pass along?\n"+
		"Myself and my good cousin Buckingham\n"+
		"Will to your mother, to entreat of her\n"+
		"To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?\n"+
		"PRINCE EDWARD\n"+
		"My lord protector needs will have it so.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Why, what should you fear?\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost:\n"+
		"My grandam told me he was murdered there.\n"+
		"PRINCE EDWARD\n"+
		"I fear no uncles dead.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Nor none that live, I hope.\n"+
		"PRINCE EDWARD\n"+
		"An if they live, I hope I need not fear.\n"+
		"But come, my lord; and with a heavy heart,\n"+
		"Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower.\n"+
		"A Sennet. Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM and CATESBY\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Think you, my lord, this little prating York\n"+
		"Was not incensed by his subtle mother\n"+
		"To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"No doubt, no doubt; O, 'tis a parlous boy;\n"+
		"Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable\n"+
		"He is all the mother's, from the top to toe.\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby.\n"+
		"Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend\n"+
		"As closely to conceal what we impart:\n"+
		"Thou know'st our reasons urged upon the way;\n"+
		"What think'st thou? is it not an easy matter\n"+
		"To make William Lord Hastings of our mind,\n"+
		"For the instalment of this noble duke\n"+
		"In the seat royal of this famous isle?\n"+
		"CATESBY\n"+
		"He for his father's sake so loves the prince,\n"+
		"That he will not be won to aught against him.\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"What think'st thou, then, of Stanley? what will he?\n"+
		"CATESBY\n"+
		"He will do all in all as Hastings doth.\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Well, then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby,\n"+
		"And, as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings,\n"+
		"How doth he stand affected to our purpose;\n"+
		"And summon him to-morrow to the Tower,\n"+
		"To sit about the coronation.\n"+
		"If thou dost find him tractable to us,\n"+
		"Encourage him, and show him all our reasons:\n"+
		"If he be leaden, icy-cold, unwilling,\n"+
		"Be thou so too; and so break off your talk,\n"+
		"And give us notice of his inclination:\n"+
		"For we to-morrow hold divided councils,\n"+
		"Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Commend me to Lord William: tell him, Catesby,\n"+
		"His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries\n"+
		"To-morrow are let blood at Pomfret-castle;\n"+
		"And bid my friend, for joy of this good news,\n"+
		"Give mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more.\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Good Catesby, go, effect this business soundly.\n"+
		"CATESBY\n"+
		"My good lords both, with all the heed I may.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?\n"+
		"CATESBY\n"+
		"You shall, my lord.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"At Crosby Place, there shall you find us both.\n"+
		"Exit CATESBY\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Now, my lord, what shall we do, if we perceive\n"+
		"Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Chop off his head, man; somewhat we will do:\n"+
		"And, look, when I am king, claim thou of me\n"+
		"The earldom of Hereford, and the moveables\n"+
		"Whereof the king my brother stood possess'd.\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"I'll claim that promise at your grace's hands.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"And look to have it yielded with all willingness.\n"+
		"Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards\n"+
		"We may digest our complots in some form.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. Before Lord Hastings' house.\n"+
		"Enter a Messenger\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"What, ho! my lord!\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"[Within] Who knocks at the door?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"A messenger from the Lord Stanley.\n"+
		"Enter HASTINGS\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"What is't o'clock?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Upon the stroke of four.\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"Cannot thy master sleep these tedious nights?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"So it should seem by that I have to say.\n"+
		"First, he commends him to your noble lordship.\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"And then?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"And then he sends you word\n"+
		"He dreamt to-night the boar had razed his helm:\n"+
		"Besides, he says there are two councils held;\n"+
		"And that may be determined at the one\n"+
		"which may make you and him to rue at the other.\n"+
		"Therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure,\n"+
		"If presently you will take horse with him,\n"+
		"And with all speed post with him toward the north,\n"+
		"To shun the danger that his soul divines.\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"Go, fellow, go, return unto thy lord;\n"+
		"Bid him not fear the separated councils\n"+
		"His honour and myself are at the one,\n"+
		"And at the other is my servant Catesby\n"+
		"Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us\n"+
		"Whereof I shall not have intelligence.\n"+
		"Tell him his fears are shallow, wanting instance:\n"+
		"And for his dreams, I wonder he is so fond\n"+
		"To trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers\n"+
		"To fly the boar before the boar pursues,\n"+
		"Were to incense the boar to follow us\n"+
		"And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.\n"+
		"Go, bid thy master rise and come to me\n"+
		"And we will both together to the Tower,\n"+
		"Where, he shall see, the boar will use us kindly.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"My gracious lord, I'll tell him what you say.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"Enter CATESBY\n"+
		"CATESBY\n"+
		"Many good morrows to my noble lord!\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"Good morrow, Catesby; you are early stirring\n"+
		"What news, what news, in this our tottering state?\n"+
		"CATESBY\n"+
		"It is a reeling world, indeed, my lord;\n"+
		"And I believe twill never stand upright\n"+
		"Till Richard wear the garland of the realm.\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"How! wear the garland! dost thou mean the crown?\n"+
		"CATESBY\n"+
		"Ay, my good lord.\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"I'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders\n"+
		"Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.\n"+
		"But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?\n"+
		"CATESBY\n"+
		"Ay, on my life; and hopes to find forward\n"+
		"Upon his party for the gain thereof:\n"+
		"And thereupon he sends you this good news,\n"+
		"That this same very day your enemies,\n"+
		"The kindred of the queen, must die at Pomfret.\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"Indeed, I am no mourner for that news,\n"+
		"Because they have been still mine enemies:\n"+
		"But, that I'll give my voice on Richard's side,\n"+
		"To bar my master's heirs in true descent,\n"+
		"God knows I will not do it, to the death.\n"+
		"CATESBY\n"+
		"God keep your lordship in that gracious mind!\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"But I shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence,\n"+
		"That they who brought me in my master's hate\n"+
		"I live to look upon their tragedy.\n"+
		"I tell thee, Catesby--\n"+
		"CATESBY\n"+
		"What, my lord?\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"Ere a fortnight make me elder,\n"+
		"I'll send some packing that yet think not on it.\n"+
		"CATESBY\n"+
		"'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,\n"+
		"When men are unprepared and look not for it.\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"O monstrous, monstrous! and so falls it out\n"+
		"With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey: and so 'twill do\n"+
		"With some men else, who think themselves as safe\n"+
		"As thou and I; who, as thou know'st, are dear\n"+
		"To princely Richard and to Buckingham.\n"+
		"CATESBY\n"+
		"The princes both make high account of you;\n"+
		"Aside\n"+
		"For they account his head upon the bridge.\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"I know they do; and I have well deserved it.\n"+
		"Enter STANLEY\n"+
		"Come on, come on; where is your boar-spear, man?\n"+
		"Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided?\n"+
		"STANLEY\n"+
		"My lord, good morrow; good morrow, Catesby:\n"+
		"You may jest on, but, by the holy rood,\n"+
		"I do not like these several councils, I.\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"My lord,\n"+
		"I hold my life as dear as you do yours;\n"+
		"And never in my life, I do protest,\n"+
		"Was it more precious to me than 'tis now:\n"+
		"Think you, but that I know our state secure,\n"+
		"I would be so triumphant as I am?\n"+
		"STANLEY\n"+
		"The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from London,\n"+
		"Were jocund, and supposed their state was sure,\n"+
		"And they indeed had no cause to mistrust;\n"+
		"But yet, you see how soon the day o'ercast.\n"+
		"This sudden stag of rancour I misdoubt:\n"+
		"Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward!\n"+
		"What, shall we toward the Tower? the day is spent.\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"Come, come, have with you. Wot you what, my lord?\n"+
		"To-day the lords you talk of are beheaded.\n"+
		"LORD STANLEY\n"+
		"They, for their truth, might better wear their heads\n"+
		"Than some that have accused them wear their hats.\n"+
		"But come, my lord, let us away.\n"+
		"Enter a Pursuivant\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"Go on before; I'll talk with this good fellow.\n"+
		"Exeunt STANLEY and CATESBY\n"+
		"How now, sirrah! how goes the world with thee?\n"+
		"Pursuivant\n"+
		"The better that your lordship please to ask.\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"I tell thee, man, 'tis better with me now\n"+
		"Than when I met thee last where now we meet:\n"+
		"Then was I going prisoner to the Tower,\n"+
		"By the suggestion of the queen's allies;\n"+
		"But now, I tell thee--keep it to thyself--\n"+
		"This day those enemies are put to death,\n"+
		"And I in better state than e'er I was.\n"+
		"Pursuivant\n"+
		"God hold it, to your honour's good content!\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"Gramercy, fellow: there, drink that for me.\n"+
		"Throws him his purse\n"+
		"Pursuivant\n"+
		"God save your lordship!\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"Enter a Priest\n"+
		"Priest\n"+
		"Well met, my lord; I am glad to see your honour.\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"I thank thee, good Sir John, with all my heart.\n"+
		"I am in your debt for your last exercise;\n"+
		"Come the next Sabbath, and I will content you.\n"+
		"He whispers in his ear\n"+
		"Enter BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"What, talking with a priest, lord chamberlain?\n"+
		"Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest;\n"+
		"Your honour hath no shriving work in hand.\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"Good faith, and when I met this holy man,\n"+
		"Those men you talk of came into my mind.\n"+
		"What, go you toward the Tower?\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"I do, my lord; but long I shall not stay\n"+
		"I shall return before your lordship thence.\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"'Tis like enough, for I stay dinner there.\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"[Aside] And supper too, although thou know'st it not.\n"+
		"Come, will you go?\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"I'll wait upon your lordship.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. Pomfret Castle.\n"+
		"Enter RATCLIFF, with halberds, carrying RIVERS, GREY, and VAUGHAN to death\n"+
		"RATCLIFF\n"+
		"Come, bring forth the prisoners.\n"+
		"RIVERS\n"+
		"Sir Richard Ratcliff, let me tell thee this:\n"+
		"To-day shalt thou behold a subject die\n"+
		"For truth, for duty, and for loyalty.\n"+
		"GREY\n"+
		"God keep the prince from all the pack of you!\n"+
		"A knot you are of damned blood-suckers!\n"+
		"VAUGHAN\n"+
		"You live that shall cry woe for this after.\n"+
		"RATCLIFF\n"+
		"Dispatch; the limit of your lives is out.\n"+
		"RIVERS\n"+
		"O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou bloody prison,\n"+
		"Fatal and ominous to noble peers!\n"+
		"Within the guilty closure of thy walls\n"+
		"Richard the second here was hack'd to death;\n"+
		"And, for more slander to thy dismal seat,\n"+
		"We give thee up our guiltless blood to drink.\n"+
		"GREY\n"+
		"Now Margaret's curse is fall'n upon our heads,\n"+
		"For standing by when Richard stabb'd her son.\n"+
		"RIVERS\n"+
		"Then cursed she Hastings, then cursed she Buckingham,\n"+
		"Then cursed she Richard. O, remember, God\n"+
		"To hear her prayers for them, as now for us\n"+
		"And for my sister and her princely sons,\n"+
		"Be satisfied, dear God, with our true blood,\n"+
		"Which, as thou know'st, unjustly must be spilt.\n"+
		"RATCLIFF\n"+
		"Make haste; the hour of death is expiate.\n"+
		"RIVERS\n"+
		"Come, Grey, come, Vaughan, let us all embrace:\n"+
		"And take our leave, until we meet in heaven.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV. The Tower of London.\n"+
		"Enter BUCKINGHAM, DERBY, HASTINGS, the BISHOP OF ELY, RATCLIFF, LOVEL, with others, and take their seats at a table\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"My lords, at once: the cause why we are met\n"+
		"Is, to determine of the coronation.\n"+
		"In God's name, speak: when is the royal day?\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Are all things fitting for that royal time?\n"+
		"DERBY\n"+
		"It is, and wants but nomination.\n"+
		"BISHOP OF ELY\n"+
		"To-morrow, then, I judge a happy day.\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Who knows the lord protector's mind herein?\n"+
		"Who is most inward with the royal duke?\n"+
		"BISHOP OF ELY\n"+
		"Your grace, we think, should soonest know his mind.\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Who, I, my lord I we know each other's faces,\n"+
		"But for our hearts, he knows no more of mine,\n"+
		"Than I of yours;\n"+
		"Nor I no more of his, than you of mine.\n"+
		"Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love.\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"I thank his grace, I know he loves me well;\n"+
		"But, for his purpose in the coronation.\n"+
		"I have not sounded him, nor he deliver'd\n"+
		"His gracious pleasure any way therein:\n"+
		"But you, my noble lords, may name the time;\n"+
		"And in the duke's behalf I'll give my voice,\n"+
		"Which, I presume, he'll take in gentle part.\n"+
		"Enter GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"BISHOP OF ELY\n"+
		"Now in good time, here comes the duke himself.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"My noble lords and cousins all, good morrow.\n"+
		"I have been long a sleeper; but, I hope,\n"+
		"My absence doth neglect no great designs,\n"+
		"Which by my presence might have been concluded.\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Had not you come upon your cue, my lord\n"+
		"William Lord Hastings had pronounced your part,--\n"+
		"I mean, your voice,--for crowning of the king.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder;\n"+
		"His lordship knows me well, and loves me well.\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"I thank your grace.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"My lord of Ely!\n"+
		"BISHOP OF ELY\n"+
		"My lord?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"When I was last in Holborn,\n"+
		"I saw good strawberries in your garden there\n"+
		"I do beseech you send for some of them.\n"+
		"BISHOP OF ELY\n"+
		"Marry, and will, my lord, with all my heart.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.\n"+
		"Drawing him aside\n"+
		"Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business,\n"+
		"And finds the testy gentleman so hot,\n"+
		"As he will lose his head ere give consent\n"+
		"His master's son, as worshipful as he terms it,\n"+
		"Shall lose the royalty of England's throne.\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Withdraw you hence, my lord, I'll follow you.\n"+
		"Exit GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM following\n"+
		"DERBY\n"+
		"We have not yet set down this day of triumph.\n"+
		"To-morrow, in mine opinion, is too sudden;\n"+
		"For I myself am not so well provided\n"+
		"As else I would be, were the day prolong'd.\n"+
		"Re-enter BISHOP OF ELY\n"+
		"BISHOP OF ELY\n"+
		"Where is my lord protector? I have sent for these\n"+
		"strawberries.\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"His grace looks cheerfully and smooth to-day;\n"+
		"There's some conceit or other likes him well,\n"+
		"When he doth bid good morrow with such a spirit.\n"+
		"I think there's never a man in Christendom\n"+
		"That can less hide his love or hate than he;\n"+
		"For by his face straight shall you know his heart.\n"+
		"DERBY\n"+
		"What of his heart perceive you in his face\n"+
		"By any likelihood he show'd to-day?\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"Marry, that with no man here he is offended;\n"+
		"For, were he, he had shown it in his looks.\n"+
		"DERBY\n"+
		"I pray God he be not, I say.\n"+
		"Re-enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"I pray you all, tell me what they deserve\n"+
		"That do conspire my death with devilish plots\n"+
		"Of damned witchcraft, and that have prevail'd\n"+
		"Upon my body with their hellish charms?\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"The tender love I bear your grace, my lord,\n"+
		"Makes me most forward in this noble presence\n"+
		"To doom the offenders, whatsoever they be\n"+
		"I say, my lord, they have deserved death.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Then be your eyes the witness of this ill:\n"+
		"See how I am bewitch'd; behold mine arm\n"+
		"Is, like a blasted sapling, wither'd up:\n"+
		"And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch,\n"+
		"Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore,\n"+
		"That by their witchcraft thus have marked me.\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"If they have done this thing, my gracious lord--\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"If I thou protector of this damned strumpet--\n"+
		"Tellest thou me of 'ifs'? Thou art a traitor:\n"+
		"Off with his head! Now, by Saint Paul I swear,\n"+
		"I will not dine until I see the same.\n"+
		"Lovel and Ratcliff, look that it be done:\n"+
		"The rest, that love me, rise and follow me.\n"+
		"Exeunt all but HASTINGS, RATCLIFF, and LOVEL\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"Woe, woe for England! not a whit for me;\n"+
		"For I, too fond, might have prevented this.\n"+
		"Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm;\n"+
		"But I disdain'd it, and did scorn to fly:\n"+
		"Three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble,\n"+
		"And startled, when he look'd upon the Tower,\n"+
		"As loath to bear me to the slaughter-house.\n"+
		"O, now I want the priest that spake to me:\n"+
		"I now repent I told the pursuivant\n"+
		"As 'twere triumphing at mine enemies,\n"+
		"How they at Pomfret bloodily were butcher'd,\n"+
		"And I myself secure in grace and favour.\n"+
		"O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse\n"+
		"Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head!\n"+
		"RATCLIFF\n"+
		"Dispatch, my lord; the duke would be at dinner:\n"+
		"Make a short shrift; he longs to see your head.\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"O momentary grace of mortal men,\n"+
		"Which we more hunt for than the grace of God!\n"+
		"Who builds his hopes in air of your good looks,\n"+
		"Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,\n"+
		"Ready, with every nod, to tumble down\n"+
		"Into the fatal bowels of the deep.\n"+
		"LOVEL\n"+
		"Come, come, dispatch; 'tis bootless to exclaim.\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"O bloody Richard! miserable England!\n"+
		"I prophesy the fearful'st time to thee\n"+
		"That ever wretched age hath look'd upon.\n"+
		"Come, lead me to the block; bear him my head.\n"+
		"They smile at me that shortly shall be dead.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE V. The Tower-walls.\n"+
		"Enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM, in rotten armour, marvellous ill-favoured\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Come, cousin, canst thou quake, and change thy colour,\n"+
		"Murder thy breath in the middle of a word,\n"+
		"And then begin again, and stop again,\n"+
		"As if thou wert distraught and mad with terror?\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian;\n"+
		"Speak and look back, and pry on every side,\n"+
		"Tremble and start at wagging of a straw,\n"+
		"Intending deep suspicion: ghastly looks\n"+
		"Are at my service, like enforced smiles;\n"+
		"And both are ready in their offices,\n"+
		"At any time, to grace my stratagems.\n"+
		"But what, is Catesby gone?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"He is; and, see, he brings the mayor along.\n"+
		"Enter the Lord Mayor and CATESBY\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Lord mayor,--\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Look to the drawbridge there!\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Hark! a drum.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Catesby, o'erlook the walls.\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Lord mayor, the reason we have sent--\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Look back, defend thee, here are enemies.\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"God and our innocency defend and guard us!\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Be patient, they are friends, Ratcliff and Lovel.\n"+
		"Enter LOVEL and RATCLIFF, with HASTINGS' head\n"+
		"LOVEL\n"+
		"Here is the head of that ignoble traitor,\n"+
		"The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"So dear I loved the man, that I must weep.\n"+
		"I took him for the plainest harmless creature\n"+
		"That breathed upon this earth a Christian;\n"+
		"Made him my book wherein my soul recorded\n"+
		"The history of all her secret thoughts:\n"+
		"So smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue,\n"+
		"That, his apparent open guilt omitted,\n"+
		"I mean, his conversation with Shore's wife,\n"+
		"He lived from all attainder of suspect.\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Well, well, he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor\n"+
		"That ever lived.\n"+
		"Would you imagine, or almost believe,\n"+
		"Were't not that, by great preservation,\n"+
		"We live to tell it you, the subtle traitor\n"+
		"This day had plotted, in the council-house\n"+
		"To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester?\n"+
		"Lord Mayor\n"+
		"What, had he so?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"What, think You we are Turks or infidels?\n"+
		"Or that we would, against the form of law,\n"+
		"Proceed thus rashly to the villain's death,\n"+
		"But that the extreme peril of the case,\n"+
		"The peace of England and our persons' safety,\n"+
		"Enforced us to this execution?\n"+
		"Lord Mayor\n"+
		"Now, fair befall you! he deserved his death;\n"+
		"And you my good lords, both have well proceeded,\n"+
		"To warn false traitors from the like attempts.\n"+
		"I never look'd for better at his hands,\n"+
		"After he once fell in with Mistress Shore.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Yet had not we determined he should die,\n"+
		"Until your lordship came to see his death;\n"+
		"Which now the loving haste of these our friends,\n"+
		"Somewhat against our meaning, have prevented:\n"+
		"Because, my lord, we would have had you heard\n"+
		"The traitor speak, and timorously confess\n"+
		"The manner and the purpose of his treason;\n"+
		"That you might well have signified the same\n"+
		"Unto the citizens, who haply may\n"+
		"Misconstrue us in him and wail his death.\n"+
		"Lord Mayor\n"+
		"But, my good lord, your grace's word shall serve,\n"+
		"As well as I had seen and heard him speak\n"+
		"And doubt you not, right noble princes both,\n"+
		"But I'll acquaint our duteous citizens\n"+
		"With all your just proceedings in this cause.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"And to that end we wish'd your lord-ship here,\n"+
		"To avoid the carping censures of the world.\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"But since you come too late of our intents,\n"+
		"Yet witness what you hear we did intend:\n"+
		"And so, my good lord mayor, we bid farewell.\n"+
		"Exit Lord Mayor\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham.\n"+
		"The mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post:\n"+
		"There, at your meet'st advantage of the time,\n"+
		"Infer the bastardy of Edward's children:\n"+
		"Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen,\n"+
		"Only for saying he would make his son\n"+
		"Heir to the crown; meaning indeed his house,\n"+
		"Which, by the sign thereof was termed so.\n"+
		"Moreover, urge his hateful luxury\n"+
		"And bestial appetite in change of lust;\n"+
		"Which stretched to their servants, daughters, wives,\n"+
		"Even where his lustful eye or savage heart,\n"+
		"Without control, listed to make his prey.\n"+
		"Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:\n"+
		"Tell them, when that my mother went with child\n"+
		"Of that unsatiate Edward, noble York\n"+
		"My princely father then had wars in France\n"+
		"And, by just computation of the time,\n"+
		"Found that the issue was not his begot;\n"+
		"Which well appeared in his lineaments,\n"+
		"Being nothing like the noble duke my father:\n"+
		"But touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off,\n"+
		"Because you know, my lord, my mother lives.\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Fear not, my lord, I'll play the orator\n"+
		"As if the golden fee for which I plead\n"+
		"Were for myself: and so, my lord, adieu.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard's Castle;\n"+
		"Where you shall find me well accompanied\n"+
		"With reverend fathers and well-learned bishops.\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"I go: and towards three or four o'clock\n"+
		"Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.\n"+
		"Exit BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Go, Lovel, with all speed to Doctor Shaw;\n"+
		"To CATESBY\n"+
		"Go thou to Friar Penker; bid them both\n"+
		"Meet me within this hour at Baynard's Castle.\n"+
		"Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Now will I in, to take some privy order,\n"+
		"To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight;\n"+
		"And to give notice, that no manner of person\n"+
		"At any time have recourse unto the princes.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE VI. The same.\n"+
		"Enter a Scrivener, with a paper in his hand\n"+
		"Scrivener\n"+
		"This is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings;\n"+
		"Which in a set hand fairly is engross'd,\n"+
		"That it may be this day read over in Paul's.\n"+
		"And mark how well the sequel hangs together:\n"+
		"Eleven hours I spent to write it over,\n"+
		"For yesternight by Catesby was it brought me;\n"+
		"The precedent was full as long a-doing:\n"+
		"And yet within these five hours lived Lord Hastings,\n"+
		"Untainted, unexamined, free, at liberty\n"+
		"Here's a good world the while! Why who's so gross,\n"+
		"That seeth not this palpable device?\n"+
		"Yet who's so blind, but says he sees it not?\n"+
		"Bad is the world; and all will come to nought,\n"+
		"When such bad dealings must be seen in thought.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE VII. Baynard's Castle.\n"+
		"Enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM, at several doors\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"How now, my lord, what say the citizens?\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Now, by the holy mother of our Lord,\n"+
		"The citizens are mum and speak not a word.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's children?\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy,\n"+
		"And his contract by deputy in France;\n"+
		"The insatiate greediness of his desires,\n"+
		"And his enforcement of the city wives;\n"+
		"His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,\n"+
		"As being got, your father then in France,\n"+
		"His resemblance, being not like the duke;\n"+
		"Withal I did infer your lineaments,\n"+
		"Being the right idea of your father,\n"+
		"Both in your form and nobleness of mind;\n"+
		"Laid open all your victories in Scotland,\n"+
		"Your dicipline in war, wisdom in peace,\n"+
		"Your bounty, virtue, fair humility:\n"+
		"Indeed, left nothing fitting for the purpose\n"+
		"Untouch'd, or slightly handled, in discourse\n"+
		"And when mine oratory grew to an end\n"+
		"I bid them that did love their country's good\n"+
		"Cry 'God save Richard, England's royal king!'\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Ah! and did they so?\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"No, so God help me, they spake not a word;\n"+
		"But, like dumb statues or breathing stones,\n"+
		"Gazed each on other, and look'd deadly pale.\n"+
		"Which when I saw, I reprehended them;\n"+
		"And ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence:\n"+
		"His answer was, the people were not wont\n"+
		"To be spoke to but by the recorder.\n"+
		"Then he was urged to tell my tale again,\n"+
		"'Thus saith the duke, thus hath the duke inferr'd;'\n"+
		"But nothing spake in warrant from himself.\n"+
		"When he had done, some followers of mine own,\n"+
		"At the lower end of the hall, hurl'd up their caps,\n"+
		"And some ten voices cried 'God save King Richard!'\n"+
		"And thus I took the vantage of those few,\n"+
		"'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I;\n"+
		"'This general applause and loving shout\n"+
		"Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard:'\n"+
		"And even here brake off, and came away.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"What tongueless blocks were they! would not they speak?\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"No, by my troth, my lord.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Will not the mayor then and his brethren come?\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"The mayor is here at hand: intend some fear;\n"+
		"Be not you spoke with, but by mighty suit:\n"+
		"And look you get a prayer-book in your hand,\n"+
		"And stand betwixt two churchmen, good my lord;\n"+
		"For on that ground I'll build a holy descant:\n"+
		"And be not easily won to our request:\n"+
		"Play the maid's part, still answer nay, and take it.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"I go; and if you plead as well for them\n"+
		"As I can say nay to thee for myself,\n"+
		"No doubt well bring it to a happy issue.\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Go, go, up to the leads; the lord mayor knocks.\n"+
		"Exit GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Enter the Lord Mayor and Citizens\n"+
		"Welcome my lord; I dance attendance here;\n"+
		"I think the duke will not be spoke withal.\n"+
		"Enter CATESBY\n"+
		"Here comes his servant: how now, Catesby,\n"+
		"What says he?\n"+
		"CATESBY\n"+
		"My lord: he doth entreat your grace;\n"+
		"To visit him to-morrow or next day:\n"+
		"He is within, with two right reverend fathers,\n"+
		"Divinely bent to meditation;\n"+
		"And no worldly suit would he be moved,\n"+
		"To draw him from his holy exercise.\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Return, good Catesby, to thy lord again;\n"+
		"Tell him, myself, the mayor and citizens,\n"+
		"In deep designs and matters of great moment,\n"+
		"No less importing than our general good,\n"+
		"Are come to have some conference with his grace.\n"+
		"CATESBY\n"+
		"I'll tell him what you say, my lord.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Ah, ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!\n"+
		"He is not lolling on a lewd day-bed,\n"+
		"But on his knees at meditation;\n"+
		"Not dallying with a brace of courtezans,\n"+
		"But meditating with two deep divines;\n"+
		"Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,\n"+
		"But praying, to enrich his watchful soul:\n"+
		"Happy were England, would this gracious prince\n"+
		"Take on himself the sovereignty thereof:\n"+
		"But, sure, I fear, we shall ne'er win him to it.\n"+
		"Lord Mayor\n"+
		"Marry, God forbid his grace should say us nay!\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"I fear he will.\n"+
		"Re-enter CATESBY\n"+
		"How now, Catesby, what says your lord?\n"+
		"CATESBY\n"+
		"My lord,\n"+
		"He wonders to what end you have assembled\n"+
		"Such troops of citizens to speak with him,\n"+
		"His grace not being warn'd thereof before:\n"+
		"My lord, he fears you mean no good to him.\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Sorry I am my noble cousin should\n"+
		"Suspect me, that I mean no good to him:\n"+
		"By heaven, I come in perfect love to him;\n"+
		"And so once more return and tell his grace.\n"+
		"Exit CATESBY\n"+
		"When holy and devout religious men\n"+
		"Are at their beads, 'tis hard to draw them thence,\n"+
		"So sweet is zealous contemplation.\n"+
		"Enter GLOUCESTER aloft, between two Bishops. CATESBY returns\n"+
		"Lord Mayor\n"+
		"See, where he stands between two clergymen!\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Two props of virtue for a Christian prince,\n"+
		"To stay him from the fall of vanity:\n"+
		"And, see, a book of prayer in his hand,\n"+
		"True ornaments to know a holy man.\n"+
		"Famous Plantagenet, most gracious prince,\n"+
		"Lend favourable ears to our request;\n"+
		"And pardon us the interruption\n"+
		"Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"My lord, there needs no such apology:\n"+
		"I rather do beseech you pardon me,\n"+
		"Who, earnest in the service of my God,\n"+
		"Neglect the visitation of my friends.\n"+
		"But, leaving this, what is your grace's pleasure?\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above,\n"+
		"And all good men of this ungovern'd isle.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"I do suspect I have done some offence\n"+
		"That seems disgracious in the city's eyes,\n"+
		"And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"You have, my lord: would it might please your grace,\n"+
		"At our entreaties, to amend that fault!\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Then know, it is your fault that you resign\n"+
		"The supreme seat, the throne majestical,\n"+
		"The scepter'd office of your ancestors,\n"+
		"Your state of fortune and your due of birth,\n"+
		"The lineal glory of your royal house,\n"+
		"To the corruption of a blemished stock:\n"+
		"Whilst, in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,\n"+
		"Which here we waken to our country's good,\n"+
		"This noble isle doth want her proper limbs;\n"+
		"Her face defaced with scars of infamy,\n"+
		"Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,\n"+
		"And almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf\n"+
		"Of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion.\n"+
		"Which to recure, we heartily solicit\n"+
		"Your gracious self to take on you the charge\n"+
		"And kingly government of this your land,\n"+
		"Not as protector, steward, substitute,\n"+
		"Or lowly factor for another's gain;\n"+
		"But as successively from blood to blood,\n"+
		"Your right of birth, your empery, your own.\n"+
		"For this, consorted with the citizens,\n"+
		"Your very worshipful and loving friends,\n"+
		"And by their vehement instigation,\n"+
		"In this just suit come I to move your grace.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"I know not whether to depart in silence,\n"+
		"Or bitterly to speak in your reproof.\n"+
		"Best fitteth my degree or your condition\n"+
		"If not to answer, you might haply think\n"+
		"Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded\n"+
		"To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,\n"+
		"Which fondly you would here impose on me;\n"+
		"If to reprove you for this suit of yours,\n"+
		"So season'd with your faithful love to me.\n"+
		"Then, on the other side, I cheque'd my friends.\n"+
		"Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,\n"+
		"And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,\n"+
		"Definitively thus I answer you.\n"+
		"Your love deserves my thanks; but my desert\n"+
		"Unmeritable shuns your high request.\n"+
		"First if all obstacles were cut away,\n"+
		"And that my path were even to the crown,\n"+
		"As my ripe revenue and due by birth\n"+
		"Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,\n"+
		"So mighty and so many my defects,\n"+
		"As I had rather hide me from my greatness,\n"+
		"Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,\n"+
		"Than in my greatness covet to be hid,\n"+
		"And in the vapour of my glory smother'd.\n"+
		"But, God be thank'd, there's no need of me,\n"+
		"And much I need to help you, if need were;\n"+
		"The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,\n"+
		"Which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time,\n"+
		"Will well become the seat of majesty,\n"+
		"And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.\n"+
		"On him I lay what you would lay on me,\n"+
		"The right and fortune of his happy stars;\n"+
		"Which God defend that I should wring from him!\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"My lord, this argues conscience in your grace;\n"+
		"But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,\n"+
		"All circumstances well considered.\n"+
		"You say that Edward is your brother's son:\n"+
		"So say we too, but not by Edward's wife;\n"+
		"For first he was contract to Lady Lucy--\n"+
		"Your mother lives a witness to that vow--\n"+
		"And afterward by substitute betroth'd\n"+
		"To Bona, sister to the King of France.\n"+
		"These both put by a poor petitioner,\n"+
		"A care-crazed mother of a many children,\n"+
		"A beauty-waning and distressed widow,\n"+
		"Even in the afternoon of her best days,\n"+
		"Made prize and purchase of his lustful eye,\n"+
		"Seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts\n"+
		"To base declension and loathed bigamy\n"+
		"By her, in his unlawful bed, he got\n"+
		"This Edward, whom our manners term the prince.\n"+
		"More bitterly could I expostulate,\n"+
		"Save that, for reverence to some alive,\n"+
		"I give a sparing limit to my tongue.\n"+
		"Then, good my lord, take to your royal self\n"+
		"This proffer'd benefit of dignity;\n"+
		"If non to bless us and the land withal,\n"+
		"Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry\n"+
		"From the corruption of abusing times,\n"+
		"Unto a lineal true-derived course.\n"+
		"Lord Mayor\n"+
		"Do, good my lord, your citizens entreat you.\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love.\n"+
		"CATESBY\n"+
		"O, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit!\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Alas, why would you heap these cares on me?\n"+
		"I am unfit for state and majesty;\n"+
		"I do beseech you, take it not amiss;\n"+
		"I cannot nor I will not yield to you.\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"If you refuse it,--as, in love and zeal,\n"+
		"Loath to depose the child, Your brother's son;\n"+
		"As well we know your tenderness of heart\n"+
		"And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,\n"+
		"Which we have noted in you to your kin,\n"+
		"And egally indeed to all estates,--\n"+
		"Yet whether you accept our suit or no,\n"+
		"Your brother's son shall never reign our king;\n"+
		"But we will plant some other in the throne,\n"+
		"To the disgrace and downfall of your house:\n"+
		"And in this resolution here we leave you.--\n"+
		"Come, citizens: 'zounds! I'll entreat no more.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"O, do not swear, my lord of Buckingham.\n"+
		"Exit BUCKINGHAM with the Citizens\n"+
		"CATESBY\n"+
		"Call them again, my lord, and accept their suit.\n"+
		"ANOTHER\n"+
		"Do, good my lord, lest all the land do rue it.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Would you enforce me to a world of care?\n"+
		"Well, call them again. I am not made of stone,\n"+
		"But penetrable to your. kind entreats,\n"+
		"Albeit against my conscience and my soul.\n"+
		"Re-enter BUCKINGHAM and the rest\n"+
		"Cousin of Buckingham, and you sage, grave men,\n"+
		"Since you will buckle fortune on my back,\n"+
		"To bear her burthen, whether I will or no,\n"+
		"I must have patience to endure the load:\n"+
		"But if black scandal or foul-faced reproach\n"+
		"Attend the sequel of your imposition,\n"+
		"Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me\n"+
		"From all the impure blots and stains thereof;\n"+
		"For God he knows, and you may partly see,\n"+
		"How far I am from the desire thereof.\n"+
		"Lord Mayor\n"+
		"God bless your grace! we see it, and will say it.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"In saying so, you shall but say the truth.\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Then I salute you with this kingly title:\n"+
		"Long live Richard, England's royal king!\n"+
		"Lord Mayor\n"+
		"Citizens\n"+
		"Amen.\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"To-morrow will it please you to be crown'd?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Even when you please, since you will have it so.\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"To-morrow, then, we will attend your grace:\n"+
		"And so most joyfully we take our leave.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Come, let us to our holy task again.\n"+
		"Farewell, good cousin; farewell, gentle friends.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT IV\n"+
		"SCENE I. Before the Tower.\n"+
		"Enter, on one side, QUEEN ELIZABETH, DUCHESS OF YORK, and DORSET; on the other, ANNE, Duchess of Gloucester, leading Lady Margaret Plantagenet, CLARENCE's young Daughter\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"Who m eets us here? my niece Plantagenet\n"+
		"Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester?\n"+
		"Now, for my life, she's wandering to the Tower,\n"+
		"On pure heart's love to greet the tender princes.\n"+
		"Daughter, well met.\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"God give your graces both\n"+
		"A happy and a joyful time of day!\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"As much to you, good sister! Whither away?\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"No farther than the Tower; and, as I guess,\n"+
		"Upon the like devotion as yourselves,\n"+
		"To gratulate the gentle princes there.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"Kind sister, thanks: we'll enter all together.\n"+
		"Enter BRAKENBURY\n"+
		"And, in good time, here the lieutenant comes.\n"+
		"Master lieutenant, pray you, by your leave,\n"+
		"How doth the prince, and my young son of York?\n"+
		"BRAKENBURY\n"+
		"Right well, dear madam. By your patience,\n"+
		"I may not suffer you to visit them;\n"+
		"The king hath straitly charged the contrary.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"The king! why, who's that?\n"+
		"BRAKENBURY\n"+
		"I cry you mercy: I mean the lord protector.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"The Lord protect him from that kingly title!\n"+
		"Hath he set bounds betwixt their love and me?\n"+
		"I am their mother; who should keep me from them?\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"I am their fathers mother; I will see them.\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"Their aunt I am in law, in love their mother:\n"+
		"Then bring me to their sights; I'll bear thy blame\n"+
		"And take thy office from thee, on my peril.\n"+
		"BRAKENBURY\n"+
		"No, madam, no; I may not leave it so:\n"+
		"I am bound by oath, and therefore pardon me.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"Enter LORD STANLEY\n"+
		"LORD STANLEY\n"+
		"Let me but meet you, ladies, one hour hence,\n"+
		"And I'll salute your grace of York as mother,\n"+
		"And reverend looker on, of two fair queens.\n"+
		"To LADY ANNE\n"+
		"Come, madam, you must straight to Westminster,\n"+
		"There to be crowned Richard's royal queen.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"O, cut my lace in sunder, that my pent heart\n"+
		"May have some scope to beat, or else I swoon\n"+
		"With this dead-killing news!\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"Despiteful tidings! O unpleasing news!\n"+
		"DORSET\n"+
		"Be of good cheer: mother, how fares your grace?\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"O Dorset, speak not to me, get thee hence!\n"+
		"Death and destruction dog thee at the heels;\n"+
		"Thy mother's name is ominous to children.\n"+
		"If thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas,\n"+
		"And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell\n"+
		"Go, hie thee, hie thee from this slaughter-house,\n"+
		"Lest thou increase the number of the dead;\n"+
		"And make me die the thrall of Margaret's curse,\n"+
		"Nor mother, wife, nor England's counted queen.\n"+
		"LORD STANLEY\n"+
		"Full of wise care is this your counsel, madam.\n"+
		"Take all the swift advantage of the hours;\n"+
		"You shall have letters from me to my son\n"+
		"To meet you on the way, and welcome you.\n"+
		"Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay.\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"O ill-dispersing wind of misery!\n"+
		"O my accursed womb, the bed of death!\n"+
		"A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world,\n"+
		"Whose unavoided eye is murderous.\n"+
		"LORD STANLEY\n"+
		"Come, madam, come; I in all haste was sent.\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"And I in all unwillingness will go.\n"+
		"I would to God that the inclusive verge\n"+
		"Of golden metal that must round my brow\n"+
		"Were red-hot steel, to sear me to the brain!\n"+
		"Anointed let me be with deadly venom,\n"+
		"And die, ere men can say, God save the queen!\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"Go, go, poor soul, I envy not thy glory\n"+
		"To feed my humour, wish thyself no harm.\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"No! why? When he that is my husband now\n"+
		"Came to me, as I follow'd Henry's corse,\n"+
		"When scarce the blood was well wash'd from his hands\n"+
		"Which issued from my other angel husband\n"+
		"And that dead saint which then I weeping follow'd;\n"+
		"O, when, I say, I look'd on Richard's face,\n"+
		"This was my wish: 'Be thou,' quoth I, ' accursed,\n"+
		"For making me, so young, so old a widow!\n"+
		"And, when thou wed'st, let sorrow haunt thy bed;\n"+
		"And be thy wife--if any be so mad--\n"+
		"As miserable by the life of thee\n"+
		"As thou hast made me by my dear lord's death!\n"+
		"Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,\n"+
		"Even in so short a space, my woman's heart\n"+
		"Grossly grew captive to his honey words\n"+
		"And proved the subject of my own soul's curse,\n"+
		"Which ever since hath kept my eyes from rest;\n"+
		"For never yet one hour in his bed\n"+
		"Have I enjoy'd the golden dew of sleep,\n"+
		"But have been waked by his timorous dreams.\n"+
		"Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick;\n"+
		"And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"Poor heart, adieu! I pity thy complaining.\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"No more than from my soul I mourn for yours.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"Farewell, thou woful welcomer of glory!\n"+
		"LADY ANNE\n"+
		"Adieu, poor soul, that takest thy leave of it!\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"[To DORSET]\n"+

		"To LADY ANNE\n"+
		"Go thou to Richard, and good angels guard thee!\n"+
		"To QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"Go thou to sanctuary, and good thoughts possess thee!\n"+
		"I to my grave, where peace and rest lie with me!\n"+
		"Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,\n"+
		"And each hour's joy wrecked with a week of teen.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"Stay, yet look back with me unto the Tower.\n"+
		"Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes\n"+
		"Whom envy hath immured within your walls!\n"+
		"Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!\n"+
		"Rude ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow\n"+
		"For tender princes, use my babies well!\n"+
		"So foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell.\n"+

		"Well, let that pass. Dorset is fled to Richmond.\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"I hear that news, my lord.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Stanley, he is your wife's son well, look to it.\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"My lord, I claim your gift, my due by promise,\n"+

		"What says your highness to my just demand?\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"As I remember, Henry the Sixth\n"+

		"When Richmond was a little peevish boy.\n"+
		"A king, perhaps, perhaps,--\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"My lord!\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"How chance the prophet could not at that time\n"+
		"Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him?\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"My lord, your promise for the earldom,--\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Richmond! When last I was at Exeter,\n"+
		"The mayor in courtesy show'd me the castle,\n"+

		"Well, but what's o'clock?\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Upon the stroke of ten.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Well, let it strike.\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Why let it strike?\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Because that, like a Jack, thou keep'st the stroke\n"+
		"Betwixt thy begging and my meditation.\n"+
		"I am not in the giving vein to-day.\n"+

		"Why, then resolve me whether you will or no.\n"+

		"TYRREL\n"+
		"The tyrannous and bloody deed is done.\n"+

		"To do this ruthless piece of butchery,\n"+
		"Although they were flesh'd villains, bloody dogs,\n"+
		"Melting with tenderness and kind compassion\n"+

		"'Lo, thus' quoth Dighton, 'lay those tender babes:'\n"+
		"'Thus, thus,' quoth Forrest, 'girdling one another\n"+
		"Within their innocent alabaster arms:\n"+
		"Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,\n"+
		"Which in their summer beauty kiss'd each other.\n"+
		"A book of prayers on their pillow lay;\n"+
		"Which once,' quoth Forrest, 'almost changed my mind;\n"+
		"But O! the devil'--there the villain stopp'd\n"+
		"Whilst Dighton thus told on: 'We smothered\n"+
		"The most replenished sweet work of nature,\n"+
		"That from the prime creation e'er she framed.'\n"+
		"Thus both are gone with conscience and remorse;\n"+
		"They could not speak; and so I left them both,\n"+

		"Beget your happiness, be happy then,\n"+
		"For it is done, my lord.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"But didst thou see them dead?\n"+
		"TYRREL\n"+
		"I did, my lord.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"And buried, gentle Tyrrel?\n"+
		"TYRREL\n"+
		"The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them;\n"+
		"But how or in what place I do not know.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Come to me, Tyrrel, soon at after supper,\n"+
		"And thou shalt tell the process of their death.\n"+
		"Meantime, but think how I may do thee good,\n"+
		"And be inheritor of thy desire.\n"+
		"Farewell till soon.\n"+

		"To her I go, a jolly thriving wooer.\n"+
		"Enter CATESBY\n"+
		"CATESBY\n"+
		"My lord!\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Good news or bad, that thou comest in so bluntly?\n"+
		"CATESBY\n"+
		"Bad news, my lord: Ely is fled to Richmond;\n"+
		"And Buckingham, back'd with the hardy Welshmen,\n"+
		"Is in the field, and still his power increaseth.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Ely with Richmond troubles me more near\n"+
		"Than Buckingham and his rash-levied army.\n"+
		"Come, I have heard that fearful commenting\n"+
		"Is leaden servitor to dull delay;\n"+
		"Delay leads impotent and snail-paced beggary\n"+
		"Then fiery expedition be my wing,\n"+
		"Jove's Mercury, and herald for a king!\n"+

		"Enter QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"So, now prosperity begins to mellow\n"+
		"And drop into the rotten mouth of death.\n"+
		"Here in these confines slily have I lurk'd,\n"+
		"To watch the waning of mine adversaries.\n"+
		"A dire induction am I witness to,\n"+
		"And will to France, hoping the consequence\n"+
		"Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical.\n"+
		"Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret: who comes here?\n"+
		"Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH and the DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"Ah, my young princes! ah, my tender babes!\n"+
		"My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets!\n"+
		"If yet your gentle souls fly in the air\n"+
		"And be not fix'd in doom perpetual,\n"+
		"Hover about me with your airy wings\n"+
		"And hear your mother's lamentation!\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Hover about her; say, that right for right\n"+
		"Hath dimm'd your infant morn to aged night.\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"So many miseries have crazed my voice,\n"+
		"That my woe-wearied tongue is mute and dumb,\n"+
		"Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet.\n"+
		"Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"Wilt thou, O God, fly from such gentle lambs,\n"+
		"And throw them in the entrails of the wolf?\n"+
		"When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done?\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"When holy Harry died, and my sweet son.\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"Blind sight, dead life, poor mortal living ghost,\n"+
		"Woe's scene, world's shame, grave's due by life usurp'd,\n"+
		"Brief abstract and record of tedious days,\n"+
		"Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,\n"+
		"Sitting down\n"+
		"Unlawfully made drunk with innocents' blood!\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"O, that thou wouldst as well afford a grave\n"+
		"As thou canst yield a melancholy seat!\n"+
		"Then would I hide my bones, not rest them here.\n"+
		"O, who hath any cause to mourn but I?\n"+
		"Sitting down by her\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"If ancient sorrow be most reverend,\n"+
		"Give mine the benefit of seniory,\n"+
		"And let my woes frown on the upper hand.\n"+
		"If sorrow can admit society,\n"+
		"Sitting down with them\n"+
		"Tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine:\n"+
		"I had an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;\n"+
		"I had a Harry, till a Richard kill'd him:\n"+
		"Thou hadst an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;\n"+
		"Thou hadst a Richard, till a Richard killed him;\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"I had a Richard too, and thou didst kill him;\n"+
		"I had a Rutland too, thou holp'st to kill him.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard kill'd him.\n"+
		"From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept\n"+
		"A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death:\n"+
		"That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes,\n"+
		"To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood,\n"+
		"That foul defacer of God's handiwork,\n"+
		"That excellent grand tyrant of the earth,\n"+
		"That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls,\n"+
		"Thy womb let loose, to chase us to our graves.\n"+
		"O upright, just, and true-disposing God,\n"+
		"How do I thank thee, that this carnal cur\n"+
		"Preys on the issue of his mother's body,\n"+
		"And makes her pew-fellow with others' moan!\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"O Harry's wife, triumph not in my woes!\n"+
		"God witness with me, I have wept for thine.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Bear with me; I am hungry for revenge,\n"+
		"And now I cloy me with beholding it.\n"+
		"Thy Edward he is dead, that stabb'd my Edward:\n"+
		"Thy other Edward dead, to quit my Edward;\n"+
		"Young York he is but boot, because both they\n"+
		"Match not the high perfection of my loss:\n"+
		"Thy Clarence he is dead that kill'd my Edward;\n"+
		"And the beholders of this tragic play,\n"+
		"The adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey,\n"+
		"Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves.\n"+
		"Richard yet lives, hell's black intelligencer,\n"+
		"Only reserved their factor, to buy souls\n"+
		"And send them thither: but at hand, at hand,\n"+
		"Ensues his piteous and unpitied end:\n"+
		"Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray.\n"+
		"To have him suddenly convey'd away.\n"+
		"Cancel his bond of life, dear God, I prey,\n"+
		"That I may live to say, The dog is dead!\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"O, thou didst prophesy the time would come\n"+
		"That I should wish for thee to help me curse\n"+
		"That bottled spider, that foul bunch-back'd toad!\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"I call'd thee then vain flourish of my fortune;\n"+
		"I call'd thee then poor shadow, painted queen;\n"+
		"The presentation of but what I was;\n"+
		"The flattering index of a direful pageant;\n"+
		"One heaved a-high, to be hurl'd down below;\n"+
		"A mother only mock'd with two sweet babes;\n"+
		"A dream of what thou wert, a breath, a bubble,\n"+
		"A sign of dignity, a garish flag,\n"+
		"To be the aim of every dangerous shot,\n"+
		"A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.\n"+
		"Where is thy husband now? where be thy brothers?\n"+
		"Where are thy children? wherein dost thou, joy?\n"+
		"Who sues to thee and cries 'God save the queen'?\n"+
		"Where be the bending peers that flatter'd thee?\n"+
		"Where be the thronging troops that follow'd thee?\n"+
		"Decline all this, and see what now thou art:\n"+
		"For happy wife, a most distressed widow;\n"+
		"For joyful mother, one that wails the name;\n"+
		"For queen, a very caitiff crown'd with care;\n"+
		"For one being sued to, one that humbly sues;\n"+
		"For one that scorn'd at me, now scorn'd of me;\n"+
		"For one being fear'd of all, now fearing one;\n"+
		"For one commanding all, obey'd of none.\n"+
		"Thus hath the course of justice wheel'd about,\n"+
		"And left thee but a very prey to time;\n"+
		"Having no more but thought of what thou wert,\n"+
		"To torture thee the more, being what thou art.\n"+
		"Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not\n"+
		"Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?\n"+
		"Now thy proud neck bears half my burthen'd yoke;\n"+
		"From which even here I slip my weary neck,\n"+
		"And leave the burthen of it all on thee.\n"+
		"Farewell, York's wife, and queen of sad mischance:\n"+
		"These English woes will make me smile in France.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"O thou well skill'd in curses, stay awhile,\n"+
		"And teach me how to curse mine enemies!\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the days;\n"+
		"Compare dead happiness with living woe;\n"+
		"Think that thy babes were fairer than they were,\n"+
		"And he that slew them fouler than he is:\n"+
		"Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse:\n"+
		"Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"My words are dull; O, quicken them with thine!\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Thy woes will make them sharp, and pierce like mine.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"Why should calamity be full of words?\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"Windy attorneys to their client woes,\n"+
		"Airy succeeders of intestate joys,\n"+
		"Poor breathing orators of miseries!\n"+
		"Let them have scope: though what they do impart\n"+
		"Help not all, yet do they ease the heart.\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"If so, then be not tongue-tied: go with me.\n"+
		"And in the breath of bitter words let's smother\n"+
		"My damned son, which thy two sweet sons smother'd.\n"+
		"I hear his drum: be copious in exclaims.\n"+
		"Enter KING RICHARD III, marching, with drums and trumpets\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Who intercepts my expedition?\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"O, she that might have intercepted thee,\n"+
		"By strangling thee in her accursed womb\n"+
		"From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done!\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"Hidest thou that forehead with a golden crown,\n"+
		"Where should be graven, if that right were right,\n"+
		"The slaughter of the prince that owed that crown,\n"+
		"And the dire death of my two sons and brothers?\n"+
		"Tell me, thou villain slave, where are my children?\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother Clarence?\n"+
		"And little Ned Plantagenet, his son?\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"Where is kind Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey?\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"A flourish, trumpets! strike alarum, drums!\n"+
		"Let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women\n"+
		"Rail on the Lord's enointed: strike, I say!\n"+
		"Flourish. Alarums\n"+
		"Either be patient, and entreat me fair,\n"+
		"Or with the clamorous report of war\n"+
		"Thus will I drown your exclamations.\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"Art thou my son?\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Ay, I thank God, my father, and yourself.\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"Then patiently hear my impatience.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Madam, I have a touch of your condition,\n"+
		"Which cannot brook the accent of reproof.\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"O, let me speak!\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Do then: but I'll not hear.\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"I will be mild and gentle in my speech.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"And brief, good mother; for I am in haste.\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"Art thou so hasty? I have stay'd for thee,\n"+
		"God knows, in anguish, pain and agony.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"And came I not at last to comfort you?\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"No, by the holy rood, thou know'st it well,\n"+
		"Thou camest on earth to make the earth my hell.\n"+
		"A grievous burthen was thy birth to me;\n"+
		"Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;\n"+
		"Thy school-days frightful, desperate, wild, and furious,\n"+
		"Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous,\n"+
		"Thy age confirm'd, proud, subdued, bloody,\n"+
		"treacherous,\n"+
		"More mild, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred:\n"+
		"What comfortable hour canst thou name,\n"+
		"That ever graced me in thy company?\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Faith, none, but Humphrey Hour, that call'd\n"+
		"your grace\n"+
		"To breakfast once forth of my company.\n"+
		"If I be so disgracious in your sight,\n"+
		"Let me march on, and not offend your grace.\n"+
		"Strike the drum.\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"I prithee, hear me speak.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"You speak too bitterly.\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"Hear me a word;\n"+
		"For I shall never speak to thee again.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"So.\n"+
		"DUCHESS OF YORK\n"+
		"Either thou wilt die, by God's just ordinance,\n"+
		"Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror,\n"+
		"Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish\n"+
		"And never look upon thy face again.\n"+
		"Therefore take with thee my most heavy curse;\n"+
		"Which, in the day of battle, tire thee more\n"+
		"Than all the complete armour that thou wear'st!\n"+
		"My prayers on the adverse party fight;\n"+
		"And there the little souls of Edward's children\n"+
		"Whisper the spirits of thine enemies\n"+
		"And promise them success and victory.\n"+
		"Bloody thou art, bloody will be thy end;\n"+
		"Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"Though far more cause, yet much less spirit to curse\n"+
		"Abides in me; I say amen to all.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Stay, madam; I must speak a word with you.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"I have no more sons of the royal blood\n"+
		"For thee to murder: for my daughters, Richard,\n"+
		"They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens;\n"+
		"And therefore level not to hit their lives.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"You have a daughter call'd Elizabeth,\n"+
		"Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"And must she die for this? O, let her live,\n"+
		"And I'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty;\n"+
		"Slander myself as false to Edward's bed;\n"+
		"Throw over her the veil of infamy:\n"+
		"So she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter,\n"+
		"I will confess she was not Edward's daughter.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Wrong not her birth, she is of royal blood.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"To save her life, I'll say she is not so.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Her life is only safest in her birth.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"And only in that safety died her brothers.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Lo, at their births good stars were opposite.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"No, to their lives bad friends were contrary.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"All unavoided is the doom of destiny.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"True, when avoided grace makes destiny:\n"+
		"My babes were destined to a fairer death,\n"+
		"If grace had bless'd thee with a fairer life.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"You speak as if that I had slain my cousins.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"Cousins, indeed; and by their uncle cozen'd\n"+
		"Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life.\n"+
		"Whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts,\n"+
		"Thy head, all indirectly, gave direction:\n"+
		"No doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt\n"+
		"Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart,\n"+
		"To revel in the entrails of my lambs.\n"+
		"But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame,\n"+
		"My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys\n"+
		"Till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes;\n"+
		"And I, in such a desperate bay of death,\n"+
		"Like a poor bark, of sails and tackling reft,\n"+
		"Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise\n"+
		"And dangerous success of bloody wars,\n"+
		"As I intend more good to you and yours,\n"+
		"Than ever you or yours were by me wrong'd!\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"What good is cover'd with the face of heaven,\n"+
		"To be discover'd, that can do me good?\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"The advancement of your children, gentle lady.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads?\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"No, to the dignity and height of honour\n"+
		"The high imperial type of this earth's glory.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"Flatter my sorrows with report of it;\n"+
		"Tell me what state, what dignity, what honour,\n"+
		"Canst thou demise to any child of mine?\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Even all I have; yea, and myself and all,\n"+
		"Will I withal endow a child of thine;\n"+
		"So in the Lethe of thy angry soul\n"+
		"Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs\n"+
		"Which thou supposest I have done to thee.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"Be brief, lest that be process of thy kindness\n"+
		"Last longer telling than thy kindness' date.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Then know, that from my soul I love thy daughter.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"My daughter's mother thinks it with her soul.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"What do you think?\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul:\n"+
		"So from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers;\n"+
		"And from my heart's love I do thank thee for it.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Be not so hasty to confound my meaning:\n"+
		"I mean, that with my soul I love thy daughter,\n"+
		"And mean to make her queen of England.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"Say then, who dost thou mean shall be her king?\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Even he that makes her queen who should be else?\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"What, thou?\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"I, even I: what think you of it, madam?\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"How canst thou woo her?\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"That would I learn of you,\n"+
		"As one that are best acquainted with her humour.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"And wilt thou learn of me?\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Madam, with all my heart.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"Send to her, by the man that slew her brothers,\n"+
		"A pair of bleeding-hearts; thereon engrave\n"+
		"Edward and York; then haply she will weep:\n"+
		"Therefore present to her--as sometime Margaret\n"+
		"Did to thy father, steep'd in Rutland's blood,--\n"+
		"A handkerchief; which, say to her, did drain\n"+
		"The purple sap from her sweet brother's body\n"+
		"And bid her dry her weeping eyes therewith.\n"+
		"If this inducement force her not to love,\n"+
		"Send her a story of thy noble acts;\n"+
		"Tell her thou madest away her uncle Clarence,\n"+
		"Her uncle Rivers; yea, and, for her sake,\n"+
		"Madest quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Come, come, you mock me; this is not the way\n"+
		"To win our daughter.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"There is no other way\n"+
		"Unless thou couldst put on some other shape,\n"+
		"And not be Richard that hath done all this.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Say that I did all this for love of her.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee,\n"+
		"Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Look, what is done cannot be now amended:\n"+
		"Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,\n"+
		"Which after hours give leisure to repent.\n"+
		"If I did take the kingdom from your sons,\n"+
		"To make amends, Ill give it to your daughter.\n"+
		"If I have kill'd the issue of your womb,\n"+
		"To quicken your increase, I will beget\n"+
		"Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter\n"+
		"A grandam's name is little less in love\n"+
		"Than is the doting title of a mother;\n"+
		"They are as children but one step below,\n"+
		"Even of your mettle, of your very blood;\n"+
		"Of an one pain, save for a night of groans\n"+
		"Endured of her, for whom you bid like sorrow.\n"+
		"Your children were vexation to your youth,\n"+
		"But mine shall be a comfort to your age.\n"+
		"The loss you have is but a son being king,\n"+
		"And by that loss your daughter is made queen.\n"+
		"I cannot make you what amends I would,\n"+
		"Therefore accept such kindness as I can.\n"+
		"Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul\n"+
		"Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,\n"+
		"This fair alliance quickly shall call home\n"+
		"To high promotions and great dignity:\n"+
		"The king, that calls your beauteous daughter wife.\n"+
		"Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother;\n"+
		"Again shall you be mother to a king,\n"+
		"And all the ruins of distressful times\n"+
		"Repair'd with double riches of content.\n"+
		"What! we have many goodly days to see:\n"+
		"The liquid drops of tears that you have shed\n"+
		"Shall come again, transform'd to orient pearl,\n"+
		"Advantaging their loan with interest\n"+
		"Of ten times double gain of happiness.\n"+
		"Go, then my mother, to thy daughter go\n"+
		"Make bold her bashful years with your experience;\n"+
		"Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale\n"+
		"Put in her tender heart the aspiring flame\n"+
		"Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the princess\n"+
		"With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys\n"+
		"And when this arm of mine hath chastised\n"+
		"The petty rebel, dull-brain'd Buckingham,\n"+
		"Bound with triumphant garlands will I come\n"+
		"And lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed;\n"+
		"To whom I will retail my conquest won,\n"+
		"And she shall be sole victress, Caesar's Caesar.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"What were I best to say? her father's brother\n"+
		"Would be her lord? or shall I say, her uncle?\n"+
		"Or, he that slew her brothers and her uncles?\n"+
		"Under what title shall I woo for thee,\n"+
		"That God, the law, my honour and her love,\n"+
		"Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Infer fair England's peace by this alliance.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"Which she shall purchase with still lasting war.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Say that the king, which may command, entreats.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"That at her hands which the king's King forbids.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Say, she shall be a high and mighty queen.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"To wail the tide, as her mother doth.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Say, I will love her everlastingly.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"But how long shall that title 'ever' last?\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Sweetly in force unto her fair life's end.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"But how long fairly shall her sweet lie last?\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"So long as heaven and nature lengthens it.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"So long as hell and Richard likes of it.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Say, I, her sovereign, am her subject love.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"But she, your subject, loathes such sovereignty.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Be eloquent in my behalf to her.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"An honest tale speeds best being plainly told.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Then in plain terms tell her my loving tale.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"O no, my reasons are too deep and dead;\n"+
		"Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their grave.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Harp not on that string, madam; that is past.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"Harp on it still shall I till heart-strings break.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Now, by my George, my garter, and my crown,--\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"Profaned, dishonour'd, and the third usurp'd.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"I swear--\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"By nothing; for this is no oath:\n"+
		"The George, profaned, hath lost his holy honour;\n"+
		"The garter, blemish'd, pawn'd his knightly virtue;\n"+
		"The crown, usurp'd, disgraced his kingly glory.\n"+
		"if something thou wilt swear to be believed,\n"+
		"Swear then by something that thou hast not wrong'd.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Now, by the world--\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"'Tis full of thy foul wrongs.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"My father's death--\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"Thy life hath that dishonour'd.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Then, by myself--\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"Thyself thyself misusest.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Why then, by God--\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"God's wrong is most of all.\n"+
		"If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,\n"+
		"The unity the king thy brother made\n"+
		"Had not been broken, nor my brother slain:\n"+
		"If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,\n"+
		"The imperial metal, circling now thy brow,\n"+
		"Had graced the tender temples of my child,\n"+
		"And both the princes had been breathing here,\n"+
		"Which now, two tender playfellows to dust,\n"+
		"Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms.\n"+
		"What canst thou swear by now?\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"The time to come.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"That thou hast wronged in the time o'erpast;\n"+
		"For I myself have many tears to wash\n"+
		"Hereafter time, for time past wrong'd by thee.\n"+
		"The children live, whose parents thou hast\n"+
		"slaughter'd,\n"+
		"Ungovern'd youth, to wail it in their age;\n"+
		"The parents live, whose children thou hast butcher'd,\n"+
		"Old wither'd plants, to wail it with their age.\n"+
		"Swear not by time to come; for that thou hast\n"+
		"Misused ere used, by time misused o'erpast.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"As I intend to prosper and repent,\n"+
		"So thrive I in my dangerous attempt\n"+
		"Of hostile arms! myself myself confound!\n"+
		"Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours!\n"+
		"Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest!\n"+
		"Be opposite all planets of good luck\n"+
		"To my proceedings, if, with pure heart's love,\n"+
		"Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts,\n"+
		"I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter!\n"+
		"In her consists my happiness and thine;\n"+
		"Without her, follows to this land and me,\n"+
		"To thee, herself, and many a Christian soul,\n"+
		"Death, desolation, ruin and decay:\n"+
		"It cannot be avoided but by this;\n"+
		"It will not be avoided but by this.\n"+
		"Therefore, good mother,--I must can you so--\n"+
		"Be the attorney of my love to her:\n"+
		"Plead what I will be, not what I have been;\n"+
		"Not my deserts, but what I will deserve:\n"+
		"Urge the necessity and state of times,\n"+
		"And be not peevish-fond in great designs.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Ay, if the devil tempt thee to do good.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"Shall I forget myself to be myself?\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Ay, if yourself's remembrance wrong yourself.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"But thou didst kill my children.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"But in your daughter's womb I bury them:\n"+
		"Where in that nest of spicery they shall breed\n"+
		"Selves of themselves, to your recomforture.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"And be a happy mother by the deed.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"I go. Write to me very shortly.\n"+
		"And you shall understand from me her mind.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Bear her my true love's kiss; and so, farewell.\n"+
		"Exit QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"Relenting fool, and shallow, changing woman!\n"+
		"Enter RATCLIFF; CATESBY following\n"+
		"How now! what news?\n"+
		"RATCLIFF\n"+
		"My gracious sovereign, on the western coast\n"+
		"Rideth a puissant navy; to the shore\n"+
		"Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends,\n"+
		"Unarm'd, and unresolved to beat them back:\n"+
		"'Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral;\n"+
		"And there they hull, expecting but the aid\n"+
		"Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Some light-foot friend post to the Duke of Norfolk:\n"+
		"Ratcliff, thyself, or Catesby; where is he?\n"+
		"CATESBY\n"+
		"Here, my lord.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Fly to the duke:\n"+
		"To RATCLIFF\n"+
		"Post thou to Salisbury\n"+
		"When thou comest thither--\n"+
		"To CATESBY\n"+
		"Dull, unmindful villain,\n"+
		"Why stand'st thou still, and go'st not to the duke?\n"+
		"CATESBY\n"+
		"First, mighty sovereign, let me know your mind,\n"+
		"What from your grace I shall deliver to him.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"O, true, good Catesby: bid him levy straight\n"+
		"The greatest strength and power he can make,\n"+
		"And meet me presently at Salisbury.\n"+
		"CATESBY\n"+
		"I go.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"RATCLIFF\n"+
		"What is't your highness' pleasure I shall do at\n"+
		"Salisbury?\n"+

		"Enter STANLEY\n"+
		"How now, what news with you?\n"+
		"STANLEY\n"+
		"None good, my lord, to please you with the hearing;\n"+
		"Nor none so bad, but it may well be told.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Hoyday, a riddle! neither good nor bad!\n"+
		"Why dost thou run so many mile about,\n"+
		"When thou mayst tell thy tale a nearer way?\n"+
		"Once more, what news?\n"+
		"STANLEY\n"+
		"Richmond is on the seas.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"There let him sink, and be the seas on him!\n"+
		"White-liver'd runagate, what doth he there?\n"+
		"STANLEY\n"+
		"I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Well, sir, as you guess, as you guess?\n"+
		"STANLEY\n"+
		"Stirr'd up by Dorset, Buckingham, and Ely,\n"+
		"He makes for England, there to claim the crown.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Is the chair empty? is the sword unsway'd?\n"+
		"Is the king dead? the empire unpossess'd?\n"+
		"What heir of York is there alive but we?\n"+
		"And who is England's king but great York's heir?\n"+
		"Then, tell me, what doth he upon the sea?\n"+
		"STANLEY\n"+
		"Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Unless for that he comes to be your liege,\n"+
		"You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes.\n"+
		"Thou wilt revolt, and fly to him, I fear.\n"+
		"STANLEY\n"+
		"No, mighty liege; therefore mistrust me not.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Where is thy power, then, to beat him back?\n"+
		"Where are thy tenants and thy followers?\n"+
		"Are they not now upon the western shore.\n"+
		"Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships!\n"+
		"STANLEY\n"+
		"No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Cold friends to Richard: what do they in the north,\n"+

		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Well,\n"+
		"Go muster men; but, hear you, leave behind\n"+
		"Your son, George Stanley: look your faith be firm.\n"+

		"Upon his party: he, mistrusting them,\n"+

		"NORFOLK\n"+
		"Six or seven thousand is their utmost power.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"Why, our battalion trebles that account:\n"+

		"Much about cock-shut time, from troop to troop\n"+
		"Went through the army, cheering up the soldiers.\n"+
		"KING RICHARD III\n"+
		"So, I am satisfied. Give me a bowl of wine:\n"+
		"I have not that alacrity of spirit,\n"+

		"Set it down. Is ink and paper ready?\n"+
		"RATCLIFF\n"+
		"It is, my lord.\n"+

		"Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction,\n"+
		"That long have frown'd upon their enmity!\n"+
		"What traitor hears me, and says not amen?\n"+
		"England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself;\n"+
		"The brother blindly shed the brother's blood,\n"+
		"The father rashly slaughter'd his own son,\n"+
		"The son, compell'd, been butcher to the sire:\n"+
		"All this divided York and Lancaster,\n"+
		"Divided in their dire division,\n"+
		"O, now, let Richmond and Elizabeth,\n"+
		"The true succeeders of each royal house,\n"+
		"By God's fair ordinance conjoin together!\n"+
		"And let their heirs, God, if thy will be so.\n"+
		"Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,\n"+
		"With smiling plenty and fair prosperous days!\n"+
		"Abate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord,\n"+
		"That would reduce these bloody days again,\n"+
		"And make poor England weep in streams of blood!\n"+
		"Let them not live to taste this land's increase\n"+
		"That would with treason wound this fair land's peace!\n"+
		"Now civil wounds are stopp'd, peace lives again:\n"+
