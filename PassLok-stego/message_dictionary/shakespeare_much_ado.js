		"Much Ado About Nothing\n"+
		"ACT I\n"+
		"SCENE I. Before LEONATO'S house.\n"+
		"Enter LEONATO, HERO, and BEATRICE, with a Messenger\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"I learn in this letter that Don Peter of Arragon\n"+
		"comes this night to Messina.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"He is very near by this: he was not three leagues off\n"+
		"when I left him.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"But few of any sort, and none of name.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings\n"+
		"home full numbers. I find here that Don Peter hath\n"+
		"bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Much deserved on his part and equally remembered by\n"+
		"Don Pedro: he hath borne himself beyond the\n"+
		"promise of his age, doing, in the figure of a lamb,\n"+
		"the feats of a lion: he hath indeed better\n"+
		"bettered expectation than you must expect of me to\n"+
		"tell you how.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much\n"+
		"glad of it.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"I have already delivered him letters, and there\n"+
		"appears much joy in him; even so much that joy could\n"+
		"not show itself modest enough without a badge of\n"+
		"bitterness.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Did he break out into tears?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"In great measure.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"A kind overflow of kindness: there are no faces\n"+
		"truer than those that are so washed. How much\n"+
		"better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"I pray you, is Signior Mountanto returned from the\n"+
		"wars or no?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"I know none of that name, lady: there was none such\n"+
		"in the army of any sort.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"What is he that you ask for, niece?\n"+
		"HERO\n"+
		"My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"O, he's returned; and as pleasant as ever he was.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged\n"+
		"Cupid at the flight; and my uncle's fool, reading\n"+
		"the challenge, subscribed for Cupid, and challenged\n"+
		"him at the bird-bolt. I pray you, how many hath he\n"+
		"killed and eaten in these wars? But how many hath\n"+
		"he killed? for indeed I promised to eat all of his killing.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much;\n"+
		"but he'll be meet with you, I doubt it not.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it:\n"+
		"he is a very valiant trencherman; he hath an\n"+
		"excellent stomach.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"And a good soldier too, lady.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"And a good soldier to a lady: but what is he to a lord?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"A lord to a lord, a man to a man; stuffed with all\n"+
		"honourable virtues.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"It is so, indeed; he is no less than a stuffed man:\n"+
		"but for the stuffing,--well, we are all mortal.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a\n"+
		"kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her:\n"+
		"they never meet but there's a skirmish of wit\n"+
		"between them.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"Alas! he gets nothing by that. In our last\n"+
		"conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and\n"+
		"now is the whole man governed with one: so that if\n"+
		"he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him\n"+
		"bear it for a difference between himself and his\n"+
		"horse; for it is all the wealth that he hath left,\n"+
		"to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his\n"+
		"companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Is't possible?\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"Very easily possible: he wears his faith but as\n"+
		"the fashion of his hat; it ever changes with the\n"+
		"next block.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"No; an he were, I would burn my study. But, I pray\n"+
		"you, who is his companion? Is there no young\n"+
		"squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease: he\n"+
		"is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker\n"+
		"runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! if\n"+
		"he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a\n"+
		"thousand pound ere a' be cured.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"I will hold friends with you, lady.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"Do, good friend.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"You will never run mad, niece.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"No, not till a hot January.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Don Pedro is approached.\n"+
		"Enter DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, and BALTHASAR\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Good Signior Leonato, you are come to meet your\n"+
		"trouble: the fashion of the world is to avoid\n"+
		"cost, and you encounter it.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of\n"+
		"your grace: for trouble being gone, comfort should\n"+
		"remain; but when you depart from me, sorrow abides\n"+
		"and happiness takes his leave.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this\n"+
		"is your daughter.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Her mother hath many times told me so.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Signior Benedick, no; for then were you a child.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"You have it full, Benedick: we may guess by this\n"+
		"what you are, being a man. Truly, the lady fathers\n"+
		"herself. Be happy, lady; for you are like an\n"+
		"honourable father.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not\n"+
		"have his head on her shoulders for all Messina, as\n"+
		"like him as she is.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior\n"+
		"Benedick: nobody marks you.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"What, my dear Lady Disdain! are you yet living?\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"Is it possible disdain should die while she hath\n"+
		"such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick?\n"+
		"Courtesy itself must convert to disdain, if you come\n"+
		"in her presence.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I\n"+
		"am loved of all ladies, only you excepted: and I\n"+
		"would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard\n"+
		"heart; for, truly, I love none.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"A dear happiness to women: they would else have\n"+
		"been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God\n"+
		"and my cold blood, I am of your humour for that: I\n"+
		"had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man\n"+
		"swear he loves me.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"God keep your ladyship still in that mind! so some\n"+
		"gentleman or other shall 'scape a predestinate\n"+
		"scratched face.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"Scratching could not make it worse, an 'twere such\n"+
		"a face as yours were.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"I would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and\n"+
		"so good a continuer. But keep your way, i' God's\n"+
		"name; I have done.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"You always end with a jade's trick: I know you of old.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"That is the sum of all, Leonato. Signior Claudio\n"+
		"and Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath\n"+
		"invited you all. I tell him we shall stay here at\n"+
		"the least a month; and he heartily prays some\n"+
		"occasion may detain us longer. I dare swear he is no\n"+
		"hypocrite, but prays from his heart.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn.\n"+
		"To DON JOHN\n"+
		"Let me bid you welcome, my lord: being reconciled to\n"+
		"the prince your brother, I owe you all duty.\n"+
		"DON JOHN\n"+
		"I thank you: I am not of many words, but I thank\n"+
		"you.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Please it your grace lead on?\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Your hand, Leonato; we will go together.\n"+
		"Exeunt all except BENEDICK and CLAUDIO\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato?\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"I noted her not; but I looked on her.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Is she not a modest young lady?\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Do you question me, as an honest man should do, for\n"+
		"my simple true judgment; or would you have me speak\n"+
		"after my custom, as being a professed tyrant to their sex?\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"No; I pray thee speak in sober judgment.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Why, i' faith, methinks she's too low for a high\n"+
		"praise, too brown for a fair praise and too little\n"+
		"for a great praise: only this commendation I can\n"+
		"afford her, that were she other than she is, she\n"+
		"were unhandsome; and being no other but as she is, I\n"+
		"do not like her.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Thou thinkest I am in sport: I pray thee tell me\n"+
		"truly how thou likest her.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Would you buy her, that you inquire after her?\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Can the world buy such a jewel?\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Yea, and a case to put it into. But speak you this\n"+
		"with a sad brow? or do you play the flouting Jack,\n"+
		"to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder and Vulcan a\n"+
		"rare carpenter? Come, in what key shall a man take\n"+
		"you, to go in the song?\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I\n"+
		"looked on.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"I can see yet without spectacles and I see no such\n"+
		"matter: there's her cousin, an she were not\n"+
		"possessed with a fury, exceeds her as much in beauty\n"+
		"as the first of May doth the last of December. But I\n"+
		"hope you have no intent to turn husband, have you?\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn the\n"+
		"contrary, if Hero would be my wife.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Is't come to this? In faith, hath not the world\n"+
		"one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion?\n"+
		"Shall I never see a bachelor of three-score again?\n"+
		"Go to, i' faith; an thou wilt needs thrust thy neck\n"+
		"into a yoke, wear the print of it and sigh away\n"+
		"Sundays. Look Don Pedro is returned to seek you.\n"+
		"Re-enter DON PEDRO\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"What secret hath held you here, that you followed\n"+
		"not to Leonato's?\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"I would your grace would constrain me to tell.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"I charge thee on thy allegiance.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"You hear, Count Claudio: I can be secret as a dumb\n"+
		"man; I would have you think so; but, on my\n"+
		"allegiance, mark you this, on my allegiance. He is\n"+
		"in love. With who? now that is your grace's part.\n"+
		"Mark how short his answer is;--With Hero, Leonato's\n"+
		"short daughter.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"If this were so, so were it uttered.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Like the old tale, my lord: 'it is not so, nor\n"+
		"'twas not so, but, indeed, God forbid it should be\n"+
		"so.'\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"If my passion change not shortly, God forbid it\n"+
		"should be otherwise.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Amen, if you love her; for the lady is very well worthy.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"By my troth, I speak my thought.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"And, in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"And, by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"That I love her, I feel.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"That she is worthy, I know.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"That I neither feel how she should be loved nor\n"+
		"know how she should be worthy, is the opinion that\n"+
		"fire cannot melt out of me: I will die in it at the stake.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite\n"+
		"of beauty.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"And never could maintain his part but in the force\n"+
		"of his will.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"That a woman conceived me, I thank her; that she\n"+
		"brought me up, I likewise give her most humble\n"+
		"thanks: but that I will have a recheat winded in my\n"+
		"forehead, or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick,\n"+
		"all women shall pardon me. Because I will not do\n"+
		"them the wrong to mistrust any, I will do myself the\n"+
		"right to trust none; and the fine is, for the which\n"+
		"I may go the finer, I will live a bachelor.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"With anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord,\n"+
		"not with love: prove that ever I lose more blood\n"+
		"with love than I will get again with drinking, pick\n"+
		"out mine eyes with a ballad-maker's pen and hang me\n"+
		"up at the door of a brothel-house for the sign of\n"+
		"blind Cupid.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Well, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thou\n"+
		"wilt prove a notable argument.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"If I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot\n"+
		"at me; and he that hits me, let him be clapped on\n"+
		"the shoulder, and called Adam.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Well, as time shall try: 'In time the savage bull\n"+
		"doth bear the yoke.'\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"The savage bull may; but if ever the sensible\n"+
		"Benedick bear it, pluck off the bull's horns and set\n"+
		"them in my forehead: and let me be vilely painted,\n"+
		"and in such great letters as they write 'Here is\n"+
		"good horse to hire,' let them signify under my sign\n"+
		"'Here you may see Benedick the married man.'\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"If this should ever happen, thou wouldst be horn-mad.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Nay, if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in\n"+
		"Venice, thou wilt quake for this shortly.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"I look for an earthquake too, then.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Well, you temporize with the hours. In the\n"+
		"meantime, good Signior Benedick, repair to\n"+
		"Leonato's: commend me to him and tell him I will\n"+
		"not fail him at supper; for indeed he hath made\n"+
		"great preparation.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"I have almost matter enough in me for such an\n"+
		"embassage; and so I commit you--\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"To the tuition of God: From my house, if I had it,--\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"The sixth of July: Your loving friend, Benedick.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Nay, mock not, mock not. The body of your\n"+
		"discourse is sometime guarded with fragments, and\n"+
		"the guards are but slightly basted on neither: ere\n"+
		"you flout old ends any further, examine your\n"+
		"conscience: and so I leave you.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"My liege, your highness now may do me good.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"My love is thine to teach: teach it but how,\n"+
		"And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn\n"+
		"Any hard lesson that may do thee good.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Hath Leonato any son, my lord?\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"No child but Hero; she's his only heir.\n"+
		"Dost thou affect her, Claudio?\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"O, my lord,\n"+
		"When you went onward on this ended action,\n"+
		"I look'd upon her with a soldier's eye,\n"+
		"That liked, but had a rougher task in hand\n"+
		"Than to drive liking to the name of love:\n"+
		"But now I am return'd and that war-thoughts\n"+
		"Have left their places vacant, in their rooms\n"+
		"Come thronging soft and delicate desires,\n"+
		"All prompting me how fair young Hero is,\n"+
		"Saying, I liked her ere I went to wars.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Thou wilt be like a lover presently\n"+
		"And tire the hearer with a book of words.\n"+
		"If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it,\n"+
		"And I will break with her and with her father,\n"+
		"And thou shalt have her. Was't not to this end\n"+
		"That thou began'st to twist so fine a story?\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"How sweetly you do minister to love,\n"+
		"That know love's grief by his complexion!\n"+
		"But lest my liking might too sudden seem,\n"+
		"I would have salved it with a longer treatise.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"What need the bridge much broader than the flood?\n"+
		"The fairest grant is the necessity.\n"+
		"Look, what will serve is fit: 'tis once, thou lovest,\n"+
		"And I will fit thee with the remedy.\n"+
		"I know we shall have revelling to-night:\n"+
		"I will assume thy part in some disguise\n"+
		"And tell fair Hero I am Claudio,\n"+
		"And in her bosom I'll unclasp my heart\n"+
		"And take her hearing prisoner with the force\n"+
		"And strong encounter of my amorous tale:\n"+
		"Then after to her father will I break;\n"+
		"And the conclusion is, she shall be thine.\n"+
		"In practise let us put it presently.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. A room in LEONATO's house.\n"+
		"Enter LEONATO and ANTONIO, meeting\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"How now, brother! Where is my cousin, your son?\n"+
		"hath he provided this music?\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"He is very busy about it. But, brother, I can tell\n"+
		"you strange news that you yet dreamt not of.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Are they good?\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"As the event stamps them: but they have a good\n"+
		"cover; they show well outward. The prince and Count\n"+
		"Claudio, walking in a thick-pleached alley in mine\n"+
		"orchard, were thus much overheard by a man of mine:\n"+
		"the prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my\n"+
		"niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it\n"+
		"this night in a dance: and if he found her\n"+
		"accordant, he meant to take the present time by the\n"+
		"top and instantly break with you of it.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Hath the fellow any wit that told you this?\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"A good sharp fellow: I will send for him; and\n"+
		"question him yourself.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"No, no; we will hold it as a dream till it appear\n"+
		"itself: but I will acquaint my daughter withal,\n"+
		"that she may be the better prepared for an answer,\n"+
		"if peradventure this be true. Go you and tell her of it.\n"+
		"Enter Attendants\n"+
		"Cousins, you know what you have to do. O, I cry you\n"+
		"mercy, friend; go you with me, and I will use your\n"+
		"skill. Good cousin, have a care this busy time.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. The same.\n"+
		"Enter DON JOHN and CONRADE\n"+
		"CONRADE\n"+
		"What the good-year, my lord! why are you thus out\n"+
		"of measure sad?\n"+
		"DON JOHN\n"+
		"There is no measure in the occasion that breeds;\n"+
		"therefore the sadness is without limit.\n"+
		"CONRADE\n"+
		"You should hear reason.\n"+
		"DON JOHN\n"+
		"And when I have heard it, what blessing brings it?\n"+
		"CONRADE\n"+
		"If not a present remedy, at least a patient\n"+
		"sufferance.\n"+
		"DON JOHN\n"+
		"I wonder that thou, being, as thou sayest thou art,\n"+
		"born under Saturn, goest about to apply a moral\n"+
		"medicine to a mortifying mischief. I cannot hide\n"+
		"what I am: I must be sad when I have cause and smile\n"+
		"at no man's jests, eat when I have stomach and wait\n"+
		"for no man's leisure, sleep when I am drowsy and\n"+
		"tend on no man's business, laugh when I am merry and\n"+
		"claw no man in his humour.\n"+
		"CONRADE\n"+
		"Yea, but you must not make the full show of this\n"+
		"till you may do it without controlment. You have of\n"+
		"late stood out against your brother, and he hath\n"+
		"ta'en you newly into his grace; where it is\n"+
		"impossible you should take true root but by the\n"+
		"fair weather that you make yourself: it is needful\n"+
		"that you frame the season for your own harvest.\n"+
		"DON JOHN\n"+
		"I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in\n"+
		"his grace, and it better fits my blood to be\n"+
		"disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob\n"+
		"love from any: in this, though I cannot be said to\n"+
		"be a flattering honest man, it must not be denied\n"+
		"but I am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with\n"+
		"a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog; therefore I\n"+
		"have decreed not to sing in my cage. If I had my\n"+
		"mouth, I would bite; if I had my liberty, I would do\n"+
		"my liking: in the meantime let me be that I am and\n"+
		"seek not to alter me.\n"+
		"CONRADE\n"+
		"Can you make no use of your discontent?\n"+
		"DON JOHN\n"+
		"I make all use of it, for I use it only.\n"+
		"Who comes here?\n"+
		"Enter BORACHIO\n"+
		"What news, Borachio?\n"+
		"BORACHIO\n"+
		"I came yonder from a great supper: the prince your\n"+
		"brother is royally entertained by Leonato: and I\n"+
		"can give you intelligence of an intended marriage.\n"+
		"DON JOHN\n"+
		"Will it serve for any model to build mischief on?\n"+
		"What is he for a fool that betroths himself to\n"+
		"unquietness?\n"+
		"BORACHIO\n"+
		"Marry, it is your brother's right hand.\n"+
		"DON JOHN\n"+
		"Who? the most exquisite Claudio?\n"+
		"BORACHIO\n"+
		"Even he.\n"+
		"DON JOHN\n"+
		"A proper squire! And who, and who? which way looks\n"+
		"he?\n"+
		"BORACHIO\n"+
		"Marry, on Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato.\n"+
		"DON JOHN\n"+
		"A very forward March-chick! How came you to this?\n"+
		"BORACHIO\n"+
		"Being entertained for a perfumer, as I was smoking a\n"+
		"musty room, comes me the prince and Claudio, hand\n"+
		"in hand in sad conference: I whipt me behind the\n"+
		"arras; and there heard it agreed upon that the\n"+
		"prince should woo Hero for himself, and having\n"+
		"obtained her, give her to Count Claudio.\n"+
		"DON JOHN\n"+
		"Come, come, let us thither: this may prove food to\n"+
		"my displeasure. That young start-up hath all the\n"+
		"glory of my overthrow: if I can cross him any way, I\n"+
		"bless myself every way. You are both sure, and will assist me?\n"+
		"CONRADE\n"+
		"To the death, my lord.\n"+
		"DON JOHN\n"+
		"Let us to the great supper: their cheer is the\n"+
		"greater that I am subdued. Would the cook were of\n"+
		"my mind! Shall we go prove what's to be done?\n"+
		"BORACHIO\n"+
		"We'll wait upon your lordship.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT II\n"+
		"SCENE I. A hall in LEONATO'S house.\n"+
		"Enter LEONATO, ANTONIO, HERO, BEATRICE, and others\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Was not Count John here at supper?\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"I saw him not.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"How tartly that gentleman looks! I never can see\n"+
		"him but I am heart-burned an hour after.\n"+
		"HERO\n"+
		"He is of a very melancholy disposition.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"He were an excellent man that were made just in the\n"+
		"midway between him and Benedick: the one is too\n"+
		"like an image and says nothing, and the other too\n"+
		"like my lady's eldest son, evermore tattling.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Then half Signior Benedick's tongue in Count John's\n"+
		"mouth, and half Count John's melancholy in Signior\n"+
		"Benedick's face,--\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money\n"+
		"enough in his purse, such a man would win any woman\n"+
		"in the world, if a' could get her good-will.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a\n"+
		"husband, if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"In faith, she's too curst.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"Too curst is more than curst: I shall lessen God's\n"+
		"sending that way; for it is said, 'God sends a curst\n"+
		"cow short horns;' but to a cow too curst he sends none.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"So, by being too curst, God will send you no horns.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"Just, if he send me no husband; for the which\n"+
		"blessing I am at him upon my knees every morning and\n"+
		"evening. Lord, I could not endure a husband with a\n"+
		"beard on his face: I had rather lie in the woollen.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"You may light on a husband that hath no beard.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"What should I do with him? dress him in my apparel\n"+
		"and make him my waiting-gentlewoman? He that hath a\n"+
		"beard is more than a youth, and he that hath no\n"+
		"beard is less than a man: and he that is more than\n"+
		"a youth is not for me, and he that is less than a\n"+
		"man, I am not for him: therefore, I will even take\n"+
		"sixpence in earnest of the bear-ward, and lead his\n"+
		"apes into hell.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Well, then, go you into hell?\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"No, but to the gate; and there will the devil meet\n"+
		"me, like an old cuckold, with horns on his head, and\n"+
		"say 'Get you to heaven, Beatrice, get you to\n"+
		"heaven; here's no place for you maids:' so deliver\n"+
		"I up my apes, and away to Saint Peter for the\n"+
		"heavens; he shows me where the bachelors sit, and\n"+
		"there live we as merry as the day is long.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"[To HERO] Well, niece, I trust you will be ruled\n"+
		"by your father.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"Yes, faith; it is my cousin's duty to make curtsy\n"+
		"and say 'Father, as it please you.' But yet for all\n"+
		"that, cousin, let him be a handsome fellow, or else\n"+
		"make another curtsy and say 'Father, as it please\n"+
		"me.'\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Well, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"Not till God make men of some other metal than\n"+
		"earth. Would it not grieve a woman to be\n"+
		"overmastered with a pierce of valiant dust? to make\n"+
		"an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl?\n"+
		"No, uncle, I'll none: Adam's sons are my brethren;\n"+
		"and, truly, I hold it a sin to match in my kindred.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Daughter, remember what I told you: if the prince\n"+
		"do solicit you in that kind, you know your answer.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be\n"+
		"not wooed in good time: if the prince be too\n"+
		"important, tell him there is measure in every thing\n"+
		"and so dance out the answer. For, hear me, Hero:\n"+
		"wooing, wedding, and repenting, is as a Scotch jig,\n"+
		"a measure, and a cinque pace: the first suit is hot\n"+
		"and hasty, like a Scotch jig, and full as\n"+
		"fantastical; the wedding, mannerly-modest, as a\n"+
		"measure, full of state and ancientry; and then comes\n"+
		"repentance and, with his bad legs, falls into the\n"+
		"cinque pace faster and faster, till he sink into his grave.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"I have a good eye, uncle; I can see a church by daylight.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"The revellers are entering, brother: make good room.\n"+
		"All put on their masks\n"+
		"Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, BALTHASAR, DON JOHN, BORACHIO, MARGARET, URSULA and others, masked\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Lady, will you walk about with your friend?\n"+
		"HERO\n"+
		"So you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing,\n"+
		"I am yours for the walk; and especially when I walk away.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"With me in your company?\n"+
		"HERO\n"+
		"I may say so, when I please.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"And when please you to say so?\n"+
		"HERO\n"+
		"When I like your favour; for God defend the lute\n"+
		"should be like the case!\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"My visor is Philemon's roof; within the house is Jove.\n"+
		"HERO\n"+
		"Why, then, your visor should be thatched.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Speak low, if you speak love.\n"+
		"Drawing her aside\n"+
		"BALTHASAR\n"+
		"Well, I would you did like me.\n"+
		"MARGARET\n"+
		"So would not I, for your own sake; for I have many\n"+
		"ill-qualities.\n"+
		"BALTHASAR\n"+
		"Which is one?\n"+
		"MARGARET\n"+
		"I say my prayers aloud.\n"+
		"BALTHASAR\n"+
		"I love you the better: the hearers may cry, Amen.\n"+
		"MARGARET\n"+
		"God match me with a good dancer!\n"+
		"BALTHASAR\n"+
		"Amen.\n"+
		"MARGARET\n"+
		"And God keep him out of my sight when the dance is\n"+
		"done! Answer, clerk.\n"+
		"BALTHASAR\n"+
		"No more words: the clerk is answered.\n"+
		"URSULA\n"+
		"I know you well enough; you are Signior Antonio.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"At a word, I am not.\n"+
		"URSULA\n"+
		"I know you by the waggling of your head.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"To tell you true, I counterfeit him.\n"+
		"URSULA\n"+
		"You could never do him so ill-well, unless you were\n"+
		"the very man. Here's his dry hand up and down: you\n"+
		"are he, you are he.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"At a word, I am not.\n"+
		"URSULA\n"+
		"Come, come, do you think I do not know you by your\n"+
		"excellent wit? can virtue hide itself? Go to,\n"+
		"mum, you are he: graces will appear, and there's an\n"+
		"end.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"Will you not tell me who told you so?\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"No, you shall pardon me.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"Nor will you not tell me who you are?\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Not now.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"That I was disdainful, and that I had my good wit\n"+
		"out of the 'Hundred Merry Tales:'--well this was\n"+
		"Signior Benedick that said so.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"What's he?\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"I am sure you know him well enough.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Not I, believe me.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"Did he never make you laugh?\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"I pray you, what is he?\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"Why, he is the prince's jester: a very dull fool;\n"+
		"only his gift is in devising impossible slanders:\n"+
		"none but libertines delight in him; and the\n"+
		"commendation is not in his wit, but in his villany;\n"+
		"for he both pleases men and angers them, and then\n"+
		"they laugh at him and beat him. I am sure he is in\n"+
		"the fleet: I would he had boarded me.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"When I know the gentleman, I'll tell him what you say.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"Do, do: he'll but break a comparison or two on me;\n"+
		"which, peradventure not marked or not laughed at,\n"+
		"strikes him into melancholy; and then there's a\n"+
		"partridge wing saved, for the fool will eat no\n"+
		"supper that night.\n"+
		"Music\n"+
		"We must follow the leaders.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"In every good thing.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"Nay, if they lead to any ill, I will leave them at\n"+
		"the next turning.\n"+
		"Dance. Then exeunt all except DON JOHN, BORACHIO, and CLAUDIO\n"+
		"DON JOHN\n"+
		"Sure my brother is amorous on Hero and hath\n"+
		"withdrawn her father to break with him about it.\n"+
		"The ladies follow her and but one visor remains.\n"+
		"BORACHIO\n"+
		"And that is Claudio: I know him by his bearing.\n"+
		"DON JOHN\n"+
		"Are not you Signior Benedick?\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"You know me well; I am he.\n"+
		"DON JOHN\n"+
		"Signior, you are very near my brother in his love:\n"+
		"he is enamoured on Hero; I pray you, dissuade him\n"+
		"from her: she is no equal for his birth: you may\n"+
		"do the part of an honest man in it.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"How know you he loves her?\n"+
		"DON JOHN\n"+
		"I heard him swear his affection.\n"+
		"BORACHIO\n"+
		"So did I too; and he swore he would marry her to-night.\n"+
		"DON JOHN\n"+
		"Come, let us to the banquet.\n"+
		"Exeunt DON JOHN and BORACHIO\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Thus answer I in the name of Benedick,\n"+
		"But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio.\n"+
		"'Tis certain so; the prince wooes for himself.\n"+
		"Friendship is constant in all other things\n"+
		"Save in the office and affairs of love:\n"+
		"Therefore, all hearts in love use their own tongues;\n"+
		"Let every eye negotiate for itself\n"+
		"And trust no agent; for beauty is a witch\n"+
		"Against whose charms faith melteth into blood.\n"+
		"This is an accident of hourly proof,\n"+
		"Which I mistrusted not. Farewell, therefore, Hero!\n"+
		"Re-enter BENEDICK\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Count Claudio?\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Yea, the same.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Come, will you go with me?\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Whither?\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Even to the next willow, about your own business,\n"+
		"county. What fashion will you wear the garland of?\n"+
		"about your neck, like an usurer's chain? or under\n"+
		"your arm, like a lieutenant's scarf? You must wear\n"+
		"it one way, for the prince hath got your Hero.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"I wish him joy of her.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Why, that's spoken like an honest drovier: so they\n"+
		"sell bullocks. But did you think the prince would\n"+
		"have served you thus?\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"I pray you, leave me.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Ho! now you strike like the blind man: 'twas the\n"+
		"boy that stole your meat, and you'll beat the post.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"If it will not be, I'll leave you.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Alas, poor hurt fowl! now will he creep into sedges.\n"+
		"But that my Lady Beatrice should know me, and not\n"+
		"know me! The prince's fool! Ha? It may be I go\n"+
		"under that title because I am merry. Yea, but so I\n"+
		"am apt to do myself wrong; I am not so reputed: it\n"+
		"is the base, though bitter, disposition of Beatrice\n"+
		"that puts the world into her person and so gives me\n"+
		"out. Well, I'll be revenged as I may.\n"+
		"Re-enter DON PEDRO\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Now, signior, where's the count? did you see him?\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Troth, my lord, I have played the part of Lady Fame.\n"+
		"I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a\n"+
		"warren: I told him, and I think I told him true,\n"+
		"that your grace had got the good will of this young\n"+
		"lady; and I offered him my company to a willow-tree,\n"+
		"either to make him a garland, as being forsaken, or\n"+
		"to bind him up a rod, as being worthy to be whipped.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"To be whipped! What's his fault?\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"The flat transgression of a schoolboy, who, being\n"+
		"overjoyed with finding a birds' nest, shows it his\n"+
		"companion, and he steals it.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Wilt thou make a trust a transgression? The\n"+
		"transgression is in the stealer.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made,\n"+
		"and the garland too; for the garland he might have\n"+
		"worn himself, and the rod he might have bestowed on\n"+
		"you, who, as I take it, have stolen his birds' nest.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"I will but teach them to sing, and restore them to\n"+
		"the owner.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"If their singing answer your saying, by my faith,\n"+
		"you say honestly.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you: the\n"+
		"gentleman that danced with her told her she is much\n"+
		"wronged by you.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"O, she misused me past the endurance of a block!\n"+
		"an oak but with one green leaf on it would have\n"+
		"answered her; my very visor began to assume life and\n"+
		"scold with her. She told me, not thinking I had been\n"+
		"myself, that I was the prince's jester, that I was\n"+
		"duller than a great thaw; huddling jest upon jest\n"+
		"with such impossible conveyance upon me that I stood\n"+
		"like a man at a mark, with a whole army shooting at\n"+
		"me. She speaks poniards, and every word stabs:\n"+
		"if her breath were as terrible as her terminations,\n"+
		"there were no living near her; she would infect to\n"+
		"the north star. I would not marry her, though she\n"+
		"were endowed with all that Adam bad left him before\n"+
		"he transgressed: she would have made Hercules have\n"+
		"turned spit, yea, and have cleft his club to make\n"+
		"the fire too. Come, talk not of her: you shall find\n"+
		"her the infernal Ate in good apparel. I would to God\n"+
		"some scholar would conjure her; for certainly, while\n"+
		"she is here, a man may live as quiet in hell as in a\n"+
		"sanctuary; and people sin upon purpose, because they\n"+
		"would go thither; so, indeed, all disquiet, horror\n"+
		"and perturbation follows her.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Look, here she comes.\n"+
		"Enter CLAUDIO, BEATRICE, HERO, and LEONATO\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Will your grace command me any service to the\n"+
		"world's end? I will go on the slightest errand now\n"+
		"to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on;\n"+
		"I will fetch you a tooth-picker now from the\n"+
		"furthest inch of Asia, bring you the length of\n"+
		"Prester John's foot, fetch you a hair off the great\n"+
		"Cham's beard, do you any embassage to the Pigmies,\n"+
		"rather than hold three words' conference with this\n"+
		"harpy. You have no employment for me?\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"None, but to desire your good company.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"O God, sir, here's a dish I love not: I cannot\n"+
		"endure my Lady Tongue.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Come, lady, come; you have lost the heart of\n"+
		"Signior Benedick.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"Indeed, my lord, he lent it me awhile; and I gave\n"+
		"him use for it, a double heart for his single one:\n"+
		"marry, once before he won it of me with false dice,\n"+
		"therefore your grace may well say I have lost it.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"You have put him down, lady, you have put him down.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"So I would not he should do me, my lord, lest I\n"+
		"should prove the mother of fools. I have brought\n"+
		"Count Claudio, whom you sent me to seek.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Why, how now, count! wherefore are you sad?\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Not sad, my lord.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"How then? sick?\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Neither, my lord.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"The count is neither sad, nor sick, nor merry, nor\n"+
		"well; but civil count, civil as an orange, and\n"+
		"something of that jealous complexion.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"I' faith, lady, I think your blazon to be true;\n"+
		"though, I'll be sworn, if he be so, his conceit is\n"+
		"false. Here, Claudio, I have wooed in thy name, and\n"+
		"fair Hero is won: I have broke with her father,\n"+
		"and his good will obtained: name the day of\n"+
		"marriage, and God give thee joy!\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Count, take of me my daughter, and with her my\n"+
		"fortunes: his grace hath made the match, and an\n"+
		"grace say Amen to it.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"Speak, count, 'tis your cue.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Silence is the perfectest herald of joy: I were\n"+
		"but little happy, if I could say how much. Lady, as\n"+
		"you are mine, I am yours: I give away myself for\n"+
		"you and dote upon the exchange.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"Speak, cousin; or, if you cannot, stop his mouth\n"+
		"with a kiss, and let not him speak neither.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"In faith, lady, you have a merry heart.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"Yea, my lord; I thank it, poor fool, it keeps on\n"+
		"the windy side of care. My cousin tells him in his\n"+
		"ear that he is in her heart.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"And so she doth, cousin.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"Good Lord, for alliance! Thus goes every one to the\n"+
		"world but I, and I am sunburnt; I may sit in a\n"+
		"corner and cry heigh-ho for a husband!\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Lady Beatrice, I will get you one.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"I would rather have one of your father's getting.\n"+
		"Hath your grace ne'er a brother like you? Your\n"+
		"father got excellent husbands, if a maid could come by them.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Will you have me, lady?\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"No, my lord, unless I might have another for\n"+
		"working-days: your grace is too costly to wear\n"+
		"every day. But, I beseech your grace, pardon me: I\n"+
		"was born to speak all mirth and no matter.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Your silence most offends me, and to be merry best\n"+
		"becomes you; for, out of question, you were born in\n"+
		"a merry hour.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"No, sure, my lord, my mother cried; but then there\n"+
		"was a star danced, and under that was I born.\n"+
		"Cousins, God give you joy!\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Niece, will you look to those things I told you of?\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"I cry you mercy, uncle. By your grace's pardon.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"By my troth, a pleasant-spirited lady.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"There's little of the melancholy element in her, my\n"+
		"lord: she is never sad but when she sleeps, and\n"+
		"not ever sad then; for I have heard my daughter say,\n"+
		"she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked\n"+
		"herself with laughing.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"O, by no means: she mocks all her wooers out of suit.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"She were an excellent wife for Benedict.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"O Lord, my lord, if they were but a week married,\n"+
		"they would talk themselves mad.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"County Claudio, when mean you to go to church?\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"To-morrow, my lord: time goes on crutches till love\n"+
		"have all his rites.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Not till Monday, my dear son, which is hence a just\n"+
		"seven-night; and a time too brief, too, to have all\n"+
		"things answer my mind.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Come, you shake the head at so long a breathing:\n"+
		"but, I warrant thee, Claudio, the time shall not go\n"+
		"dully by us. I will in the interim undertake one of\n"+
		"Hercules' labours; which is, to bring Signior\n"+
		"Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain of\n"+
		"affection the one with the other. I would fain have\n"+
		"it a match, and I doubt not but to fashion it, if\n"+
		"you three will but minister such assistance as I\n"+
		"shall give you direction.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"My lord, I am for you, though it cost me ten\n"+
		"nights' watchings.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"And I, my lord.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"And you too, gentle Hero?\n"+
		"HERO\n"+
		"I will do any modest office, my lord, to help my\n"+
		"cousin to a good husband.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that\n"+
		"I know. Thus far can I praise him; he is of a noble\n"+
		"strain, of approved valour and confirmed honesty. I\n"+
		"will teach you how to humour your cousin, that she\n"+
		"shall fall in love with Benedick; and I, with your\n"+
		"two helps, will so practise on Benedick that, in\n"+
		"despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach, he\n"+
		"shall fall in love with Beatrice. If we can do this,\n"+
		"Cupid is no longer an archer: hi s glory shall be\n"+
		"ours, for we are the only love-gods. Go in with me,\n"+
		"and I will tell you my drift.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. The same.\n"+
		"Enter DON JOHN and BORACHIO\n"+
		"DON JOHN\n"+
		"It is so; the Count Claudio shall marry the\n"+
		"daughter of Leonato.\n"+
		"BORACHIO\n"+
		"Yea, my lord; but I can cross it.\n"+
		"DON JOHN\n"+
		"Any bar, any cross, any impediment will be\n"+
		"medicinable to me: I am sick in displeasure to him,\n"+
		"and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges\n"+
		"evenly with mine. How canst thou cross this marriage?\n"+
		"BORACHIO\n"+
		"Not honestly, my lord; but so covertly that no\n"+
		"dishonesty shall appear in me.\n"+
		"DON JOHN\n"+
		"Show me briefly how.\n"+
		"BORACHIO\n"+
		"I think I told your lordship a year since, how much\n"+
		"I am in the favour of Margaret, the waiting\n"+
		"gentlewoman to Hero.\n"+
		"DON JOHN\n"+
		"I remember.\n"+
		"BORACHIO\n"+
		"I can, at any unseasonable instant of the night,\n"+
		"appoint her to look out at her lady's chamber window.\n"+
		"DON JOHN\n"+
		"What life is in that, to be the death of this marriage?\n"+
		"BORACHIO\n"+
		"The poison of that lies in you to temper. Go you to\n"+
		"the prince your brother; spare not to tell him that\n"+
		"he hath wronged his honour in marrying the renowned\n"+
		"Claudio--whose estimation do you mightily hold\n"+
		"up--to a contaminated stale, such a one as Hero.\n"+
		"DON JOHN\n"+
		"What proof shall I make of that?\n"+
		"BORACHIO\n"+
		"Proof enough to misuse the prince, to vex Claudio,\n"+
		"to undo Hero and kill Leonato. Look you for any\n"+
		"other issue?\n"+
		"DON JOHN\n"+
		"Only to despite them, I will endeavour any thing.\n"+

		"honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's\n"+
		"reputation, who is thus like to be cozened with the\n"+
		"semblance of a maid,--that you have discovered\n"+

		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Boy!\n"+
		"Enter Boy\n"+
		"Boy\n"+
		"Signior?\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"In my chamber-window lies a book: bring it hither\n"+
		"to me in the orchard.\n"+
		"Boy\n"+
		"I am here already, sir.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"I know that; but I would have thee hence, and here again.\n"+
		"Exit Boy\n"+
		"I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much\n"+
		"another man is a fool when he dedicates his\n"+
		"behaviors to love, will, after he hath laughed at\n"+
		"such shallow follies in others, become the argument\n"+
		"of his own scorn by failing in love: and such a man\n"+
		"is Claudio. I have known when there was no music\n"+
		"with him but the drum and the fife; and now had he\n"+
		"rather hear the tabour and the pipe: I have known\n"+
		"when he would have walked ten mile a-foot to see a\n"+
		"good armour; and now will he lie ten nights awake,\n"+
		"carving the fashion of a new doublet. He was wont to\n"+
		"speak plain and to the purpose, like an honest man\n"+
		"and a soldier; and now is he turned orthography; his\n"+
		"words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many\n"+
		"strange dishes. May I be so converted and see with\n"+
		"these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not: I will not\n"+
		"be sworn, but love may transform me to an oyster; but\n"+
		"I'll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster\n"+
		"of me, he shall never make me such a fool. One woman\n"+
		"is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am\n"+
		"well; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all\n"+
		"graces be in one woman, one woman shall not come in\n"+
		"my grace. Rich she shall be, that's certain; wise,\n"+
		"or I'll none; virtuous, or I'll never cheapen her;\n"+
		"fair, or I'll never look on her; mild, or come not\n"+
		"near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good\n"+
		"discourse, an excellent musician, and her hair shall\n"+
		"be of what colour it please God. Ha! the prince and\n"+
		"Monsieur Love! I will hide me in the arbour.\n"+
		"Withdraws\n"+
		"Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, and LEONATO\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Come, shall we hear this music?\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Yea, my good lord. How still the evening is,\n"+
		"As hush'd on purpose to grace harmony!\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"See you where Benedick hath hid himself?\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"O, very well, my lord: the music ended,\n"+
		"We'll fit the kid-fox with a pennyworth.\n"+
		"Enter BALTHASAR with Music\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Come, Balthasar, we'll hear that song again.\n"+
		"BALTHASAR\n"+
		"O, good my lord, tax not so bad a voice\n"+
		"To slander music any more than once.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"It is the witness still of excellency\n"+
		"To put a strange face on his own perfection.\n"+
		"I pray thee, sing, and let me woo no more.\n"+
		"BALTHASAR\n"+
		"Because you talk of wooing, I will sing;\n"+
		"Since many a wooer doth commence his suit\n"+
		"To her he thinks not worthy, yet he wooes,\n"+
		"Yet will he swear he loves.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Now, pray thee, come;\n"+
		"Or, if thou wilt hold longer argument,\n"+
		"Do it in notes.\n"+
		"BALTHASAR\n"+
		"Note this before my notes;\n"+
		"There's not a note of mine that's worth the noting.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Why, these are very crotchets that he speaks;\n"+
		"Note, notes, forsooth, and nothing.\n"+
		"Air\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Now, divine air! now is his soul ravished! Is it\n"+
		"not strange that sheeps' guts should hale souls out\n"+
		"of men's bodies? Well, a horn for my money, when\n"+
		"all's done.\n"+
		"The Song\n"+
		"BALTHASAR\n"+
		"Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more,\n"+
		"Men were deceivers ever,\n"+
		"One foot in sea and one on shore,\n"+
		"To one thing constant never:\n"+
		"Then sigh not so, but let them go,\n"+
		"And be you blithe and bonny,\n"+
		"Converting all your sounds of woe\n"+
		"Into Hey nonny, nonny.\n"+
		"Sing no more ditties, sing no moe,\n"+
		"Of dumps so dull and heavy;\n"+
		"The fraud of men was ever so,\n"+
		"Since summer first was leafy:\n"+
		"Then sigh not so, & c.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"By my troth, a good song.\n"+
		"BALTHASAR\n"+
		"And an ill singer, my lord.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Ha, no, no, faith; thou singest well enough for a shift.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"An he had been a dog that should have howled thus,\n"+
		"they would have hanged him: and I pray God his bad\n"+
		"voice bode no mischief. I had as lief have heard the\n"+
		"night-raven, come what plague could have come after\n"+
		"it.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Yea, marry, dost thou hear, Balthasar? I pray thee,\n"+
		"get us some excellent music; for to-morrow night we\n"+
		"would have it at the Lady Hero's chamber-window.\n"+
		"BALTHASAR\n"+
		"The best I can, my lord.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Do so: farewell.\n"+
		"Exit BALTHASAR\n"+
		"Come hither, Leonato. What was it you told me of\n"+
		"to-day, that your niece Beatrice was in love with\n"+
		"Signior Benedick?\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"O, ay: stalk on. stalk on; the fowl sits. I did\n"+
		"never think that lady would have loved any man.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"No, nor I neither; but most wonderful that she\n"+
		"should so dote on Signior Benedick, whom she hath in\n"+
		"all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Is't possible? Sits the wind in that corner?\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"By my troth, my lord, I cannot tell what to think\n"+
		"of it but that she loves him with an enraged\n"+
		"affection: it is past the infinite of thought.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"May be she doth but counterfeit.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Faith, like enough.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"O God, counterfeit! There was never counterfeit of\n"+
		"passion came so near the life of passion as she\n"+
		"discovers it.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Why, what effects of passion shows she?\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Bait the hook well; this fish will bite.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"What effects, my lord? She will sit you, you heard\n"+
		"my daughter tell you how.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"She did, indeed.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"How, how, pray you? You amaze me: I would have I\n"+
		"thought her spirit had been invincible against all\n"+
		"assaults of affection.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"I would have sworn it had, my lord; especially\n"+
		"against Benedick.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"I should think this a gull, but that the\n"+
		"white-bearded fellow speaks it: knavery cannot,\n"+
		"sure, hide himself in such reverence.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"He hath ta'en the infection: hold it up.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Hath she made her affection known to Benedick?\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"No; and swears she never will: that's her torment.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"'Tis true, indeed; so your daughter says: 'Shall\n"+
		"I,' says she, 'that have so oft encountered him\n"+
		"with scorn, write to him that I love him?'\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"This says she now when she is beginning to write to\n"+
		"him; for she'll be up twenty times a night, and\n"+
		"there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a\n"+
		"sheet of paper: my daughter tells us all.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a\n"+
		"pretty jest your daughter told us of.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"O, when she had writ it and was reading it over, she\n"+
		"found Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet?\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"That.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"O, she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence;\n"+
		"railed at herself, that she should be so immodest\n"+
		"to write to one that she knew would flout her; 'I\n"+
		"measure him,' says she, 'by my own spirit; for I\n"+
		"should flout him, if he writ to me; yea, though I\n"+
		"love him, I should.'\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs,\n"+
		"beats her heart, tears her hair, prays, curses; 'O\n"+
		"sweet Benedick! God give me patience!'\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"She doth indeed; my daughter says so: and the\n"+
		"ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter\n"+
		"is sometime afeared she will do a desperate outrage\n"+
		"to herself: it is very true.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"It were good that Benedick knew of it by some\n"+
		"other, if she will not discover it.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"To what end? He would make but a sport of it and\n"+
		"torment the poor lady worse.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"An he should, it were an alms to hang him. She's an\n"+
		"excellent sweet lady; and, out of all suspicion,\n"+
		"she is virtuous.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"And she is exceeding wise.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"In every thing but in loving Benedick.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"O, my lord, wisdom and blood combating in so tender\n"+
		"a body, we have ten proofs to one that blood hath\n"+
		"the victory. I am sorry for her, as I have just\n"+
		"cause, being her uncle and her guardian.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"I would she had bestowed this dotage on me: I would\n"+
		"have daffed all other respects and made her half\n"+
		"myself. I pray you, tell Benedick of it, and hear\n"+
		"what a' will say.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Were it good, think you?\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Hero thinks surely she will die; for she says she\n"+
		"will die, if he love her not, and she will die, ere\n"+
		"she make her love known, and she will die, if he woo\n"+
		"her, rather than she will bate one breath of her\n"+
		"accustomed crossness.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"She doth well: if she should make tender of her\n"+
		"love, 'tis very possible he'll scorn it; for the\n"+
		"man, as you know all, hath a contemptible spirit.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"He is a very proper man.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"He hath indeed a good outward happiness.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Before God! and, in my mind, very wise.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"And I take him to be valiant.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"As Hector, I assure you: and in the managing of\n"+
		"quarrels you may say he is wise; for either he\n"+
		"avoids them with great discretion, or undertakes\n"+
		"them with a most Christian-like fear.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"If he do fear God, a' must necessarily keep peace:\n"+
		"if he break the peace, he ought to enter into a\n"+
		"quarrel with fear and trembling.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"And so will he do; for the man doth fear God,\n"+
		"howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests\n"+
		"he will make. Well I am sorry for your niece. Shall\n"+
		"we go seek Benedick, and tell him of her love?\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Never tell him, my lord: let her wear it out with\n"+
		"good counsel.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Nay, that's impossible: she may wear her heart out first.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter:\n"+
		"let it cool the while. I love Benedick well; and I\n"+
		"could wish he would modestly examine himself, to see\n"+
		"how much he is unworthy so good a lady.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"My lord, will you walk? dinner is ready.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"If he do not dote on her upon this, I will never\n"+
		"trust my expectation.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Let there be the same net spread for her; and that\n"+
		"must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry. The\n"+
		"sport will be, when they hold one an opinion of\n"+
		"another's dotage, and no such matter: that's the\n"+
		"scene that I would see, which will be merely a\n"+
		"dumb-show. Let us send her to call him in to dinner.\n"+
		"Exeunt DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, and LEONATO\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"[Coming forward] This can be no trick: the\n"+
		"conference was sadly borne. They have the truth of\n"+
		"this from Hero. They seem to pity the lady: it\n"+
		"seems her affections have their full bent. Love me!\n"+
		"why, it must be requited. I hear how I am censured:\n"+
		"they say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive\n"+
		"the love come from her; they say too that she will\n"+
		"rather die than give any sign of affection. I did\n"+
		"never think to marry: I must not seem proud: happy\n"+
		"are they that hear their detractions and can put\n"+
		"them to mending. They say the lady is fair; 'tis a\n"+
		"truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous; 'tis\n"+
		"so, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving\n"+
		"me; by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor\n"+
		"no great argument of her folly, for I will be\n"+
		"horribly in love with her. I may chance have some\n"+
		"odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me,\n"+
		"because I have railed so long against marriage: but\n"+
		"doth not the appetite alter? a man loves the meat\n"+
		"in his youth that he cannot endure in his age.\n"+
		"Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of\n"+
		"the brain awe a man from the career of his humour?\n"+
		"No, the world must be peopled. When I said I would\n"+
		"die a bachelor, I did not think I should live till I\n"+
		"were married. Here comes Beatrice. By this day!\n"+
		"she's a fair lady: I do spy some marks of love in\n"+
		"her.\n"+
		"Enter BEATRICE\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"I took no more pains for those thanks than you take\n"+
		"pains to thank me: if it had been painful, I would\n"+
		"not have come.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"You take pleasure then in the message?\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"Yea, just so much as you may take upon a knife's\n"+
		"point and choke a daw withal. You have no stomach,\n"+
		"signior: fare you well.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Ha! 'Against my will I am sent to bid you come in\n"+
		"to dinner;' there's a double meaning in that 'I took\n"+
		"no more pains for those thanks than you took pains\n"+
		"to thank me.' that's as much as to say, Any pains\n"+
		"that I take for you is as easy as thanks. If I do\n"+
		"not take pity of her, I am a villain; if I do not\n"+
		"love her, I am a Jew. I will go get her picture.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"ACT III\n"+
		"SCENE I. LEONATO'S garden.\n"+
		"Enter HERO, MARGARET, and URSULA\n"+
		"HERO\n"+
		"Good Margaret, run thee to the parlor;\n"+
		"There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice\n"+
		"Proposing with the prince and Claudio:\n"+
		"Whisper her ear and tell her, I and Ursula\n"+
		"Walk in the orchard and our whole discourse\n"+
		"Is all of her; say that thou overheard'st us;\n"+
		"And bid her steal into the pleached bower,\n"+
		"Where honeysuckles, ripen'd by the sun,\n"+
		"Forbid the sun to enter, like favourites,\n"+
		"Made proud by princes, that advance their pride\n"+
		"Against that power that bred it: there will she hide her,\n"+
		"To listen our purpose. This is thy office;\n"+
		"Bear thee well in it and leave us alone.\n"+
		"MARGARET\n"+
		"I'll make her come, I warrant you, presently.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"HERO\n"+
		"Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come,\n"+
		"As we do trace this alley up and down,\n"+
		"Our talk must only be of Benedick.\n"+
		"When I do name him, let it be thy part\n"+
		"To praise him more than ever man did merit:\n"+
		"My talk to thee must be how Benedick\n"+
		"Is sick in love with Beatrice. Of this matter\n"+
		"Is little Cupid's crafty arrow made,\n"+
		"That only wounds by hearsay.\n"+
		"Enter BEATRICE, behind\n"+
		"Now begin;\n"+
		"For look where Beatrice, like a lapwing, runs\n"+
		"Close by the ground, to hear our conference.\n"+
		"URSULA\n"+
		"The pleasant'st angling is to see the fish\n"+
		"Cut with her golden oars the silver stream,\n"+
		"And greedily devour the treacherous bait:\n"+
		"So angle we for Beatrice; who even now\n"+
		"Is couched in the woodbine coverture.\n"+
		"Fear you not my part of the dialogue.\n"+
		"HERO\n"+
		"Then go we near her, that her ear lose nothing\n"+
		"Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it.\n"+
		"Approaching the bower\n"+
		"No, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful;\n"+
		"I know her spirits are as coy and wild\n"+
		"As haggerds of the rock.\n"+
		"URSULA\n"+
		"But are you sure\n"+
		"That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?\n"+
		"HERO\n"+
		"So says the prince and my new-trothed lord.\n"+
		"URSULA\n"+
		"And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?\n"+
		"HERO\n"+
		"They did entreat me to acquaint her of it;\n"+
		"But I persuaded them, if they loved Benedick,\n"+
		"To wish him wrestle with affection,\n"+
		"And never to let Beatrice know of it.\n"+
		"URSULA\n"+
		"Why did you so? Doth not the gentleman\n"+
		"Deserve as full as fortunate a bed\n"+
		"As ever Beatrice shall couch upon?\n"+
		"HERO\n"+
		"O god of love! I know he doth deserve\n"+
		"As much as may be yielded to a man:\n"+
		"But Nature never framed a woman's heart\n"+
		"Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice;\n"+
		"Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,\n"+
		"Misprising what they look on, and her wit\n"+
		"Values itself so highly that to her\n"+
		"All matter else seems weak: she cannot love,\n"+
		"Nor take no shape nor project of affection,\n"+
		"She is so self-endeared.\n"+
		"URSULA\n"+
		"Sure, I think so;\n"+
		"And therefore certainly it were not good\n"+
		"She knew his love, lest she make sport at it.\n"+
		"HERO\n"+
		"Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,\n"+
		"How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featured,\n"+
		"But she would spell him backward: if fair-faced,\n"+
		"She would swear the gentleman should be her sister;\n"+
		"If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antique,\n"+
		"Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed;\n"+
		"If low, an agate very vilely cut;\n"+
		"If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;\n"+
		"If silent, why, a block moved with none.\n"+
		"So turns she every man the wrong side out\n"+
		"And never gives to truth and virtue that\n"+
		"Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.\n"+
		"URSULA\n"+
		"Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.\n"+
		"HERO\n"+
		"No, not to be so odd and from all fashions\n"+
		"As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable:\n"+
		"But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,\n"+
		"She would mock me into air; O, she would laugh me\n"+
		"Out of myself, press me to death with wit.\n"+
		"Therefore let Benedick, like cover'd fire,\n"+
		"Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly:\n"+
		"It were a better death than die with mocks,\n"+
		"Which is as bad as die with tickling.\n"+
		"URSULA\n"+
		"Yet tell her of it: hear what she will say.\n"+
		"HERO\n"+
		"No; rather I will go to Benedick\n"+
		"And counsel him to fight against his passion.\n"+
		"And, truly, I'll devise some honest slanders\n"+
		"To stain my cousin with: one doth not know\n"+
		"How much an ill word may empoison liking.\n"+
		"URSULA\n"+
		"O, do not do your cousin such a wrong.\n"+
		"She cannot be so much without true judgment--\n"+
		"Having so swift and excellent a wit\n"+
		"As she is prized to have--as to refuse\n"+
		"So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick.\n"+
		"HERO\n"+
		"He is the only man of Italy.\n"+
		"Always excepted my dear Claudio.\n"+
		"URSULA\n"+
		"I pray you, be not angry with me, madam,\n"+
		"Speaking my fancy: Signior Benedick,\n"+
		"For shape, for bearing, argument and valour,\n"+
		"Goes foremost in report through Italy.\n"+
		"HERO\n"+
		"Indeed, he hath an excellent good name.\n"+
		"URSULA\n"+
		"His excellence did earn it, ere he had it.\n"+
		"When are you married, madam?\n"+
		"HERO\n"+
		"Why, every day, to-morrow. Come, go in:\n"+
		"I'll show thee some attires, and have thy counsel\n"+
		"Which is the best to furnish me to-morrow.\n"+
		"URSULA\n"+
		"She's limed, I warrant you: we have caught her, madam.\n"+
		"HERO\n"+
		"If it proves so, then loving goes by haps:\n"+
		"Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps.\n"+
		"Exeunt HERO and URSULA\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"[Coming forward]\n"+
		"What fire is in mine ears? Can this be true?\n"+
		"Stand I condemn'd for pride and scorn so much?\n"+
		"Contempt, farewell! and maiden pride, adieu!\n"+
		"No glory lives behind the back of such.\n"+
		"And, Benedick, love on; I will requite thee,\n"+
		"Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand:\n"+
		"If thou dost love, my kindness shall incite thee\n"+
		"To bind our loves up in a holy band;\n"+
		"For others say thou dost deserve, and I\n"+
		"Believe it better than reportingly.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE II. A room in LEONATO'S house\n"+
		"Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, and LEONATO\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"I do but stay till your marriage be consummate, and\n"+

		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"I'll bring you thither, my lord, if you'll\n"+

		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new gloss\n"+
		"of your marriage as to show a child his new coat\n"+
		"and forbid him to wear it. I will only be bold\n"+
		"with Benedick for his company; for, from the crown\n"+
		"of his head to the sole of his foot, he is all\n"+
		"mirth: he hath twice or thrice cut Cupid's\n"+
		"bow-string and the little hangman dare not shoot at\n"+

		"So say I methinks you are sadder.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"I hope he be in love.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Hang him, truant! there's no true drop of blood in\n"+
		"him, to be truly touched with love: if he be sad,\n"+
		"he wants money.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"I have the toothache.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Draw it.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Hang it!\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"You must hang it first, and draw it afterwards.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"What! sigh for the toothache?\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Where is but a humour or a worm.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Well, every one can master a grief but he that has\n"+
		"it.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Yet say I, he is in love.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"There is no appearance of fancy in him, unless it be\n"+
		"a fancy that he hath to strange disguises; as, to be\n"+
		"a Dutchman today, a Frenchman to-morrow, or in the\n"+
		"shape of two countries at once, as, a German from\n"+
		"the waist downward, all slops, and a Spaniard from\n"+
		"the hip upward, no doublet. Unless he have a fancy\n"+
		"to this foolery, as it appears he hath, he is no\n"+
		"fool for fancy, as you would have it appear he is.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"If he be not in love with some woman, there is no\n"+
		"believing old signs: a' brushes his hat o'\n"+
		"mornings; what should that bode?\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Hath any man seen him at the barber's?\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"No, but the barber's man hath been seen with him,\n"+
		"and the old ornament of his cheek hath already\n"+
		"stuffed tennis-balls.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Indeed, he looks younger than he did, by the loss of a beard.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Nay, a' rubs himself with civet: can you smell him\n"+
		"out by that?\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"That's as much as to say, the sweet youth's in love.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"The greatest note of it is his melancholy.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"And when was he wont to wash his face?\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Yea, or to paint himself? for the which, I hear\n"+
		"what they say of him.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Nay, but his jesting spirit; which is now crept into\n"+
		"a lute-string and now governed by stops.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Indeed, that tells a heavy tale for him: conclude,\n"+
		"conclude he is in love.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Nay, but I know who loves him.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"That would I know too: I warrant, one that knows him not.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Yes, and his ill conditions; and, in despite of\n"+
		"all, dies for him.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"She shall be buried with her face upwards.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Yet is this no charm for the toothache. Old\n"+
		"signior, walk aside with me: I have studied eight\n"+
		"or nine wise words to speak to you, which these\n"+
		"hobby-horses must not hear.\n"+
		"Exeunt BENEDICK and LEONATO\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"For my life, to break with him about Beatrice.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"'Tis even so. Hero and Margaret have by this\n"+

		"DON JOHN\n"+
		"My lord and brother, God save you!\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+

		"DON JOHN\n"+
		"If your leisure served, I would speak with you.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"In private?\n"+
		"DON JOHN\n"+
		"If it please you: yet Count Claudio may hear; for\n"+
		"what I would speak of concerns him.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"What's the matter?\n"+
		"DON JOHN\n"+
		"[To CLAUDIO] Means your lordship to be married\n"+
		"to-morrow?\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"You know he does.\n"+
		"DON JOHN\n"+
		"I know not that, when he knows what I know.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"If there be any impediment, I pray you discover it.\n"+
		"DON JOHN\n"+
		"You may think I love you not: let that appear\n"+
		"hereafter, and aim better at me by that I now will\n"+
		"manifest. For my brother, I think he holds you\n"+
		"well, and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect\n"+
		"your ensuing marriage;--surely suit ill spent and\n"+
		"labour ill bestowed.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Why, what's the matter?\n"+
		"DON JOHN\n"+
		"I came hither to tell you; and, circumstances\n"+
		"shortened, for she has been too long a talking of,\n"+
		"the lady is disloyal.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Who, Hero?\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Even she; Leonato's Hero, your Hero, every man's Hero:\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Disloyal?\n"+
		"DON JOHN\n"+
		"The word is too good to paint out her wickedness; I\n"+
		"could say she were worse: think you of a worse\n"+
		"title, and I will fit her to it. Wonder not till\n"+
		"further warrant: go but with me to-night, you shall\n"+
		"see her chamber-window entered, even the night\n"+
		"before her wedding-day: if you love her then,\n"+
		"to-morrow wed her; but it would better fit your honour\n"+
		"to change your mind.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"May this be so?\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"I will not think it.\n"+
		"DON JOHN\n"+
		"If you dare not trust that you see, confess not\n"+
		"that you know: if you will follow me, I will show\n"+
		"you enough; and when you have seen more and heard\n"+
		"more, proceed accordingly.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"If I see any thing to-night why I should not marry\n"+
		"her to-morrow in the congregation, where I should\n"+
		"wed, there will I shame her.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"And, as I wooed for thee to obtain her, I will join\n"+
		"with thee to disgrace her.\n"+
		"DON JOHN\n"+
		"I will disparage her no farther till you are my\n"+
		"witnesses: bear it coldly but till midnight, and\n"+
		"let the issue show itself.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"O day untowardly turned!\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"O mischief strangely thwarting!\n"+
		"DON JOHN\n"+
		"O plague right well prevented! so will you say when\n"+
		"you have seen the sequel.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. A street.\n"+
		"Enter DOGBERRY and VERGES with the Watch\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"Are you good men and true?\n"+
		"VERGES\n"+
		"Yea, or else it were pity but they should suffer\n"+
		"salvation, body and soul.\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"Nay, that were a punishment too good for them, if\n"+
		"they should have any allegiance in them, being\n"+
		"chosen for the prince's watch.\n"+
		"VERGES\n"+
		"Well, give them their charge, neighbour Dogberry.\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"First, who think you the most desertless man to be\n"+
		"constable?\n"+
		"First Watchman\n"+
		"Hugh Otecake, sir, or George Seacole; for they can\n"+
		"write and read.\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"Come hither, neighbour Seacole. God hath blessed\n"+
		"you with a good name: to be a well-favoured man is\n"+
		"the gift of fortune; but to write and read comes by nature.\n"+
		"Second Watchman\n"+
		"Both which, master constable,--\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"You have: I knew it would be your answer. Well,\n"+
		"for your favour, sir, why, give God thanks, and make\n"+
		"no boast of it; and for your writing and reading,\n"+
		"let that appear when there is no need of such\n"+
		"vanity. You are thought here to be the most\n"+
		"senseless and fit man for the constable of the\n"+
		"watch; therefore bear you the lantern. This is your\n"+
		"charge: you shall comprehend all vagrom men; you are\n"+
		"to bid any man stand, in the prince's name.\n"+
		"Second Watchman\n"+
		"How if a' will not stand?\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go; and\n"+
		"presently call the rest of the watch together and\n"+
		"thank God you are rid of a knave.\n"+
		"VERGES\n"+
		"If he will not stand when he is bidden, he is none\n"+
		"of the prince's subjects.\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"True, and they are to meddle with none but the\n"+
		"prince's subjects. You shall also make no noise in\n"+
		"the streets; for, for the watch to babble and to\n"+
		"talk is most tolerable and not to be endured.\n"+
		"Watchman\n"+
		"We will rather sleep than talk: we know what\n"+
		"belongs to a watch.\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"Why, you speak like an ancient and most quiet\n"+
		"watchman; for I cannot see how sleeping should\n"+
		"offend: only, have a care that your bills be not\n"+
		"stolen. Well, you are to call at all the\n"+
		"ale-houses, and bid those that are drunk get them to bed.\n"+
		"Watchman\n"+
		"How if they will not?\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"Why, then, let them alone till they are sober: if\n"+
		"they make you not then the better answer, you may\n"+
		"say they are not the men you took them for.\n"+
		"Watchman\n"+
		"Well, sir.\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"If you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtue\n"+
		"of your office, to be no true man; and, for such\n"+
		"kind of men, the less you meddle or make with them,\n"+
		"why the more is for your honesty.\n"+
		"Watchman\n"+
		"If we know him to be a thief, shall we not lay\n"+
		"hands on him?\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"Truly, by your office, you may; but I think they\n"+
		"that touch pitch will be defiled: the most peaceable\n"+
		"way for you, if you do take a thief, is to let him\n"+
		"show himself what he is and steal out of your company.\n"+
		"VERGES\n"+
		"You have been always called a merciful man, partner.\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"Truly, I would not hang a dog by my will, much more\n"+
		"a man who hath any honesty in him.\n"+
		"VERGES\n"+
		"If you hear a child cry in the night, you must call\n"+
		"to the nurse and bid her still it.\n"+
		"Watchman\n"+
		"How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us?\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"Why, then, depart in peace, and let the child wake\n"+
		"her with crying; for the ewe that will not hear her\n"+
		"lamb when it baes will never answer a calf when he bleats.\n"+
		"VERGES\n"+
		"'Tis very true.\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"This is the end of the charge:--you, constable, are\n"+
		"to present the prince's own person: if you meet the\n"+
		"prince in the night, you may stay him.\n"+
		"VERGES\n"+
		"Nay, by'r our lady, that I think a' cannot.\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"Five shillings to one on't, with any man that knows\n"+
		"the statutes, he may stay him: marry, not without\n"+
		"the prince be willing; for, indeed, the watch ought\n"+
		"to offend no man; and it is an offence to stay a\n"+
		"man against his will.\n"+
		"VERGES\n"+
		"By'r lady, I think it be so.\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"Ha, ha, ha! Well, masters, good night: an there be\n"+
		"any matter of weight chances, call up me: keep your\n"+
		"fellows' counsels and your own; and good night.\n"+
		"Come, neighbour.\n"+
		"Watchman\n"+
		"Well, masters, we hear our charge: let us go sit here\n"+
		"upon the church-bench till two, and then all to bed.\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"One word more, honest neighbours. I pray you watch\n"+
		"about Signior Leonato's door; for the wedding being\n"+
		"there to-morrow, there is a great coil to-night.\n"+
		"Adieu: be vigitant, I beseech you.\n"+
		"Exeunt DOGBERRY and VERGES\n"+
		"Enter BORACHIO and CONRADE\n"+
		"BORACHIO\n"+
		"What Conrade!\n"+
		"Watchman\n"+
		"[Aside] Peace! stir not.\n"+
		"BORACHIO\n"+
		"Conrade, I say!\n"+
		"CONRADE\n"+
		"Here, man; I am at thy elbow.\n"+
		"BORACHIO\n"+
		"Mass, and my elbow itched; I thought there would a\n"+
		"scab follow.\n"+
		"CONRADE\n"+
		"I will owe thee an answer for that: and now forward\n"+
		"with thy tale.\n"+
		"BORACHIO\n"+
		"Stand thee close, then, under this pent-house, for\n"+
		"it drizzles rain; and I will, like a true drunkard,\n"+
		"utter all to thee.\n"+
		"Watchman\n"+
		"[Aside] Some treason, masters: yet stand close.\n"+
		"BORACHIO\n"+
		"Therefore know I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats.\n"+
		"CONRADE\n"+
		"Is it possible that any villany should be so dear?\n"+
		"BORACHIO\n"+
		"Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any\n"+
		"villany should be so rich; for when rich villains\n"+
		"have need of poor ones, poor ones may make what\n"+
		"price they will.\n"+
		"CONRADE\n"+
		"I wonder at it.\n"+
		"BORACHIO\n"+
		"That shows thou art unconfirmed. Thou knowest that\n"+
		"the fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloak, is\n"+
		"nothing to a man.\n"+
		"CONRADE\n"+
		"Yes, it is apparel.\n"+
		"BORACHIO\n"+
		"I mean, the fashion.\n"+
		"CONRADE\n"+
		"Yes, the fashion is the fashion.\n"+
		"BORACHIO\n"+
		"Tush! I may as well say the fool's the fool. But\n"+
		"seest thou not what a deformed thief this fashion\n"+
		"is?\n"+
		"Watchman\n"+
		"[Aside] I know that Deformed; a' has been a vile\n"+
		"thief this seven year; a' goes up and down like a\n"+
		"gentleman: I remember his name.\n"+
		"BORACHIO\n"+
		"Didst thou not hear somebody?\n"+
		"CONRADE\n"+
		"No; 'twas the vane on the house.\n"+
		"BORACHIO\n"+
		"Seest thou not, I say, what a deformed thief this\n"+
		"fashion is? how giddily a' turns about all the hot\n"+
		"bloods between fourteen and five-and-thirty?\n"+
		"sometimes fashioning them like Pharaoh's soldiers\n"+
		"in the reeky painting, sometime like god Bel's\n"+
		"priests in the old church-window, sometime like the\n"+
		"shaven Hercules in the smirched worm-eaten tapestry,\n"+
		"where his codpiece seems as massy as his club?\n"+
		"CONRADE\n"+
		"All this I see; and I see that the fashion wears\n"+
		"out more apparel than the man. But art not thou\n"+
		"thyself giddy with the fashion too, that thou hast\n"+
		"shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion?\n"+
		"BORACHIO\n"+
		"Not so, neither: but know that I have to-night\n"+
		"wooed Margaret, the Lady Hero's gentlewoman, by the\n"+
		"name of Hero: she leans me out at her mistress'\n"+
		"chamber-window, bids me a thousand times good\n"+
		"night,--I tell this tale vilely:--I should first\n"+
		"tell thee how the prince, Claudio and my master,\n"+
		"planted and placed and possessed by my master Don\n"+
		"John, saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter.\n"+
		"CONRADE\n"+
		"And thought they Margaret was Hero?\n"+
		"BORACHIO\n"+
		"Two of them did, the prince and Claudio; but the\n"+
		"devil my master knew she was Margaret; and partly\n"+
		"by his oaths, which first possessed them, partly by\n"+
		"the dark night, which did deceive them, but chiefly\n"+
		"by my villany, which did confirm any slander that\n"+
		"Don John had made, away went Claudio enraged; swore\n"+
		"he would meet her, as he was appointed, next morning\n"+
		"at the temple, and there, before the whole\n"+
		"congregation, shame her with what he saw o'er night\n"+
		"and send her home again without a husband.\n"+
		"First Watchman\n"+
		"We charge you, in the prince's name, stand!\n"+
		"Second Watchman\n"+
		"Call up the right master constable. We have here\n"+
		"recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that\n"+
		"ever was known in the commonwealth.\n"+
		"First Watchman\n"+
		"And one Deformed is one of them: I know him; a'\n"+
		"wears a lock.\n"+
		"CONRADE\n"+
		"Masters, masters,--\n"+
		"Second Watchman\n"+
		"You'll be made bring Deformed forth, I warrant you.\n"+
		"CONRADE\n"+
		"Masters,--\n"+
		"First Watchman\n"+
		"Never speak: we charge you let us obey you to go with us.\n"+
		"BORACHIO\n"+
		"We are like to prove a goodly commodity, being taken\n"+
		"up of these men's bills.\n"+
		"CONRADE\n"+
		"A commodity in question, I warrant you. Come, we'll obey you.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV. HERO's apartment.\n"+
		"Enter HERO, MARGARET, and URSULA\n"+
		"HERO\n"+
		"Good Ursula, wake my cousin Beatrice, and desire\n"+
		"her to rise.\n"+
		"URSULA\n"+
		"I will, lady.\n"+
		"HERO\n"+
		"And bid her come hither.\n"+
		"URSULA\n"+
		"Well.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"MARGARET\n"+
		"Troth, I think your other rabato were better.\n"+
		"HERO\n"+
		"No, pray thee, good Meg, I'll wear this.\n"+
		"MARGARET\n"+
		"By my troth, 's not so good; and I warrant your\n"+
		"cousin will say so.\n"+
		"HERO\n"+
		"My cousin's a fool, and thou art another: I'll wear\n"+
		"none but this.\n"+
		"MARGARET\n"+
		"I like the new tire within excellently, if the hair\n"+
		"were a thought browner; and your gown's a most rare\n"+
		"fashion, i' faith. I saw the Duchess of Milan's\n"+
		"gown that they praise so.\n"+
		"HERO\n"+
		"O, that exceeds, they say.\n"+
		"MARGARET\n"+
		"By my troth, 's but a night-gown in respect of\n"+
		"yours: cloth o' gold, and cuts, and laced with\n"+
		"silver, set with pearls, down sleeves, side sleeves,\n"+
		"and skirts, round underborne with a bluish tinsel:\n"+
		"but for a fine, quaint, graceful and excellent\n"+
		"fashion, yours is worth ten on 't.\n"+
		"HERO\n"+
		"God give me joy to wear it! for my heart is\n"+
		"exceeding heavy.\n"+
		"MARGARET\n"+
		"'Twill be heavier soon by the weight of a man.\n"+
		"HERO\n"+
		"Fie upon thee! art not ashamed?\n"+
		"MARGARET\n"+
		"Of what, lady? of speaking honourably? Is not\n"+
		"marriage honourable in a beggar? Is not your lord\n"+
		"honourable without marriage? I think you would have\n"+
		"me say, 'saving your reverence, a husband:' and bad\n"+
		"thinking do not wrest true speaking, I'll offend\n"+
		"nobody: is there any harm in 'the heavier for a\n"+
		"husband'? None, I think, and it be the right husband\n"+
		"and the right wife; otherwise 'tis light, and not\n"+
		"heavy: ask my Lady Beatrice else; here she comes.\n"+
		"Enter BEATRICE\n"+
		"HERO\n"+
		"Good morrow, coz.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"Good morrow, sweet Hero.\n"+
		"HERO\n"+
		"Why how now? do you speak in the sick tune?\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"I am out of all other tune, methinks.\n"+
		"MARGARET\n"+
		"Clap's into 'Light o' love;' that goes without a\n"+
		"burden: do you sing it, and I'll dance it.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"Ye light o' love, with your heels! then, if your\n"+
		"husband have stables enough, you'll see he shall\n"+
		"lack no barns.\n"+
		"MARGARET\n"+
		"O illegitimate construction! I scorn that with my heels.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"'Tis almost five o'clock, cousin; tis time you were\n"+
		"ready. By my troth, I am exceeding ill: heigh-ho!\n"+
		"MARGARET\n"+
		"For a hawk, a horse, or a husband?\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"For the letter that begins them all, H.\n"+
		"MARGARET\n"+
		"Well, and you be not turned Turk, there's no more\n"+
		"sailing by the star.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"What means the fool, trow?\n"+
		"MARGARET\n"+
		"Nothing I; but God send every one their heart's desire!\n"+
		"HERO\n"+
		"These gloves the count sent me; they are an\n"+
		"excellent perfume.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"I am stuffed, cousin; I cannot smell.\n"+
		"MARGARET\n"+
		"A maid, and stuffed! there's goodly catching of cold.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"O, God help me! God help me! how long have you\n"+
		"professed apprehension?\n"+
		"MARGARET\n"+
		"Even since you left it. Doth not my wit become me rarely?\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"It is not seen enough, you should wear it in your\n"+
		"cap. By my troth, I am sick.\n"+
		"MARGARET\n"+
		"Get you some of this distilled Carduus Benedictus,\n"+
		"and lay it to your heart: it is the only thing for a qualm.\n"+
		"HERO\n"+
		"There thou prickest her with a thistle.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"Benedictus! why Benedictus? you have some moral in\n"+
		"this Benedictus.\n"+
		"MARGARET\n"+
		"Moral! no, by my troth, I have no moral meaning; I\n"+
		"meant, plain holy-thistle. You may think perchance\n"+
		"that I think you are in love: nay, by'r lady, I am\n"+
		"not such a fool to think what I list, nor I list\n"+
		"not to think what I can, nor indeed I cannot think,\n"+
		"if I would think my heart out of thinking, that you\n"+
		"are in love or that you will be in love or that you\n"+
		"can be in love. Yet Benedick was such another, and\n"+
		"now is he become a man: he swore he would never\n"+
		"marry, and yet now, in despite of his heart, he eats\n"+
		"his meat without grudging: and how you may be\n"+
		"converted I know not, but methinks you look with\n"+
		"your eyes as other women do.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"What pace is this that thy tongue keeps?\n"+
		"MARGARET\n"+
		"Not a false gallop.\n"+
		"Re-enter URSULA\n"+
		"URSULA\n"+
		"Madam, withdraw: the prince, the count, Signior\n"+
		"Benedick, Don John, and all the gallants of the\n"+

		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE V. Another room in LEONATO'S house.\n"+
		"Enter LEONATO, with DOGBERRY and VERGES\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"What would you with me, honest neighbour?\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"Marry, sir, I would have some confidence with you\n"+
		"that decerns you nearly.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Brief, I pray you; for you see it is a busy time with me.\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"Marry, this it is, sir.\n"+
		"VERGES\n"+
		"Yes, in truth it is, sir.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"What is it, my good friends?\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"Goodman Verges, sir, speaks a little off the\n"+
		"matter: an old man, sir, and his wits are not so\n"+
		"blunt as, God help, I would desire they were; but,\n"+
		"in faith, honest as the skin between his brows.\n"+
		"VERGES\n"+
		"Yes, I thank God I am as honest as any man living\n"+
		"that is an old man and no honester than I.\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"Comparisons are odorous: palabras, neighbour Verges.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Neighbours, you are tedious.\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"It pleases your worship to say so, but we are the\n"+
		"poor duke's officers; but truly, for mine own part,\n"+
		"if I were as tedious as a king, I could find it in\n"+
		"my heart to bestow it all of your worship.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"All thy tediousness on me, ah?\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"Yea, an 'twere a thousand pound more than 'tis; for\n"+
		"I hear as good exclamation on your worship as of any\n"+
		"man in the city; and though I be but a poor man, I\n"+
		"am glad to hear it.\n"+
		"VERGES\n"+
		"And so am I.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"I would fain know what you have to say.\n"+
		"VERGES\n"+
		"Marry, sir, our watch to-night, excepting your\n"+
		"worship's presence, ha' ta'en a couple of as arrant\n"+
		"knaves as any in Messina.\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"A good old man, sir; he will be talking: as they\n"+
		"say, when the age is in, the wit is out: God help\n"+
		"us! it is a world to see. Well said, i' faith,\n"+
		"neighbour Verges: well, God's a good man; an two men\n"+
		"ride of a horse, one must ride behind. An honest\n"+
		"soul, i' faith, sir; by my troth he is, as ever\n"+
		"broke bread; but God is to be worshipped; all men\n"+
		"are not alike; alas, good neighbour!\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Indeed, neighbour, he comes too short of you.\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"Gifts that God gives.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"I must leave you.\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"One word, sir: our watch, sir, have indeed\n"+
		"comprehended two aspicious persons, and we would\n"+
		"have them this morning examined before your worship.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Take their examination yourself and bring it me: I\n"+
		"am now in great haste, as it may appear unto you.\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"It shall be suffigance.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Drink some wine ere you go: fare you well.\n"+
		"Enter a Messenger\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"My lord, they stay for you to give your daughter to\n"+
		"her husband.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"I'll wait upon them: I am ready.\n"+
		"Exeunt LEONATO and Messenger\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"Go, good partner, go, get you to Francis Seacole;\n"+
		"bid him bring his pen and inkhorn to the gaol: we\n"+
		"are now to examination these men.\n"+
		"VERGES\n"+
		"And we must do it wisely.\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"We will spare for no wit, I warrant you; here's\n"+
		"that shall drive some of them to a non-come: only\n"+
		"get the learned writer to set down our\n"+
		"excommunication and meet me at the gaol.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT IV\n"+
		"SCENE I. A church.\n"+
		"Enter DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, LEONATO, FRIAR FRANCIS, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, HERO, BEATRICE, and Attendants\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Come, Friar Francis, be brief; only to the plain\n"+
		"form of marriage, and you shall recount their\n"+
		"particular duties afterwards.\n"+
		"FRIAR FRANCIS\n"+
		"You come hither, my lord, to marry this lady.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"No.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"To be married to her: friar, you come to marry her.\n"+
		"FRIAR FRANCIS\n"+
		"Lady, you come hither to be married to this count.\n"+
		"HERO\n"+
		"I do.\n"+
		"FRIAR FRANCIS\n"+
		"If either of you know any inward impediment why you\n"+
		"should not be conjoined, charge you, on your souls,\n"+
		"to utter it.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Know you any, Hero?\n"+
		"HERO\n"+
		"None, my lord.\n"+
		"FRIAR FRANCIS\n"+
		"Know you any, count?\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"I dare make his answer, none.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"O, what men dare do! what men may do! what men daily\n"+
		"do, not knowing what they do!\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"How now! interjections? Why, then, some be of\n"+
		"laughing, as, ah, ha, he!\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Stand thee by, friar. Father, by your leave:\n"+
		"Will you with free and unconstrained soul\n"+
		"Give me this maid, your daughter?\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"As freely, son, as God did give her me.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"And what have I to give you back, whose worth\n"+
		"May counterpoise this rich and precious gift?\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Nothing, unless you render her again.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Sweet prince, you learn me noble thankfulness.\n"+
		"There, Leonato, take her back again:\n"+
		"Give not this rotten orange to your friend;\n"+
		"She's but the sign and semblance of her honour.\n"+
		"Behold how like a maid she blushes here!\n"+
		"O, what authority and show of truth\n"+
		"Can cunning sin cover itself withal!\n"+
		"Comes not that blood as modest evidence\n"+
		"To witness simple virtue? Would you not swear,\n"+
		"All you that see her, that she were a maid,\n"+
		"By these exterior shows? But she is none:\n"+
		"She knows the heat of a luxurious bed;\n"+
		"Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"What do you mean, my lord?\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Not to be married,\n"+
		"Not to knit my soul to an approved wanton.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Dear my lord, if you, in your own proof,\n"+
		"Have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth,\n"+
		"And made defeat of her virginity,--\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"I know what you would say: if I have known her,\n"+
		"You will say she did embrace me as a husband,\n"+
		"And so extenuate the 'forehand sin:\n"+
		"No, Leonato,\n"+
		"I never tempted her with word too large;\n"+
		"But, as a brother to his sister, show'd\n"+
		"Bashful sincerity and comely love.\n"+
		"HERO\n"+
		"And seem'd I ever otherwise to you?\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Out on thee! Seeming! I will write against it:\n"+
		"You seem to me as Dian in her orb,\n"+
		"As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown;\n"+
		"But you are more intemperate in your blood\n"+
		"Than Venus, or those pamper'd animals\n"+
		"That rage in savage sensuality.\n"+
		"HERO\n"+
		"Is my lord well, that he doth speak so wide?\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Sweet prince, why speak not you?\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"What should I speak?\n"+
		"I stand dishonour'd, that have gone about\n"+
		"To link my dear friend to a common stale.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Are these things spoken, or do I but dream?\n"+
		"DON JOHN\n"+
		"Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"This looks not like a nuptial.\n"+
		"HERO\n"+
		"True! O God!\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Leonato, stand I here?\n"+
		"Is this the prince? is this the prince's brother?\n"+
		"Is this face Hero's? are our eyes our own?\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"All this is so: but what of this, my lord?\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Let me but move one question to your daughter;\n"+
		"And, by that fatherly and kindly power\n"+
		"That you have in her, bid her answer truly.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"I charge thee do so, as thou art my child.\n"+
		"HERO\n"+
		"O, God defend me! how am I beset!\n"+
		"What kind of catechising call you this?\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"To make you answer truly to your name.\n"+
		"HERO\n"+
		"Is it not Hero? Who can blot that name\n"+
		"With any just reproach?\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Marry, that can Hero;\n"+
		"Hero itself can blot out Hero's virtue.\n"+
		"What man was he talk'd with you yesternight\n"+
		"Out at your window betwixt twelve and one?\n"+
		"Now, if you are a maid, answer to this.\n"+
		"HERO\n"+
		"I talk'd with no man at that hour, my lord.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Why, then are you no maiden. Leonato,\n"+
		"I am sorry you must hear: upon mine honour,\n"+
		"Myself, my brother and this grieved count\n"+
		"Did see her, hear her, at that hour last night\n"+
		"Talk with a ruffian at her chamber-window\n"+
		"Who hath indeed, most like a liberal villain,\n"+
		"Confess'd the vile encounters they have had\n"+
		"A thousand times in secret.\n"+
		"DON JOHN\n"+
		"Fie, fie! they are not to be named, my lord,\n"+
		"Not to be spoke of;\n"+
		"There is not chastity enough in language\n"+
		"Without offence to utter them. Thus, pretty lady,\n"+
		"I am sorry for thy much misgovernment.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"O Hero, what a Hero hadst thou been,\n"+
		"If half thy outward graces had been placed\n"+
		"About thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart!\n"+
		"But fare thee well, most foul, most fair! farewell,\n"+
		"Thou pure impiety and impious purity!\n"+
		"For thee I'll lock up all the gates of love,\n"+
		"And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang,\n"+
		"To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm,\n"+
		"And never shall it more be gracious.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Hath no man's dagger here a point for me?\n"+
		"HERO swoons\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"Why, how now, cousin! wherefore sink you down?\n"+
		"DON JOHN\n"+
		"Come, let us go. These things, come thus to light,\n"+
		"Smother her spirits up.\n"+
		"Exeunt DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, and CLAUDIO\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"How doth the lady?\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"Dead, I think. Help, uncle!\n"+
		"Hero! why, Hero! Uncle! Signior Benedick! Friar!\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"O Fate! take not away thy heavy hand.\n"+
		"Death is the fairest cover for her shame\n"+
		"That may be wish'd for.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"How now, cousin Hero!\n"+
		"FRIAR FRANCIS\n"+
		"Have comfort, lady.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Dost thou look up?\n"+
		"FRIAR FRANCIS\n"+
		"Yea, wherefore should she not?\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Wherefore! Why, doth not every earthly thing\n"+
		"Cry shame upon her? Could she here deny\n"+
		"The story that is printed in her blood?\n"+
		"Do not live, Hero; do not ope thine eyes:\n"+
		"For, did I think thou wouldst not quickly die,\n"+
		"Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames,\n"+
		"Myself would, on the rearward of reproaches,\n"+
		"Strike at thy life. Grieved I, I had but one?\n"+
		"Chid I for that at frugal nature's frame?\n"+
		"O, one too much by thee! Why had I one?\n"+
		"Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes?\n"+
		"Why had I not with charitable hand\n"+
		"Took up a beggar's issue at my gates,\n"+
		"Who smirch'd thus and mired with infamy,\n"+
		"I might have said 'No part of it is mine;\n"+
		"This shame derives itself from unknown loins'?\n"+
		"But mine and mine I loved and mine I praised\n"+
		"And mine that I was proud on, mine so much\n"+
		"That I myself was to myself not mine,\n"+
		"Valuing of her,--why, she, O, she is fallen\n"+
		"Into a pit of ink, that the wide sea\n"+
		"Hath drops too few to wash her clean again\n"+
		"And salt too little which may season give\n"+
		"To her foul-tainted flesh!\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Sir, sir, be patient.\n"+
		"For my part, I am so attired in wonder,\n"+
		"I know not what to say.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"O, on my soul, my cousin is belied!\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Lady, were you her bedfellow last night?\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"No, truly not; although, until last night,\n"+
		"I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Confirm'd, confirm'd! O, that is stronger made\n"+
		"Which was before barr'd up with ribs of iron!\n"+
		"Would the two princes lie, and Claudio lie,\n"+
		"Who loved her so, that, speaking of her foulness,\n"+
		"Wash'd it with tears? Hence from her! let her die.\n"+
		"FRIAR FRANCIS\n"+
		"Hear me a little;\n"+
		"For I have only been silent so long\n"+
		"And given way unto this course of fortune.\n"+
		"...\n"+
		"By noting of the lady I have mark'd\n"+
		"A thousand blushing apparitions\n"+
		"To start into her face, a thousand innocent shames\n"+
		"In angel whiteness beat away those blushes;\n"+
		"And in her eye there hath appear'd a fire,\n"+
		"To burn the errors that these princes hold\n"+
		"Against her maiden truth. Call me a fool;\n"+
		"Trust not my reading nor my observations,\n"+
		"Which with experimental seal doth warrant\n"+
		"The tenor of my book; trust not my age,\n"+
		"My reverence, calling, nor divinity,\n"+
		"If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here\n"+
		"Under some biting error.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Friar, it cannot be.\n"+
		"Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left\n"+
		"Is that she will not add to her damnation\n"+
		"A sin of perjury; she not denies it:\n"+
		"Why seek'st thou then to cover with excuse\n"+
		"That which appears in proper nakedness?\n"+
		"FRIAR FRANCIS\n"+
		"Lady, what man is he you are accused of?\n"+
		"HERO\n"+
		"They know that do accuse me; I know none:\n"+
		"If I know more of any man alive\n"+
		"Than that which maiden modesty doth warrant,\n"+
		"Let all my sins lack mercy! O my father,\n"+
		"Prove you that any man with me conversed\n"+
		"At hours unmeet, or that I yesternight\n"+
		"Maintain'd the change of words with any creature,\n"+
		"Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death!\n"+
		"FRIAR FRANCIS\n"+
		"There is some strange misprision in the princes.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Two of them have the very bent of honour;\n"+
		"And if their wisdoms be misled in this,\n"+
		"The practise of it lives in John the bastard,\n"+
		"Whose spirits toil in frame of villanies.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"I know not. If they speak but truth of her,\n"+
		"These hands shall tear her; if they wrong her honour,\n"+
		"The proudest of them shall well hear of it.\n"+
		"Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine,\n"+
		"Nor age so eat up my invention,\n"+
		"Nor fortune made such havoc of my means,\n"+
		"Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,\n"+
		"But they shall find, awaked in such a kind,\n"+
		"Both strength of limb and policy of mind,\n"+
		"Ability in means and choice of friends,\n"+
		"To quit me of them throughly.\n"+
		"FRIAR FRANCIS\n"+
		"Pause awhile,\n"+
		"And let my counsel sway you in this case.\n"+
		"Your daughter here the princes left for dead:\n"+
		"Let her awhile be secretly kept in,\n"+
		"And publish it that she is dead indeed;\n"+
		"Maintain a mourning ostentation\n"+
		"And on your family's old monument\n"+
		"Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites\n"+
		"That appertain unto a burial.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"What shall become of this? what will this do?\n"+
		"FRIAR FRANCIS\n"+
		"Marry, this well carried shall on her behalf\n"+
		"Change slander to remorse; that is some good:\n"+
		"But not for that dream I on this strange course,\n"+
		"But on this travail look for greater birth.\n"+
		"She dying, as it must so be maintain'd,\n"+
		"Upon the instant that she was accused,\n"+
		"Shall be lamented, pitied and excused\n"+
		"Of every hearer: for it so falls out\n"+
		"That what we have we prize not to the worth\n"+
		"Whiles we enjoy it, but being lack'd and lost,\n"+
		"Why, then we rack the value, then we find\n"+
		"The virtue that possession would not show us\n"+
		"Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio:\n"+
		"When he shall hear she died upon his words,\n"+
		"The idea of her life shall sweetly creep\n"+
		"Into his study of imagination,\n"+
		"And every lovely organ of her life\n"+
		"Shall come apparell'd in more precious habit,\n"+
		"More moving-delicate and full of life,\n"+
		"Into the eye and prospect of his soul,\n"+
		"Than when she lived indeed; then shall he mourn,\n"+
		"If ever love had interest in his liver,\n"+
		"And wish he had not so accused her,\n"+
		"No, though he thought his accusation true.\n"+
		"Let this be so, and doubt not but success\n"+
		"Will fashion the event in better shape\n"+
		"Than I can lay it down in likelihood.\n"+
		"But if all aim but this be levell'd false,\n"+
		"The supposition of the lady's death\n"+
		"Will quench the wonder of her infamy:\n"+
		"And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,\n"+
		"As best befits her wounded reputation,\n"+
		"In some reclusive and religious life,\n"+
		"Out of all eyes, tongues, minds and injuries.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Signior Leonato, let the friar advise you:\n"+
		"And though you know my inwardness and love\n"+
		"Is very much unto the prince and Claudio,\n"+
		"Yet, by mine honour, I will deal in this\n"+
		"As secretly and justly as your soul\n"+
		"Should with your body.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Being that I flow in grief,\n"+
		"The smallest twine may lead me.\n"+
		"FRIAR FRANCIS\n"+
		"'Tis well consented: presently away;\n"+
		"For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure.\n"+
		"Come, lady, die to live: this wedding-day\n"+
		"Perhaps is but prolong'd: have patience and endure.\n"+
		"Exeunt all but BENEDICK and BEATRICE\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Lady Beatrice, have you wept all this while?\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"Yea, and I will weep a while longer.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"I will not desire that.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"You have no reason; I do it freely.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Surely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"Ah, how much might the man deserve of me that would right her!\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Is there any way to show such friendship?\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"A very even way, but no such friend.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"May a man do it?\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"It is a man's office, but not yours.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"I do love nothing in the world so well as you: is\n"+
		"not that strange?\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"As strange as the thing I know not. It were as\n"+
		"possible for me to say I loved nothing so well as\n"+
		"you: but believe me not; and yet I lie not; I\n"+
		"confess nothing, nor I deny nothing. I am sorry for my cousin.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"By my sword, Beatrice, thou lovest me.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"Do not swear, and eat it.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"I will swear by it that you love me; and I will make\n"+
		"him eat it that says I love not you.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"Will you not eat your word?\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"With no sauce that can be devised to it. I protest\n"+
		"I love thee.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"Why, then, God forgive me!\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"What offence, sweet Beatrice?\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"You have stayed me in a happy hour: I was about to\n"+
		"protest I loved you.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"And do it with all thy heart.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"I love you with so much of my heart that none is\n"+
		"left to protest.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Come, bid me do any thing for thee.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"Kill Claudio.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Ha! not for the wide world.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"You kill me to deny it. Farewell.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Tarry, sweet Beatrice.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"I am gone, though I am here: there is no love in\n"+
		"you: nay, I pray you, let me go.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Beatrice,--\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"In faith, I will go.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"We'll be friends first.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"You dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Is Claudio thine enemy?\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"Is he not approved in the height a villain, that\n"+
		"hath slandered, scorned, dishonoured my kinswoman? O\n"+
		"that I were a man! What, bear her in hand until they\n"+
		"come to take hands; and then, with public\n"+
		"accusation, uncovered slander, unmitigated rancour,\n"+
		"--O God, that I were a man! I would eat his heart\n"+
		"in the market-place.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Hear me, Beatrice,--\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"Talk with a man out at a window! A proper saying!\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Nay, but, Beatrice,--\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"Sweet Hero! She is wronged, she is slandered, she is undone.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Beat--\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"Princes and counties! Surely, a princely testimony,\n"+
		"a goodly count, Count Comfect; a sweet gallant,\n"+
		"surely! O that I were a man for his sake! or that I\n"+
		"had any friend would be a man for my sake! But\n"+
		"manhood is melted into courtesies, valour into\n"+
		"compliment, and men are only turned into tongue, and\n"+
		"trim ones too: he is now as valiant as Hercules\n"+
		"that only tells a lie and swears it. I cannot be a\n"+
		"man with wishing, therefore I will die a woman with grieving.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Tarry, good Beatrice. By this hand, I love thee.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"Use it for my love some other way than swearing by it.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Think you in your soul the Count Claudio hath wronged Hero?\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"Yea, as sure as I have a thought or a soul.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Enough, I am engaged; I will challenge him. I will\n"+
		"kiss your hand, and so I leave you. By this hand,\n"+
		"Claudio shall render me a dear account. As you\n"+
		"hear of me, so think of me. Go, comfort your\n"+
		"cousin: I must say she is dead: and so, farewell.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. A prison.\n"+
		"Enter DOGBERRY, VERGES, and Sexton, in gowns; and the Watch, with CONRADE and BORACHIO\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"Is our whole dissembly appeared?\n"+
		"VERGES\n"+
		"O, a stool and a cushion for the sexton.\n"+
		"Sexton\n"+
		"Which be the malefactors?\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"Marry, that am I and my partner.\n"+
		"VERGES\n"+
		"Nay, that's certain; we have the exhibition to examine.\n"+
		"Sexton\n"+
		"But which are the offenders that are to be\n"+
		"examined? let them come before master constable.\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"Yea, marry, let them come before me. What is your\n"+
		"name, friend?\n"+
		"BORACHIO\n"+
		"Borachio.\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"Pray, write down, Borachio. Yours, sirrah?\n"+
		"CONRADE\n"+
		"I am a gentleman, sir, and my name is Conrade.\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"Write down, master gentleman Conrade. Masters, do\n"+
		"you serve God?\n"+
		"CONRADE\n"+
		"BORACHIO\n"+
		"Yea, sir, we hope.\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"Write down, that they hope they serve God: and\n"+
		"write God first; for God defend but God should go\n"+
		"before such villains! Masters, it is proved already\n"+
		"that you are little better than false knaves; and it\n"+
		"will go near to be thought so shortly. How answer\n"+
		"you for yourselves?\n"+
		"CONRADE\n"+
		"Marry, sir, we say we are none.\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"A marvellous witty fellow, I assure you: but I\n"+
		"will go about with him. Come you hither, sirrah; a\n"+
		"word in your ear: sir, I say to you, it is thought\n"+
		"you are false knaves.\n"+
		"BORACHIO\n"+
		"Sir, I say to you we are none.\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"Well, stand aside. 'Fore God, they are both in a\n"+
		"tale. Have you writ down, that they are none?\n"+
		"Sexton\n"+
		"Master constable, you go not the way to examine:\n"+
		"you must call forth the watch that are their accusers.\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"Yea, marry, that's the eftest way. Let the watch\n"+
		"come forth. Masters, I charge you, in the prince's\n"+
		"name, accuse these men.\n"+
		"First Watchman\n"+
		"This man said, sir, that Don John, the prince's\n"+
		"brother, was a villain.\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"Write down Prince John a villain. Why, this is flat\n"+
		"perjury, to call a prince's brother villain.\n"+
		"BORACHIO\n"+
		"Master constable,--\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"Pray thee, fellow, peace: I do not like thy look,\n"+
		"I promise thee.\n"+
		"Sexton\n"+
		"What heard you him say else?\n"+
		"Second Watchman\n"+
		"Marry, that he had received a thousand ducats of\n"+
		"Don John for accusing the Lady Hero wrongfully.\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"Flat burglary as ever was committed.\n"+
		"VERGES\n"+
		"Yea, by mass, that it is.\n"+
		"Sexton\n"+
		"What else, fellow?\n"+
		"First Watchman\n"+
		"And that Count Claudio did mean, upon his words, to\n"+
		"disgrace Hero before the whole assembly. and not marry her.\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"O villain! thou wilt be condemned into everlasting\n"+
		"redemption for this.\n"+
		"Sexton\n"+
		"What else?\n"+
		"Watchman\n"+
		"This is all.\n"+
		"Sexton\n"+
		"And this is more, masters, than you can deny.\n"+
		"Prince John is this morning secretly stolen away;\n"+
		"Hero was in this manner accused, in this very manner\n"+
		"refused, and upon the grief of this suddenly died.\n"+
		"Master constable, let these men be bound, and\n"+
		"brought to Leonato's: I will go before and show\n"+
		"him their examination.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"Come, let them be opinioned.\n"+
		"VERGES\n"+
		"Let them be in the hands--\n"+
		"CONRADE\n"+
		"Off, coxcomb!\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"God's my life, where's the sexton? let him write\n"+
		"down the prince's officer coxcomb. Come, bind them.\n"+
		"Thou naughty varlet!\n"+
		"CONRADE\n"+
		"Away! you are an ass, you are an ass.\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"Dost thou not suspect my place? dost thou not\n"+
		"suspect my years? O that he were here to write me\n"+
		"down an ass! But, masters, remember that I am an\n"+
		"ass; though it be not written down, yet forget not\n"+
		"that I am an ass. No, thou villain, thou art full of\n"+
		"piety, as shall be proved upon thee by good witness.\n"+
		"I am a wise fellow, and, which is more, an officer,\n"+
		"and, which is more, a householder, and, which is\n"+
		"more, as pretty a piece of flesh as any is in\n"+
		"Messina, and one that knows the law, go to; and a\n"+
		"rich fellow enough, go to; and a fellow that hath\n"+
		"had losses, and one that hath two gowns and every\n"+
		"thing handsome about him. Bring him away. O that\n"+
		"I had been writ down an ass!\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT V\n"+
		"SCENE I. Before LEONATO'S house.\n"+
		"Enter LEONATO and ANTONIO\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"If you go on thus, you will kill yourself:\n"+
		"And 'tis not wisdom thus to second grief\n"+
		"Against yourself.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"I pray thee, cease thy counsel,\n"+
		"Which falls into mine ears as profitless\n"+
		"As water in a sieve: give not me counsel;\n"+
		"Nor let no comforter delight mine ear\n"+
		"But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine.\n"+
		"Bring me a father that so loved his child,\n"+
		"Whose joy of her is overwhelm'd like mine,\n"+
		"And bid him speak of patience;\n"+
		"Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine\n"+
		"And let it answer every strain for strain,\n"+
		"As thus for thus and such a grief for such,\n"+
		"In every lineament, branch, shape, and form:\n"+
		"If such a one will smile and stroke his beard,\n"+
		"Bid sorrow wag, cry 'hem!' when he should groan,\n"+
		"Patch grief with proverbs, make misfortune drunk\n"+
		"With candle-wasters; bring him yet to me,\n"+
		"And I of him will gather patience.\n"+
		"But there is no such man: for, brother, men\n"+
		"Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief\n"+
		"Which they themselves not feel; but, tasting it,\n"+
		"Their counsel turns to passion, which before\n"+
		"Would give preceptial medicine to rage,\n"+
		"Fetter strong madness in a silken thread,\n"+
		"Charm ache with air and agony with words:\n"+
		"No, no; 'tis all men's office to speak patience\n"+
		"To those that wring under the load of sorrow,\n"+
		"But no man's virtue nor sufficiency\n"+
		"To be so moral when he shall endure\n"+
		"The like himself. Therefore give me no counsel:\n"+
		"My griefs cry louder than advertisement.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Therein do men from children nothing differ.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"I pray thee, peace. I will be flesh and blood;\n"+
		"For there was never yet philosopher\n"+
		"That could endure the toothache patiently,\n"+
		"However they have writ the style of gods\n"+
		"And made a push at chance and sufferance.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself;\n"+
		"Make those that do offend you suffer too.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"There thou speak'st reason: nay, I will do so.\n"+
		"My soul doth tell me Hero is belied;\n"+
		"And that shall Claudio know; so shall the prince\n"+
		"And all of them that thus dishonour her.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Here comes the prince and Claudio hastily.\n"+
		"Enter DON PEDRO and CLAUDIO\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Good den, good den.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Good day to both of you.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Hear you. my lords,--\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"We have some haste, Leonato.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Some haste, my lord! well, fare you well, my lord:\n"+
		"Are you so hasty now? well, all is one.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Nay, do not quarrel with us, good old man.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"If he could right himself with quarreling,\n"+
		"Some of us would lie low.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Who wrongs him?\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Marry, thou dost wrong me; thou dissembler, thou:--\n"+
		"Nay, never lay thy hand upon thy sword;\n"+
		"I fear thee not.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Marry, beshrew my hand,\n"+
		"If it should give your age such cause of fear:\n"+
		"In faith, my hand meant nothing to my sword.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Tush, tush, man; never fleer and jest at me:\n"+
		"I speak not like a dotard nor a fool,\n"+
		"As under privilege of age to brag\n"+
		"What I have done being young, or what would do\n"+
		"Were I not old. Know, Claudio, to thy head,\n"+
		"Thou hast so wrong'd mine innocent child and me\n"+
		"That I am forced to lay my reverence by\n"+
		"And, with grey hairs and bruise of many days,\n"+
		"Do challenge thee to trial of a man.\n"+
		"I say thou hast belied mine innocent child;\n"+
		"Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart,\n"+
		"And she lies buried with her ancestors;\n"+
		"O, in a tomb where never scandal slept,\n"+
		"Save this of hers, framed by thy villany!\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"My villany?\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Thine, Claudio; thine, I say.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"You say not right, old man.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"My lord, my lord,\n"+
		"I'll prove it on his body, if he dare,\n"+
		"Despite his nice fence and his active practise,\n"+
		"His May of youth and bloom of lustihood.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Away! I will not have to do with you.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Canst thou so daff me? Thou hast kill'd my child:\n"+
		"If thou kill'st me, boy, thou shalt kill a man.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"He shall kill two of us, and men indeed:\n"+
		"But that's no matter; let him kill one first;\n"+
		"Win me and wear me; let him answer me.\n"+
		"Come, follow me, boy; come, sir boy, come, follow me:\n"+
		"Sir boy, I'll whip you from your foining fence;\n"+
		"Nay, as I am a gentleman, I will.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Brother,--\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Content yourself. God knows I loved my niece;\n"+
		"And she is dead, slander'd to death by villains,\n"+
		"That dare as well answer a man indeed\n"+
		"As I dare take a serpent by the tongue:\n"+
		"Boys, apes, braggarts, Jacks, milksops!\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Brother Antony,--\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Hold you content. What, man! I know them, yea,\n"+
		"And what they weigh, even to the utmost scruple,--\n"+
		"Scrambling, out-facing, fashion-monging boys,\n"+
		"That lie and cog and flout, deprave and slander,\n"+
		"Go anticly, show outward hideousness,\n"+
		"And speak off half a dozen dangerous words,\n"+
		"How they might hurt their enemies, if they durst;\n"+
		"And this is all.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"But, brother Antony,--\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Come, 'tis no matter:\n"+
		"Do not you meddle; let me deal in this.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Gentlemen both, we will not wake your patience.\n"+
		"My heart is sorry for your daughter's death:\n"+
		"But, on my honour, she was charged with nothing\n"+
		"But what was true and very full of proof.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"My lord, my lord,--\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"I will not hear you.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"No? Come, brother; away! I will be heard.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"And shall, or some of us will smart for it.\n"+
		"Exeunt LEONATO and ANTONIO\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"See, see; here comes the man we went to seek.\n"+
		"Enter BENEDICK\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Now, signior, what news?\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Good day, my lord.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Welcome, signior: you are almost come to part\n"+
		"almost a fray.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"We had like to have had our two noses snapped off\n"+
		"with two old men without teeth.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Leonato and his brother. What thinkest thou? Had\n"+
		"we fought, I doubt we should have been too young for them.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"In a false quarrel there is no true valour. I came\n"+
		"to seek you both.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"We have been up and down to seek thee; for we are\n"+
		"high-proof melancholy and would fain have it beaten\n"+
		"away. Wilt thou use thy wit?\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"It is in my scabbard: shall I draw it?\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Dost thou wear thy wit by thy side?\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Never any did so, though very many have been beside\n"+
		"their wit. I will bid thee draw, as we do the\n"+
		"minstrels; draw, to pleasure us.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"As I am an honest man, he looks pale. Art thou\n"+
		"sick, or angry?\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"What, courage, man! What though care killed a cat,\n"+
		"thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Sir, I shall meet your wit in the career, and you\n"+
		"charge it against me. I pray you choose another subject.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Nay, then, give him another staff: this last was\n"+
		"broke cross.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"By this light, he changes more and more: I think\n"+
		"he be angry indeed.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"If he be, he knows how to turn his girdle.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Shall I speak a word in your ear?\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"God bless me from a challenge!\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"[Aside to CLAUDIO] You are a villain; I jest not:\n"+
		"I will make it good how you dare, with what you\n"+
		"dare, and when you dare. Do me right, or I will\n"+
		"protest your cowardice. You have killed a sweet\n"+
		"lady, and her death shall fall heavy on you. Let me\n"+
		"hear from you.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Well, I will meet you, so I may have good cheer.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"What, a feast, a feast?\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"I' faith, I thank him; he hath bid me to a calf's\n"+
		"head and a capon; the which if I do not carve most\n"+
		"curiously, say my knife's naught. Shall I not find\n"+
		"a woodcock too?\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Sir, your wit ambles well; it goes easily.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"I'll tell thee how Beatrice praised thy wit the\n"+
		"other day. I said, thou hadst a fine wit: 'True,'\n"+
		"said she, 'a fine little one.' 'No,' said I, 'a\n"+
		"great wit:' 'Right,' says she, 'a great gross one.'\n"+
		"'Nay,' said I, 'a good wit:' 'Just,' said she, 'it\n"+
		"hurts nobody.' 'Nay,' said I, 'the gentleman\n"+
		"is wise:' 'Certain,' said she, 'a wise gentleman.'\n"+
		"'Nay,' said I, 'he hath the tongues:' 'That I\n"+
		"believe,' said she, 'for he swore a thing to me on\n"+
		"Monday night, which he forswore on Tuesday morning;\n"+
		"there's a double tongue; there's two tongues.' Thus\n"+
		"did she, an hour together, transshape thy particular\n"+
		"virtues: yet at last she concluded with a sigh, thou\n"+
		"wast the properest man in Italy.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"For the which she wept heartily and said she cared\n"+
		"not.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Yea, that she did: but yet, for all that, an if she\n"+
		"did not hate him deadly, she would love him dearly:\n"+
		"the old man's daughter told us all.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"All, all; and, moreover, God saw him when he was\n"+
		"hid in the garden.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"But when shall we set the savage bull's horns on\n"+
		"the sensible Benedick's head?\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Yea, and text underneath, 'Here dwells Benedick the\n"+
		"married man'?\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Fare you well, boy: you know my mind. I will leave\n"+
		"you now to your gossip-like humour: you break jests\n"+
		"as braggarts do their blades, which God be thanked,\n"+
		"hurt not. My lord, for your many courtesies I thank\n"+
		"you: I must discontinue your company: your brother\n"+
		"the bastard is fled from Messina: you have among\n"+
		"you killed a sweet and innocent lady. For my Lord\n"+
		"Lackbeard there, he and I shall meet: and, till\n"+
		"then, peace be with him.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"He is in earnest.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"In most profound earnest; and, I'll warrant you, for\n"+
		"the love of Beatrice.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"And hath challenged thee.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Most sincerely.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"What a pretty thing man is when he goes in his\n"+
		"doublet and hose and leaves off his wit!\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"He is then a giant to an ape; but then is an ape a\n"+
		"doctor to such a man.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"But, soft you, let me be: pluck up, my heart, and\n"+
		"be sad. Did he not say, my brother was fled?\n"+
		"Enter DOGBERRY, VERGES, and the Watch, with CONRADE and BORACHIO\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"Come you, sir: if justice cannot tame you, she\n"+
		"shall ne'er weigh more reasons in her balance: nay,\n"+
		"an you be a cursing hypocrite once, you must be looked to.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"How now? two of my brother's men bound! Borachio\n"+
		"one!\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Hearken after their offence, my lord.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Officers, what offence have these men done?\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"Marry, sir, they have committed false report;\n"+
		"moreover, they have spoken untruths; secondarily,\n"+
		"they are slanders; sixth and lastly, they have\n"+
		"belied a lady; thirdly, they have verified unjust\n"+
		"things; and, to conclude, they are lying knaves.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"First, I ask thee what they have done; thirdly, I\n"+
		"ask thee what's their offence; sixth and lastly, why\n"+
		"they are committed; and, to conclude, what you lay\n"+
		"to their charge.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Rightly reasoned, and in his own division: and, by\n"+
		"my troth, there's one meaning well suited.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Who have you offended, masters, that you are thus\n"+
		"bound to your answer? this learned constable is\n"+
		"too cunning to be understood: what's your offence?\n"+
		"BORACHIO\n"+
		"Sweet prince, let me go no farther to mine answer:\n"+
		"do you hear me, and let this count kill me. I have\n"+
		"deceived even your very eyes: what your wisdoms\n"+
		"could not discover, these shallow fools have brought\n"+
		"to light: who in the night overheard me confessing\n"+
		"to this man how Don John your brother incensed me\n"+
		"to slander the Lady Hero, how you were brought into\n"+
		"the orchard and saw me court Margaret in Hero's\n"+
		"garments, how you disgraced her, when you should\n"+
		"marry her: my villany they have upon record; which\n"+
		"I had rather seal with my death than repeat over\n"+
		"to my shame. The lady is dead upon mine and my\n"+
		"master's false accusation; and, briefly, I desire\n"+
		"nothing but the reward of a villain.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Runs not this speech like iron through your blood?\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"I have drunk poison whiles he utter'd it.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"But did my brother set thee on to this?\n"+
		"BORACHIO\n"+
		"Yea, and paid me richly for the practise of it.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"He is composed and framed of treachery:\n"+
		"And fled he is upon this villany.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Sweet Hero! now thy image doth appear\n"+
		"In the rare semblance that I loved it first.\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"Come, bring away the plaintiffs: by this time our\n"+
		"sexton hath reformed Signior Leonato of the matter:\n"+
		"and, masters, do not forget to specify, when time\n"+
		"and place shall serve, that I am an ass.\n"+
		"VERGES\n"+
		"Here, here comes master Signior Leonato, and the\n"+
		"Sexton too.\n"+
		"Re-enter LEONATO and ANTONIO, with the Sexton\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Which is the villain? let me see his eyes,\n"+
		"That, when I note another man like him,\n"+
		"I may avoid him: which of these is he?\n"+
		"BORACHIO\n"+
		"If you would know your wronger, look on me.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Art thou the slave that with thy breath hast kill'd\n"+
		"Mine innocent child?\n"+
		"BORACHIO\n"+
		"Yea, even I alone.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"No, not so, villain; thou beliest thyself:\n"+
		"Here stand a pair of honourable men;\n"+
		"A third is fled, that had a hand in it.\n"+
		"I thank you, princes, for my daughter's death:\n"+
		"Record it with your high and worthy deeds:\n"+
		"'Twas bravely done, if you bethink you of it.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"I know not how to pray your patience;\n"+
		"Yet I must speak. Choose your revenge yourself;\n"+
		"Impose me to what penance your invention\n"+
		"Can lay upon my sin: yet sinn'd I not\n"+
		"But in mistaking.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"By my soul, nor I:\n"+
		"And yet, to satisfy this good old man,\n"+
		"I would bend under any heavy weight\n"+
		"That he'll enjoin me to.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"I cannot bid you bid my daughter live;\n"+
		"That were impossible: but, I pray you both,\n"+
		"Possess the people in Messina here\n"+
		"How innocent she died; and if your love\n"+
		"Can labour ought in sad invention,\n"+
		"Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb\n"+
		"And sing it to her bones, sing it to-night:\n"+
		"To-morrow morning come you to my house,\n"+
		"And since you could not be my son-in-law,\n"+
		"Be yet my nephew: my brother hath a daughter,\n"+
		"Almost the copy of my child that's dead,\n"+
		"And she alone is heir to both of us:\n"+
		"Give her the right you should have given her cousin,\n"+
		"And so dies my revenge.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"O noble sir,\n"+
		"Your over-kindness doth wring tears from me!\n"+
		"I do embrace your offer; and dispose\n"+
		"For henceforth of poor Claudio.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"To-morrow then I will expect your coming;\n"+
		"To-night I take my leave. This naughty man\n"+
		"Shall face to face be brought to Margaret,\n"+
		"Who I believe was pack'd in all this wrong,\n"+
		"Hired to it by your brother.\n"+
		"BORACHIO\n"+
		"No, by my soul, she was not,\n"+
		"Nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me,\n"+
		"But always hath been just and virtuous\n"+
		"In any thing that I do know by her.\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"Moreover, sir, which indeed is not under white and\n"+
		"black, this plaintiff here, the offender, did call\n"+
		"me ass: I beseech you, let it be remembered in his\n"+
		"punishment. And also, the watch heard them talk of\n"+
		"one Deformed: they say be wears a key in his ear and\n"+
		"a lock hanging by it, and borrows money in God's\n"+
		"name, the which he hath used so long and never paid\n"+
		"that now men grow hard-hearted and will lend nothing\n"+
		"for God's sake: pray you, examine him upon that point.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"I thank thee for thy care and honest pains.\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"Your worship speaks like a most thankful and\n"+
		"reverend youth; and I praise God for you.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"There's for thy pains.\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"God save the foundation!\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Go, I discharge thee of thy prisoner, and I thank thee.\n"+
		"DOGBERRY\n"+
		"I leave an arrant knave with your worship; which I\n"+
		"beseech your worship to correct yourself, for the\n"+
		"example of others. God keep your worship! I wish\n"+
		"your worship well; God restore you to health! I\n"+
		"humbly give you leave to depart; and if a merry\n"+
		"meeting may be wished, God prohibit it! Come, neighbour.\n"+
		"Exeunt DOGBERRY and VERGES\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Until to-morrow morning, lords, farewell.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Farewell, my lords: we look for you to-morrow.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"We will not fail.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"To-night I'll mourn with Hero.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"[To the Watch] Bring you these fellows on. We'll\n"+
		"talk with Margaret,\n"+
		"How her acquaintance grew with this lewd fellow.\n"+
		"Exeunt, severally\n"+
		"SCENE II. LEONATO'S garden.\n"+
		"Enter BENEDICK and MARGARET, meeting\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Pray thee, sweet Mistress Margaret, deserve well at\n"+
		"my hands by helping me to the speech of Beatrice.\n"+
		"MARGARET\n"+
		"Will you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beauty?\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"In so high a style, Margaret, that no man living\n"+
		"shall come over it; for, in most comely truth, thou\n"+
		"deservest it.\n"+
		"MARGARET\n"+
		"To have no man come over me! why, shall I always\n"+
		"keep below stairs?\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Thy wit is as quick as the greyhound's mouth; it catches.\n"+
		"MARGARET\n"+
		"And yours as blunt as the fencer's foils, which hit,\n"+
		"but hurt not.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"A most manly wit, Margaret; it will not hurt a\n"+
		"woman: and so, I pray thee, call Beatrice: I give\n"+
		"thee the bucklers.\n"+
		"MARGARET\n"+
		"Give us the swords; we have bucklers of our own.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"If you use them, Margaret, you must put in the\n"+
		"pikes with a vice; and they are dangerous weapons for maids.\n"+
		"MARGARET\n"+
		"Well, I will call Beatrice to you, who I think hath legs.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"And therefore will come.\n"+
		"Exit MARGARET\n"+
		"Sings\n"+
		"The god of love,\n"+
		"That sits above,\n"+
		"And knows me, and knows me,\n"+
		"How pitiful I deserve,--\n"+
		"I mean in singing; but in loving, Leander the good\n"+
		"swimmer, Troilus the first employer of panders, and\n"+
		"a whole bookful of these quondam carpet-mangers,\n"+
		"whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of a\n"+
		"blank verse, why, they were never so truly turned\n"+
		"over and over as my poor self in love. Marry, I\n"+
		"cannot show it in rhyme; I have tried: I can find\n"+
		"out no rhyme to 'lady' but 'baby,' an innocent\n"+
		"rhyme; for 'scorn,' 'horn,' a hard rhyme; for,\n"+
		"'school,' 'fool,' a babbling rhyme; very ominous\n"+
		"endings: no, I was not born under a rhyming planet,\n"+
		"nor I cannot woo in festival terms.\n"+
		"Enter BEATRICE\n"+
		"Sweet Beatrice, wouldst thou come when I called thee?\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"Yea, signior, and depart when you bid me.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"O, stay but till then!\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"'Then' is spoken; fare you well now: and yet, ere\n"+
		"I go, let me go with that I came; which is, with\n"+
		"knowing what hath passed between you and Claudio.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Only foul words; and thereupon I will kiss thee.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"Foul words is but foul wind, and foul wind is but\n"+
		"foul breath, and foul breath is noisome; therefore I\n"+
		"will depart unkissed.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense,\n"+
		"so forcible is thy wit. But I must tell thee\n"+
		"plainly, Claudio undergoes my challenge; and either\n"+
		"I must shortly hear from him, or I will subscribe\n"+
		"him a coward. And, I pray thee now, tell me for\n"+
		"which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me?\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"For them all together; which maintained so politic\n"+
		"a state of evil that they will not admit any good\n"+
		"part to intermingle with them. But for which of my\n"+
		"good parts did you first suffer love for me?\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Suffer love! a good epithet! I do suffer love\n"+
		"indeed, for I love thee against my will.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"In spite of your heart, I think; alas, poor heart!\n"+
		"If you spite it for my sake, I will spite it for\n"+
		"yours; for I will never love that which my friend hates.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"It appears not in this confession: there's not one\n"+
		"wise man among twenty that will praise himself.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"An old, an old instance, Beatrice, that lived in\n"+
		"the lime of good neighbours. If a man do not erect\n"+
		"in this age his own tomb ere he dies, he shall live\n"+
		"no longer in monument than the bell rings and the\n"+
		"widow weeps.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"And how long is that, think you?\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Question: why, an hour in clamour and a quarter in\n"+
		"rheum: therefore is it most expedient for the\n"+
		"wise, if Don Worm, his conscience, find no\n"+
		"impediment to the contrary, to be the trumpet of his\n"+
		"own virtues, as I am to myself. So much for\n"+
		"praising myself, who, I myself will bear witness, is\n"+
		"praiseworthy: and now tell me, how doth your cousin?\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"Very ill.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"And how do you?\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"Very ill too.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Serve God, love me and mend. There will I leave\n"+
		"you too, for here comes one in haste.\n"+
		"Enter URSULA\n"+
		"URSULA\n"+
		"Madam, you must come to your uncle. Yonder's old\n"+
		"coil at home: it is proved my Lady Hero hath been\n"+
		"falsely accused, the prince and Claudio mightily\n"+
		"abused; and Don John is the author of all, who is\n"+
		"fed and gone. Will you come presently?\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"Will you go hear this news, signior?\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"I will live in thy heart, die in thy lap, and be\n"+
		"buried in thy eyes; and moreover I will go with\n"+
		"thee to thy uncle's.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. A church.\n"+
		"Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, and three or four with tapers\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Is this the monument of Leonato?\n"+
		"Lord\n"+
		"It is, my lord.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"[Reading out of a scroll]\n"+
		"Done to death by slanderous tongues\n"+
		"Was the Hero that here lies:\n"+
		"Death, in guerdon of her wrongs,\n"+
		"Gives her fame which never dies.\n"+
		"So the life that died with shame\n"+
		"Lives in death with glorious fame.\n"+
		"Hang thou there upon the tomb,\n"+
		"Praising her when I am dumb.\n"+
		"Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.\n"+
		"SONG.\n"+
		"Pardon, goddess of the night,\n"+
		"Those that slew thy virgin knight;\n"+
		"For the which, with songs of woe,\n"+
		"Round about her tomb they go.\n"+
		"Midnight, assist our moan;\n"+
		"Help us to sigh and groan,\n"+
		"Heavily, heavily:\n"+
		"Graves, yawn and yield your dead,\n"+
		"Till death be uttered,\n"+
		"Heavily, heavily.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Now, unto thy bones good night!\n"+
		"Yearly will I do this rite.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Good morrow, masters; put your torches out:\n"+
		"The wolves have prey'd; and look, the gentle day,\n"+
		"Before the wheels of Phoebus, round about\n"+
		"Dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey.\n"+
		"Thanks to you all, and leave us: fare you well.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Good morrow, masters: each his several way.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Come, let us hence, and put on other weeds;\n"+
		"And then to Leonato's we will go.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"And Hymen now with luckier issue speed's\n"+
		"Than this for whom we render'd up this woe.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV. A room in LEONATO'S house.\n"+
		"Enter LEONATO, ANTONIO, BENEDICK, BEATRICE, MARGARET, URSULA, FRIAR FRANCIS, and HERO\n"+
		"FRIAR FRANCIS\n"+
		"Did I not tell you she was innocent?\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"So are the prince and Claudio, who accused her\n"+
		"Upon the error that you heard debated:\n"+
		"But Margaret was in some fault for this,\n"+
		"Although against her will, as it appears\n"+
		"In the true course of all the question.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Well, I am glad that all things sort so well.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"And so am I, being else by faith enforced\n"+
		"To call young Claudio to a reckoning for it.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Well, daughter, and you gentle-women all,\n"+
		"Withdraw into a chamber by yourselves,\n"+
		"And when I send for you, come hither mask'd.\n"+
		"Exeunt Ladies\n"+
		"The prince and Claudio promised by this hour\n"+
		"To visit me. You know your office, brother:\n"+
		"You must be father to your brother's daughter\n"+
		"And give her to young Claudio.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Which I will do with confirm'd countenance.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Friar, I must entreat your pains, I think.\n"+
		"FRIAR FRANCIS\n"+
		"To do what, signior?\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"To bind me, or undo me; one of them.\n"+
		"Signior Leonato, truth it is, good signior,\n"+
		"Your niece regards me with an eye of favour.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"That eye my daughter lent her: 'tis most true.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"And I do with an eye of love requite her.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"The sight whereof I think you had from me,\n"+
		"From Claudio and the prince: but what's your will?\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Your answer, sir, is enigmatical:\n"+
		"But, for my will, my will is your good will\n"+
		"May stand with ours, this day to be conjoin'd\n"+
		"In the state of honourable marriage:\n"+
		"In which, good friar, I shall desire your help.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"My heart is with your liking.\n"+
		"FRIAR FRANCIS\n"+
		"And my help.\n"+
		"Here comes the prince and Claudio.\n"+
		"Enter DON PEDRO and CLAUDIO, and two or three others\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Good morrow to this fair assembly.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Good morrow, prince; good morrow, Claudio:\n"+
		"We here attend you. Are you yet determined\n"+
		"To-day to marry with my brother's daughter?\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"I'll hold my mind, were she an Ethiope.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Call her forth, brother; here's the friar ready.\n"+
		"Exit ANTONIO\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"Good morrow, Benedick. Why, what's the matter,\n"+
		"That you have such a February face,\n"+
		"So full of frost, of storm and cloudiness?\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"I think he thinks upon the savage bull.\n"+
		"Tush, fear not, man; we'll tip thy horns with gold\n"+
		"And all Europa shall rejoice at thee,\n"+
		"As once Europa did at lusty Jove,\n"+
		"When he would play the noble beast in love.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Bull Jove, sir, had an amiable low;\n"+
		"And some such strange bull leap'd your father's cow,\n"+
		"And got a calf in that same noble feat\n"+
		"Much like to you, for you have just his bleat.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"For this I owe you: here comes other reckonings.\n"+
		"Re-enter ANTONIO, with the Ladies masked\n"+
		"Which is the lady I must seize upon?\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"This same is she, and I do give you her.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Why, then she's mine. Sweet, let me see your face.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"No, that you shall not, till you take her hand\n"+
		"Before this friar and swear to marry her.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Give me your hand: before this holy friar,\n"+
		"I am your husband, if you like of me.\n"+
		"HERO\n"+
		"And when I lived, I was your other wife:\n"+
		"Unmasking\n"+
		"And when you loved, you were my other husband.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Another Hero!\n"+
		"HERO\n"+
		"Nothing certainer:\n"+
		"One Hero died defiled, but I do live,\n"+
		"And surely as I live, I am a maid.\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"The former Hero! Hero that is dead!\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"She died, my lord, but whiles her slander lived.\n"+
		"FRIAR FRANCIS\n"+
		"All this amazement can I qualify:\n"+
		"When after that the holy rites are ended,\n"+
		"I'll tell you largely of fair Hero's death:\n"+
		"Meantime let wonder seem familiar,\n"+
		"And to the chapel let us presently.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Soft and fair, friar. Which is Beatrice?\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"[Unmasking] I answer to that name. What is your will?\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Do not you love me?\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"Why, no; no more than reason.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Why, then your uncle and the prince and Claudio\n"+
		"Have been deceived; they swore you did.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"Do not you love me?\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Troth, no; no more than reason.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"Why, then my cousin Margaret and Ursula\n"+
		"Are much deceived; for they did swear you did.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"They swore that you were almost sick for me.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"They swore that you were well-nigh dead for me.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"'Tis no such matter. Then you do not love me?\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"No, truly, but in friendly recompense.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"Come, cousin, I am sure you love the gentleman.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"And I'll be sworn upon't that he loves her;\n"+
		"For here's a paper written in his hand,\n"+
		"A halting sonnet of his own pure brain,\n"+
		"Fashion'd to Beatrice.\n"+
		"HERO\n"+
		"And here's another\n"+
		"Writ in my cousin's hand, stolen from her pocket,\n"+
		"Containing her affection unto Benedick.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"A miracle! here's our own hands against our hearts.\n"+
		"Come, I will have thee; but, by this light, I take\n"+
		"thee for pity.\n"+
		"BEATRICE\n"+
		"I would not deny you; but, by this good day, I yield\n"+
		"upon great persuasion; and partly to save your life,\n"+
		"for I was told you were in a consumption.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Peace! I will stop your mouth.\n"+
		"Kissing her\n"+
		"DON PEDRO\n"+
		"How dost thou, Benedick, the married man?\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"I'll tell thee what, prince; a college of\n"+
		"wit-crackers cannot flout me out of my humour. Dost\n"+
		"thou think I care for a satire or an epigram? No:\n"+
		"if a man will be beaten with brains, a' shall wear\n"+
		"nothing handsome about him. In brief, since I do\n"+
		"purpose to marry, I will think nothing to any\n"+
		"purpose that the world can say against it; and\n"+
		"therefore never flout at me for what I have said\n"+
		"against it; for man is a giddy thing, and this is my\n"+
		"conclusion. For thy part, Claudio, I did think to\n"+
		"have beaten thee, but in that thou art like to be my\n"+
		"kinsman, live unbruised and love my cousin.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"I had well hoped thou wouldst have denied Beatrice,\n"+
		"that I might have cudgelled thee out of thy single\n"+
		"life, to make thee a double-dealer; which, out of\n"+
		"question, thou wilt be, if my cousin do not look\n"+
		"exceedingly narrowly to thee.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Come, come, we are friends: let's have a dance ere\n"+
		"we are married, that we may lighten our own hearts\n"+
		"and our wives' heels.\n"+
		"LEONATO\n"+
		"We'll have dancing afterward.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"First, of my word; therefore play, music. Prince,\n"+
		"thou art sad; get thee a wife, get thee a wife:\n"+
		"there is no staff more reverend than one tipped with horn.\n"+
		"Enter a Messenger\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"My lord, your brother John is ta'en in flight,\n"+
		"And brought with armed men back to Messina.\n"+
		"BENEDICK\n"+
		"Think not on him till to-morrow:\n"+
		"I'll devise thee brave punishments for him.\n"+
		"Strike up, pipers.\n"+
		"Dance\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"
