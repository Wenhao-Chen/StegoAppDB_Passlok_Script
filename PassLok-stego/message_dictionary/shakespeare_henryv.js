		"ACT I\n"+
		"PROLOGUE\n"+
		"Enter Chorus\n"+
		"Chorus\n"+
		"O for a Muse of fire, that would ascend\n"+
		"The brightest heaven of invention,\n"+
		"A kingdom for a stage, princes to act\n"+
		"And monarchs to behold the swelling scene!\n"+
		"Then should the warlike Harry, like himself,\n"+
		"Assume the port of Mars; and at his heels,\n"+
		"Leash'd in like hounds, should famine, sword and fire\n"+
		"Crouch for employment. But pardon, and gentles all,\n"+
		"The flat unraised spirits that have dared\n"+
		"On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth\n"+
		"So great an object: can this cockpit hold\n"+
		"The vasty fields of France? or may we cram\n"+
		"Within this wooden O the very casques\n"+
		"That did affright the air at Agincourt?\n"+
		"O, pardon! since a crooked figure may\n"+
		"Attest in little place a million;\n"+
		"And let us, ciphers to this great accompt,\n"+
		"On your imaginary forces work.\n"+
		"Suppose within the girdle of these walls\n"+
		"Are now confined two mighty monarchies,\n"+
		"Whose high upreared and abutting fronts\n"+
		"The perilous narrow ocean parts asunder:\n"+
		"Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts;\n"+
		"Into a thousand parts divide on man,\n"+
		"And make imaginary puissance;\n"+
		"Think when we talk of horses, that you see them\n"+
		"Printing their proud hoofs i' the receiving earth;\n"+
		"For 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings,\n"+
		"Carry them here and there; jumping o'er times,\n"+
		"Turning the accomplishment of many years\n"+
		"Into an hour-glass: for the which supply,\n"+
		"Admit me Chorus to this history;\n"+
		"Who prologue-like your humble patience pray,\n"+
		"Gently to hear, kindly to judge, our play.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE I. London. An ante-chamber in the KING'S palace.\n"+
		"Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, and the BISHOP OF ELY\n"+
		"CANTERBURY\n"+
		"My lord, I'll tell you; that self bill is urged,\n"+
		"Which in the eleventh year of the last king's reign\n"+
		"Was like, and had indeed against us pass'd,\n"+
		"But that the scambling and unquiet time\n"+
		"Did push it out of farther question.\n"+
		"ELY\n"+
		"But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?\n"+
		"CANTERBURY\n"+
		"It must be thought on. If it pass against us,\n"+
		"We lose the better half of our possession:\n"+
		"For all the temporal lands which men devout\n"+
		"By testament have given to the church\n"+
		"Would they strip from us; being valued thus:\n"+
		"As much as would maintain, to the king's honour,\n"+
		"Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights,\n"+
		"Six thousand and two hundred good esquires;\n"+
		"And, to relief of lazars and weak age,\n"+
		"Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil.\n"+
		"A hundred almshouses right well supplied;\n"+
		"And to the coffers of the king beside,\n"+
		"A thousand pounds by the year: thus runs the bill.\n"+
		"ELY\n"+
		"This would drink deep.\n"+
		"CANTERBURY\n"+
		"'Twould drink the cup and all.\n"+
		"ELY\n"+
		"But what prevention?\n"+
		"CANTERBURY\n"+
		"The king is full of grace and fair regard.\n"+
		"ELY\n"+
		"And a true lover of the holy church.\n"+
		"CANTERBURY\n"+
		"The courses of his youth promised it not.\n"+
		"The breath no sooner left his father's body,\n"+
		"But that his wildness, mortified in him,\n"+
		"Seem'd to die too; yea, at that very moment\n"+
		"Consideration, like an angel, came\n"+
		"And whipp'd the offending Adam out of him,\n"+
		"Leaving his body as a paradise,\n"+
		"To envelop and contain celestial spirits.\n"+
		"Never was such a sudden scholar made;\n"+
		"Never came reformation in a flood,\n"+
		"With such a heady currance, scouring faults\n"+
		"Nor never Hydra-headed wilfulness\n"+
		"So soon did lose his seat and all at once\n"+
		"As in this king.\n"+
		"ELY\n"+
		"We are blessed in the change.\n"+
		"CANTERBURY\n"+
		"Hear him but reason in divinity,\n"+
		"And all-admiring with an inward wish\n"+
		"You would desire the king were made a prelate:\n"+
		"Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs,\n"+
		"You would say it hath been all in all his study:\n"+
		"List his discourse of war, and you shall hear\n"+
		"A fearful battle render'd you in music:\n"+
		"Turn him to any cause of policy,\n"+
		"The Gordian knot of it he will unloose,\n"+
		"Familiar as his garter: that, when he speaks,\n"+
		"The air, a charter'd libertine, is still,\n"+
		"And the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears,\n"+
		"To steal his sweet and honey'd sentences;\n"+
		"So that the art and practic part of life\n"+
		"Must be the mistress to this theoric:\n"+
		"Which is a wonder how his grace should glean it,\n"+
		"Since his addiction was to courses vain,\n"+
		"His companies unletter'd, rude and shallow,\n"+
		"His hours fill'd up with riots, banquets, sports,\n"+
		"And never noted in him any study,\n"+
		"Any retirement, any sequestration\n"+
		"From open haunts and popularity.\n"+
		"ELY\n"+
		"The strawberry grows underneath the nettle\n"+
		"And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best\n"+
		"Neighbour'd by fruit of baser quality:\n"+
		"And so the prince obscured his contemplation\n"+
		"Under the veil of wildness; which, no doubt,\n"+
		"Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night,\n"+
		"Unseen, yet crescive in his faculty.\n"+
		"CANTERBURY\n"+
		"It must be so; for miracles are ceased;\n"+
		"And therefore we must needs admit the means\n"+
		"How things are perfected.\n"+
		"ELY\n"+
		"But, my good lord,\n"+
		"How now for mitigation of this bill\n"+
		"Urged by the commons? Doth his majesty\n"+
		"Incline to it, or no?\n"+
		"CANTERBURY\n"+
		"He seems indifferent,\n"+
		"Or rather swaying more upon our part\n"+
		"Than cherishing the exhibiters against us;\n"+
		"For I have made an offer to his majesty,\n"+
		"Upon our spiritual convocation\n"+
		"And in regard of causes now in hand,\n"+
		"Which I have open'd to his grace at large,\n"+
		"As touching France, to give a greater sum\n"+
		"Than ever at one time the clergy yet\n"+
		"Did to his predecessors part withal.\n"+
		"ELY\n"+
		"How did this offer seem received, my lord?\n"+
		"CANTERBURY\n"+
		"With good acceptance of his majesty;\n"+
		"Save that there was not time enough to hear,\n"+
		"As I perceived his grace would fain have done,\n"+
		"The severals and unhidden passages\n"+
		"Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms\n"+
		"And generally to the crown and seat of France\n"+
		"Derived from Edward, his great-grandfather.\n"+
		"ELY\n"+
		"What was the impediment that broke this off?\n"+
		"CANTERBURY\n"+
		"The French ambassador upon that instant\n"+
		"Craved audience; and the hour, I think, is come\n"+
		"To give him hearing: is it four o'clock?\n"+
		"ELY\n"+
		"It is.\n"+
		"CANTERBURY\n"+
		"Then go we in, to know his embassy;\n"+
		"Which I could with a ready guess declare,\n"+
		"Before the Frenchman speak a word of it.\n"+
		"ELY\n"+
		"I'll wait upon you, and I long to hear it.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. The same. The Presence chamber.\n"+
		"Enter KING HENRY V, GLOUCESTER, BEDFORD, EXETER, WARWICK, WESTMORELAND, and Attendants\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury?\n"+
		"EXETER\n"+
		"Not here in presence.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Send for him, good uncle.\n"+
		"WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"Shall we call in the ambassador, my liege?\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Not yet, my cousin: we would be resolved,\n"+
		"Before we hear him, of some things of weight\n"+
		"That task our thoughts, concerning us and France.\n"+
		"Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, and the BISHOP of ELY\n"+
		"CANTERBURY\n"+
		"God and his angels guard your sacred throne\n"+
		"And make you long become it!\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Sure, we thank you.\n"+
		"My learned lord, we pray you to proceed\n"+
		"And justly and religiously unfold\n"+
		"Why the law Salique that they have in France\n"+
		"Or should, or should not, bar us in our claim:\n"+
		"And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,\n"+
		"That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,\n"+
		"Or nicely charge your understanding soul\n"+
		"With opening titles miscreate, whose right\n"+
		"Suits not in native colours with the truth;\n"+
		"For God doth know how many now in health\n"+
		"Shall drop their blood in approbation\n"+
		"Of what your reverence shall incite us to.\n"+
		"Therefore take heed how you impawn our person,\n"+
		"How you awake our sleeping sword of war:\n"+
		"We charge you, in the name of God, take heed;\n"+
		"For never two such kingdoms did contend\n"+
		"Without much fall of blood; whose guiltless drops\n"+
		"Are every one a woe, a sore complaint\n"+
		"'Gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the swords\n"+
		"That make such waste in brief mortality.\n"+
		"Under this conjuration, speak, my lord;\n"+
		"For we will hear, note and believe in heart\n"+
		"That what you speak is in your conscience wash'd\n"+
		"As pure as sin with baptism.\n"+
		"CANTERBURY\n"+
		"Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,\n"+
		"That owe yourselves, your lives and services\n"+
		"To this imperial throne. There is no bar\n"+
		"To make against your highness' claim to France\n"+
		"But this, which they produce from Pharamond,\n"+
		"'In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant:'\n"+
		"'No woman shall succeed in Salique land:'\n"+
		"Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze\n"+
		"To be the realm of France, and Pharamond\n"+
		"The founder of this law and female bar.\n"+
		"Yet their own authors faithfully affirm\n"+
		"That the land Salique is in Germany,\n"+
		"Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;\n"+
		"Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,\n"+
		"There left behind and settled certain French;\n"+
		"Who, holding in disdain the German women\n"+
		"For some dishonest manners of their life,\n"+
		"Establish'd then this law; to wit, no female\n"+
		"Should be inheritrix in Salique land:\n"+
		"Which Salique, as I said, 'twixt Elbe and Sala,\n"+
		"Is at this day in Germany call'd Meisen.\n"+
		"Then doth it well appear that Salique law\n"+
		"Was not devised for the realm of France:\n"+
		"Nor did the French possess the Salique land\n"+
		"Until four hundred one and twenty years\n"+
		"After defunction of King Pharamond,\n"+
		"Idly supposed the founder of this law;\n"+
		"Who died within the year of our redemption\n"+
		"Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great\n"+
		"Subdued the Saxons, and did seat the French\n"+
		"Beyond the river Sala, in the year\n"+
		"Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,\n"+
		"King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,\n"+
		"Did, as heir general, being descended\n"+
		"Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,\n"+
		"Make claim and title to the crown of France.\n"+
		"Hugh Capet also, who usurped the crown\n"+
		"Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male\n"+
		"Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,\n"+
		"To find his title with some shows of truth,\n"+
		"'Through, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,\n"+
		"Convey'd himself as heir to the Lady Lingare,\n"+
		"Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son\n"+
		"To Lewis the emperor, and Lewis the son\n"+
		"Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,\n"+
		"Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,\n"+
		"Could not keep quiet in his conscience,\n"+
		"Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied\n"+
		"That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,\n"+
		"Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,\n"+
		"Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine:\n"+
		"By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great\n"+
		"Was re-united to the crown of France.\n"+
		"So that, as clear as is the summer's sun.\n"+
		"King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,\n"+
		"King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear\n"+
		"To hold in right and title of the female:\n"+
		"So do the kings of France unto this day;\n"+
		"Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law\n"+
		"To bar your highness claiming from the female,\n"+
		"And rather choose to hide them in a net\n"+
		"Than amply to imbar their crooked titles\n"+
		"Usurp'd from you and your progenitors.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"May I with right and conscience make this claim?\n"+
		"CANTERBURY\n"+
		"The sin upon my head, dread sovereign!\n"+
		"For in the book of Numbers is it writ,\n"+
		"When the man dies, let the inheritance\n"+
		"Descend unto the daughter. Gracious lord,\n"+
		"Stand for your own; unwind your bloody flag;\n"+
		"Look back into your mighty ancestors:\n"+
		"Go, my dread lord, to your great-grandsire's tomb,\n"+
		"From whom you claim; invoke his warlike spirit,\n"+
		"And your great-uncle's, Edward the Black Prince,\n"+
		"Who on the French ground play'd a tragedy,\n"+
		"Making defeat on the full power of France,\n"+
		"Whiles his most mighty father on a hill\n"+
		"Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp\n"+
		"Forage in blood of French nobility.\n"+
		"O noble English. that could entertain\n"+
		"With half their forces the full Pride of France\n"+
		"And let another half stand laughing by,\n"+
		"All out of work and cold for action!\n"+
		"ELY\n"+
		"Awake remembrance of these valiant dead\n"+
		"And with your puissant arm renew their feats:\n"+
		"You are their heir; you sit upon their throne;\n"+
		"The blood and courage that renowned them\n"+
		"Runs in your veins; and my thrice-puissant liege\n"+
		"Is in the very May-morn of his youth,\n"+
		"Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises.\n"+
		"EXETER\n"+
		"Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth\n"+
		"Do all expect that you should rouse yourself,\n"+
		"As did the former lions of your blood.\n"+
		"WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"They know your grace hath cause and means and might;\n"+
		"So hath your highness; never king of England\n"+
		"Had nobles richer and more loyal subjects,\n"+
		"Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England\n"+
		"And lie pavilion'd in the fields of France.\n"+
		"CANTERBURY\n"+
		"O, let their bodies follow, my dear liege,\n"+
		"With blood and sword and fire to win your right;\n"+
		"In aid whereof we of the spiritualty\n"+
		"Will raise your highness such a mighty sum\n"+
		"As never did the clergy at one time\n"+
		"Bring in to any of your ancestors.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"We must not only arm to invade the French,\n"+
		"But lay down our proportions to defend\n"+
		"Against the Scot, who will make road upon us\n"+
		"With all advantages.\n"+
		"CANTERBURY\n"+
		"They of those marches, gracious sovereign,\n"+
		"Shall be a wall sufficient to defend\n"+
		"Our inland from the pilfering borderers.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"We do not mean the coursing snatchers only,\n"+
		"But fear the main intendment of the Scot,\n"+
		"Who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us;\n"+
		"For you shall read that my great-grandfather\n"+
		"Never went with his forces into France\n"+
		"But that the Scot on his unfurnish'd kingdom\n"+
		"Came pouring, like the tide into a breach,\n"+
		"With ample and brim fulness of his force,\n"+
		"Galling the gleaned land with hot assays,\n"+
		"Girding with grievous siege castles and towns;\n"+
		"That England, being empty of defence,\n"+
		"Hath shook and trembled at the ill neighbourhood.\n"+
		"CANTERBURY\n"+
		"She hath been then more fear'd than harm'd, my liege;\n"+
		"For hear her but exampled by herself:\n"+
		"When all her chivalry hath been in France\n"+
		"And she a mourning widow of her nobles,\n"+
		"She hath herself not only well defended\n"+
		"But taken and impounded as a stray\n"+
		"The King of Scots; whom she did send to France,\n"+
		"To fill King Edward's fame with prisoner kings\n"+
		"And make her chronicle as rich with praise\n"+
		"As is the ooze and bottom of the sea\n"+
		"With sunken wreck and sunless treasuries.\n"+
		"WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"But there's a saying very old and true,\n"+
		"'If that you will France win,\n"+
		"Then with Scotland first begin:'\n"+
		"For once the eagle England being in prey,\n"+
		"To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot\n"+
		"Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs,\n"+
		"Playing the mouse in absence of the cat,\n"+
		"To tear and havoc more than she can eat.\n"+
		"EXETER\n"+
		"It follows then the cat must stay at home:\n"+
		"Yet that is but a crush'd necessity,\n"+
		"Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries,\n"+
		"And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves.\n"+
		"While that the armed hand doth fight abroad,\n"+
		"The advised head defends itself at home;\n"+
		"For government, though high and low and lower,\n"+
		"Put into parts, doth keep in one consent,\n"+
		"Congreeing in a full and natural close,\n"+
		"Like music.\n"+
		"CANTERBURY\n"+
		"Therefore doth heaven divide\n"+
		"The state of man in divers functions,\n"+
		"Setting endeavour in continual motion;\n"+
		"To which is fixed, as an aim or butt,\n"+
		"Obedience: for so work the honey-bees,\n"+
		"Creatures that by a rule in nature teach\n"+
		"The act of order to a peopled kingdom.\n"+
		"They have a king and officers of sorts;\n"+
		"Where some, like magistrates, correct at home,\n"+
		"Others, like merchants, venture trade abroad,\n"+
		"Others, like soldiers, armed in their stings,\n"+
		"Make boot upon the summer's velvet buds,\n"+
		"Which pillage they with merry march bring home\n"+
		"To the tent-royal of their emperor;\n"+
		"Who, busied in his majesty, surveys\n"+
		"The singing masons building roofs of gold,\n"+
		"The civil citizens kneading up the honey,\n"+
		"The poor mechanic porters crowding in\n"+
		"Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate,\n"+
		"The sad-eyed justice, with his surly hum,\n"+
		"Delivering o'er to executors pale\n"+
		"The lazy yawning drone. I this infer,\n"+
		"That many things, having full reference\n"+
		"To one consent, may work contrariously:\n"+
		"As many arrows, loosed several ways,\n"+
		"Come to one mark; as many ways meet in one town;\n"+
		"As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea;\n"+
		"As many lines close in the dial's centre;\n"+
		"So may a thousand actions, once afoot.\n"+
		"End in one purpose, and be all well borne\n"+
		"Without defeat. Therefore to France, my liege.\n"+
		"Divide your happy England into four;\n"+
		"Whereof take you one quarter into France,\n"+
		"And you withal shall make all Gallia shake.\n"+
		"If we, with thrice such powers left at home,\n"+
		"Cannot defend our own doors from the dog,\n"+
		"Let us be worried and our nation lose\n"+
		"The name of hardiness and policy.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin.\n"+
		"Exeunt some Attendants\n"+
		"Now are we well resolved; and, by God's help,\n"+
		"And yours, the noble sinews of our power,\n"+
		"France being ours, we'll bend it to our awe,\n"+
		"Or break it all to pieces: or there we'll sit,\n"+
		"Ruling in large and ample empery\n"+
		"O'er France and all her almost kingly dukedoms,\n"+
		"Or lay these bones in an unworthy urn,\n"+
		"Tombless, with no remembrance over them:\n"+
		"Either our history shall with full mouth\n"+
		"Speak freely of our acts, or else our grave,\n"+
		"Like Turkish mute, shall have a tongueless mouth,\n"+
		"Not worshipp'd with a waxen epitaph.\n"+
		"Enter Ambassadors of France\n"+
		"Now are we well prepared to know the pleasure\n"+
		"Of our fair cousin Dauphin; for we hear\n"+
		"Your greeting is from him, not from the king.\n"+
		"First Ambassador\n"+
		"May't please your majesty to give us leave\n"+
		"Freely to render what we have in charge;\n"+
		"Or shall we sparingly show you far off\n"+
		"The Dauphin's meaning and our embassy?\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"We are no tyrant, but a Christian king;\n"+
		"Unto whose grace our passion is as subject\n"+
		"As are our wretches fetter'd in our prisons:\n"+
		"Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness\n"+
		"Tell us the Dauphin's mind.\n"+
		"First Ambassador\n"+
		"Thus, then, in few.\n"+
		"Your highness, lately sending into France,\n"+
		"Did claim some certain dukedoms, in the right\n"+
		"Of your great predecessor, King Edward the Third.\n"+
		"In answer of which claim, the prince our master\n"+
		"Says that you savour too much of your youth,\n"+
		"And bids you be advised there's nought in France\n"+
		"That can be with a nimble galliard won;\n"+
		"You cannot revel into dukedoms there.\n"+
		"He therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit,\n"+
		"This tun of treasure; and, in lieu of this,\n"+
		"Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim\n"+
		"Hear no more of you. This the Dauphin speaks.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"What treasure, uncle?\n"+
		"EXETER\n"+
		"Tennis-balls, my liege.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us;\n"+
		"His present and your pains we thank you for:\n"+
		"When we have march'd our rackets to these balls,\n"+
		"We will, in France, by God's grace, play a set\n"+
		"Shall strike his father's crown into the hazard.\n"+
		"Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler\n"+
		"That all the courts of France will be disturb'd\n"+
		"With chaces. And we understand him well,\n"+
		"How he comes o'er us with our wilder days,\n"+
		"Not measuring what use we made of them.\n"+
		"We never valued this poor seat of England;\n"+
		"And therefore, living hence, did give ourself\n"+
		"To barbarous licence; as 'tis ever common\n"+
		"That men are merriest when they are from home.\n"+
		"But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state,\n"+
		"Be like a king and show my sail of greatness\n"+
		"When I do rouse me in my throne of France:\n"+
		"For that I have laid by my majesty\n"+
		"And plodded like a man for working-days,\n"+
		"But I will rise there with so full a glory\n"+
		"That I will dazzle all the eyes of France,\n"+
		"Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us.\n"+
		"And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his\n"+
		"Hath turn'd his balls to gun-stones; and his soul\n"+
		"Shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance\n"+
		"That shall fly with them: for many a thousand widows\n"+
		"Shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands;\n"+
		"Mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down;\n"+
		"And some are yet ungotten and unborn\n"+
		"That shall have cause to curse the Dauphin's scorn.\n"+
		"But this lies all within the will of God,\n"+
		"To whom I do appeal; and in whose name\n"+
		"Tell you the Dauphin I am coming on,\n"+
		"To venge me as I may and to put forth\n"+
		"My rightful hand in a well-hallow'd cause.\n"+
		"So get you hence in peace; and tell the Dauphin\n"+
		"His jest will savour but of shallow wit,\n"+
		"When thousands weep more than did laugh at it.\n"+
		"Convey them with safe conduct. Fare you well.\n"+
		"Exeunt Ambassadors\n"+
		"EXETER\n"+
		"This was a merry message.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"We hope to make the sender blush at it.\n"+
		"Therefore, my lords, omit no happy hour\n"+
		"That may give furtherance to our expedition;\n"+
		"For we have now no thought in us but France,\n"+
		"Save those to God, that run before our business.\n"+
		"Therefore let our proportions for these wars\n"+
		"Be soon collected and all things thought upon\n"+
		"That may with reasonable swiftness add\n"+
		"More feathers to our wings; for, God before,\n"+
		"We'll chide this Dauphin at his father's door.\n"+
		"Therefore let every man now task his thought,\n"+
		"That this fair action may on foot be brought.\n"+
		"Exeunt. Flourish\n"+
		"ACT II\n"+
		"PROLOGUE\n"+
		"Enter Chorus\n"+
		"Chorus\n"+
		"Now all the youth of England are on fire,\n"+
		"And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies:\n"+
		"Now thrive the armourers, and honour's thought\n"+
		"Reigns solely in the breast of every man:\n"+
		"They sell the pasture now to buy the horse,\n"+
		"Following the mirror of all Christian kings,\n"+
		"With winged heels, as English Mercuries.\n"+
		"For now sits Expectation in the air,\n"+
		"And hides a sword from hilts unto the point\n"+
		"With crowns imperial, crowns and coronets,\n"+
		"Promised to Harry and his followers.\n"+
		"The French, advised by good intelligence\n"+
		"Of this most dreadful preparation,\n"+
		"Shake in their fear and with pale policy\n"+
		"Seek to divert the English purposes.\n"+
		"O England! model to thy inward greatness,\n"+
		"Like little body with a mighty heart,\n"+
		"What mightst thou do, that honour would thee do,\n"+
		"Were all thy children kind and natural!\n"+
		"But see thy fault! France hath in thee found out\n"+
		"A nest of hollow bosoms, which he fills\n"+
		"With treacherous crowns; and three corrupted men,\n"+
		"One, Richard Earl of Cambridge, and the second,\n"+
		"Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third,\n"+
		"Sir Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland,\n"+
		"Have, for the gilt of France,--O guilt indeed!\n"+
		"Confirm'd conspiracy with fearful France;\n"+
		"And by their hands this grace of kings must die,\n"+
		"If hell and treason hold their promises,\n"+
		"Ere he take ship for France, and in Southampton.\n"+
		"Linger your patience on; and we'll digest\n"+
		"The abuse of distance; force a play:\n"+
		"The sum is paid; the traitors are agreed;\n"+
		"The king is set from London; and the scene\n"+
		"Is now transported, gentles, to Southampton;\n"+
		"There is the playhouse now, there must you sit:\n"+
		"And thence to France shall we convey you safe,\n"+
		"And bring you back, charming the narrow seas\n"+
		"To give you gentle pass; for, if we may,\n"+
		"We'll not offend one stomach with our play.\n"+
		"But, till the king come forth, and not till then,\n"+
		"Unto Southampton do we shift our scene.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE I. London. A street.\n"+
		"Enter Corporal NYM and Lieutenant BARDOLPH\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Well met, Corporal Nym.\n"+
		"NYM\n"+
		"Good morrow, Lieutenant Bardolph.\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"What, are Ancient Pistol and you friends yet?\n"+
		"NYM\n"+
		"For my part, I care not: I say little; but when\n"+
		"time shall serve, there shall be smiles; but that\n"+
		"shall be as it may. I dare not fight; but I will\n"+
		"wink and hold out mine iron: it is a simple one; but\n"+
		"what though? it will toast cheese, and it will\n"+
		"endure cold as another man's sword will: and\n"+
		"there's an end.\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"I will bestow a breakfast to make you friends; and\n"+
		"we'll be all three sworn brothers to France: let it\n"+
		"be so, good Corporal Nym.\n"+
		"NYM\n"+
		"Faith, I will live so long as I may, that's the\n"+
		"certain of it; and when I cannot live any longer, I\n"+
		"will do as I may: that is my rest, that is the\n"+
		"rendezvous of it.\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"It is certain, corporal, that he is married to Nell\n"+
		"Quickly: and certainly she did you wrong; for you\n"+
		"were troth-plight to her.\n"+
		"NYM\n"+
		"I cannot tell: things must be as they may: men may\n"+
		"sleep, and they may have their throats about them at\n"+
		"that time; and some say knives have edges. It must\n"+
		"be as it may: though patience be a tired mare, yet\n"+
		"she will plod. There must be conclusions. Well, I\n"+
		"cannot tell.\n"+
		"Enter PISTOL and Hostess\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Here comes Ancient Pistol and his wife: good\n"+
		"corporal, be patient here. How now, mine host Pistol!\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"Base tike, call'st thou me host? Now, by this hand,\n"+
		"I swear, I scorn the term; Nor shall my Nell keep lodgers.\n"+
		"Hostess\n"+
		"No, by my troth, not long; for we cannot lodge and\n"+
		"board a dozen or fourteen gentlewomen that live\n"+
		"honestly by the prick of their needles, but it will\n"+
		"be thought we keep a bawdy house straight.\n"+
		"NYM and PISTOL draw\n"+
		"O well a day, Lady, if he be not drawn now! we\n"+
		"shall see wilful adultery and murder committed.\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Good lieutenant! good corporal! offer nothing here.\n"+
		"NYM\n"+
		"Pish!\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"Pish for thee, Iceland dog! thou prick-ear'd cur of Iceland!\n"+
		"Hostess\n"+
		"Good Corporal Nym, show thy valour, and put up your sword.\n"+
		"NYM\n"+
		"Will you shog off? I would have you solus.\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"'Solus,' egregious dog? O viper vile!\n"+
		"The 'solus' in thy most mervailous face;\n"+
		"The 'solus' in thy teeth, and in thy throat,\n"+
		"And in thy hateful lungs, yea, in thy maw, perdy,\n"+
		"And, which is worse, within thy nasty mouth!\n"+
		"I do retort the 'solus' in thy bowels;\n"+
		"For I can take, and Pistol's cock is up,\n"+
		"And flashing fire will follow.\n"+
		"NYM\n"+
		"I am not Barbason; you cannot conjure me. I have an\n"+
		"humour to knock you indifferently well. If you grow\n"+
		"foul with me, Pistol, I will scour you with my\n"+
		"rapier, as I may, in fair terms: if you would walk\n"+
		"off, I would prick your guts a little, in good\n"+
		"terms, as I may: and that's the humour of it.\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"O braggart vile and damned furious wight!\n"+
		"The grave doth gape, and doting death is near;\n"+
		"Therefore exhale.\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Hear me, hear me what I say: he that strikes the\n"+
		"first stroke, I'll run him up to the hilts, as I am a soldier.\n"+
		"Draws\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"An oath of mickle might; and fury shall abate.\n"+
		"Give me thy fist, thy fore-foot to me give:\n"+
		"Thy spirits are most tall.\n"+
		"NYM\n"+
		"I will cut thy throat, one time or other, in fair\n"+
		"terms: that is the humour of it.\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"'Couple a gorge!'\n"+
		"That is the word. I thee defy again.\n"+
		"O hound of Crete, think'st thou my spouse to get?\n"+
		"No; to the spital go,\n"+
		"And from the powdering tub of infamy\n"+
		"Fetch forth the lazar kite of Cressid's kind,\n"+
		"Doll Tearsheet she by name, and her espouse:\n"+
		"I have, and I will hold, the quondam Quickly\n"+
		"For the only she; and--pauca, there's enough. Go to.\n"+
		"Enter the Boy\n"+
		"Boy\n"+
		"Mine host Pistol, you must come to my master, and\n"+
		"you, hostess: he is very sick, and would to bed.\n"+
		"Good Bardolph, put thy face between his sheets, and\n"+
		"do the office of a warming-pan. Faith, he's very ill.\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Away, you rogue!\n"+
		"Hostess\n"+
		"By my troth, he'll yield the crow a pudding one of\n"+
		"these days. The king has killed his heart. Good\n"+
		"husband, come home presently.\n"+
		"Exeunt Hostess and Boy\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Come, shall I make you two friends? We must to\n"+
		"France together: why the devil should we keep\n"+
		"knives to cut one another's throats?\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"Let floods o'erswell, and fiends for food howl on!\n"+
		"NYM\n"+
		"You'll pay me the eight shillings I won of you at betting?\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"Base is the slave that pays.\n"+
		"NYM\n"+
		"That now I will have: that's the humour of it.\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"As manhood shall compound: push home.\n"+
		"They draw\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"By this sword, he that makes the first thrust, I'll\n"+
		"kill him; by this sword, I will.\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"Sword is an oath, and oaths must have their course.\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Corporal Nym, an thou wilt be friends, be friends:\n"+
		"an thou wilt not, why, then, be enemies with me too.\n"+
		"Prithee, put up.\n"+
		"NYM\n"+
		"I shall have my eight shillings I won of you at betting?\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"A noble shalt thou have, and present pay;\n"+
		"And liquor likewise will I give to thee,\n"+
		"And friendship shall combine, and brotherhood:\n"+
		"I'll live by Nym, and Nym shall live by me;\n"+
		"Is not this just? for I shall sutler be\n"+
		"Unto the camp, and profits will accrue.\n"+
		"Give me thy hand.\n"+
		"NYM\n"+
		"I shall have my noble?\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"In cash most justly paid.\n"+
		"NYM\n"+
		"Well, then, that's the humour of't.\n"+
		"Re-enter Hostess\n"+
		"Hostess\n"+
		"As ever you came of women, come in quickly to Sir\n"+
		"John. Ah, poor heart! he is so shaked of a burning\n"+
		"quotidian tertian, that it is most lamentable to\n"+
		"behold. Sweet men, come to him.\n"+
		"NYM\n"+
		"The king hath run bad humours on the knight; that's\n"+
		"the even of it.\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"Nym, thou hast spoke the right;\n"+
		"His heart is fracted and corroborate.\n"+
		"NYM\n"+
		"The king is a good king: but it must be as it may;\n"+
		"he passes some humours and careers.\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"Let us condole the knight; for, lambkins we will live.\n"+
		"SCENE II. Southampton. A council-chamber.\n"+
		"Enter EXETER, BEDFORD, and WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"BEDFORD\n"+
		"'Fore God, his grace is bold, to trust these traitors.\n"+
		"EXETER\n"+
		"They shall be apprehended by and by.\n"+
		"WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"How smooth and even they do bear themselves!\n"+
		"As if allegiance in their bosoms sat,\n"+
		"Crowned with faith and constant loyalty.\n"+
		"BEDFORD\n"+
		"The king hath note of all that they intend,\n"+
		"By interception which they dream not of.\n"+
		"EXETER\n"+
		"Nay, but the man that was his bedfellow,\n"+
		"Whom he hath dull'd and cloy'd with gracious favours,\n"+
		"That he should, for a foreign purse, so sell\n"+
		"His sovereign's life to death and treachery.\n"+
		"Trumpets sound. Enter KING HENRY V, SCROOP, CAMBRIDGE, GREY, and Attendants\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Now sits the wind fair, and we will aboard.\n"+
		"My Lord of Cambridge, and my kind Lord of Masham,\n"+
		"And you, my gentle knight, give me your thoughts:\n"+
		"Think you not that the powers we bear with us\n"+
		"Will cut their passage through the force of France,\n"+
		"Doing the execution and the act\n"+
		"For which we have in head assembled them?\n"+
		"SCROOP\n"+
		"No doubt, my liege, if each man do his best.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"I doubt not that; since we are well persuaded\n"+
		"We carry not a heart with us from hence\n"+
		"That grows not in a fair consent with ours,\n"+
		"Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish\n"+
		"Success and conquest to attend on us.\n"+
		"CAMBRIDGE\n"+
		"Never was monarch better fear'd and loved\n"+
		"Than is your majesty: there's not, I think, a subject\n"+
		"That sits in heart-grief and uneasiness\n"+
		"Under the sweet shade of your government.\n"+
		"GREY\n"+
		"True: those that were your father's enemies\n"+
		"Have steep'd their galls in honey and do serve you\n"+
		"With hearts create of duty and of zeal.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"We therefore have great cause of thankfulness;\n"+
		"And shall forget the office of our hand,\n"+
		"Sooner than quittance of desert and merit\n"+
		"According to the weight and worthiness.\n"+
		"SCROOP\n"+
		"So service shall with steeled sinews toil,\n"+
		"And labour shall refresh itself with hope,\n"+
		"To do your grace incessant services.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"We judge no less. Uncle of Exeter,\n"+
		"Enlarge the man committed yesterday,\n"+
		"That rail'd against our person: we consider\n"+
		"it was excess of wine that set him on;\n"+
		"And on his more advice we pardon him.\n"+
		"SCROOP\n"+
		"That's mercy, but too much security:\n"+
		"Let him be punish'd, sovereign, lest example\n"+
		"Breed, by his sufferance, more of such a kind.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"O, let us yet be merciful.\n"+
		"CAMBRIDGE\n"+
		"So may your highness, and yet punish too.\n"+
		"GREY\n"+
		"Sir,\n"+
		"You show great mercy, if you give him life,\n"+
		"After the taste of much correction.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Alas, your too much love and care of me\n"+
		"Are heavy orisons 'gainst this poor wretch!\n"+
		"If little faults, proceeding on distemper,\n"+
		"Shall not be wink'd at, how shall we stretch our eye\n"+
		"When capital crimes, chew'd, swallow'd and digested,\n"+
		"Appear before us? We'll yet enlarge that man,\n"+
		"Though Cambridge, Scroop and Grey, in their dear care\n"+
		"And tender preservation of our person,\n"+
		"Would have him punished. And now to our French causes:\n"+
		"Who are the late commissioners?\n"+
		"CAMBRIDGE\n"+
		"I one, my lord:\n"+
		"Your highness bade me ask for it to-day.\n"+
		"SCROOP\n"+
		"So did you me, my liege.\n"+
		"GREY\n"+
		"And I, my royal sovereign.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Then, Richard Earl of Cambridge, there is yours;\n"+
		"There yours, Lord Scroop of Masham; and, sir knight,\n"+
		"Grey of Northumberland, this same is yours:\n"+
		"Read them; and know, I know your worthiness.\n"+
		"My Lord of Westmoreland, and uncle Exeter,\n"+
		"We will aboard to night. Why, how now, gentlemen!\n"+
		"What see you in those papers that you lose\n"+
		"So much complexion? Look ye, how they change!\n"+
		"Their cheeks are paper. Why, what read you there\n"+
		"That hath so cowarded and chased your blood\n"+
		"Out of appearance?\n"+
		"CAMBRIDGE\n"+
		"I do confess my fault;\n"+
		"And do submit me to your highness' mercy.\n"+
		"GREY\n"+
		"SCROOP\n"+
		"To which we all appeal.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"The mercy that was quick in us but late,\n"+
		"By your own counsel is suppress'd and kill'd:\n"+
		"You must not dare, for shame, to talk of mercy;\n"+
		"For your own reasons turn into your bosoms,\n"+
		"As dogs upon their masters, worrying you.\n"+
		"See you, my princes, and my noble peers,\n"+
		"These English monsters! My Lord of Cambridge here,\n"+
		"You know how apt our love was to accord\n"+
		"To furnish him with all appertinents\n"+
		"Belonging to his honour; and this man\n"+
		"Hath, for a few light crowns, lightly conspired,\n"+
		"And sworn unto the practises of France,\n"+
		"To kill us here in Hampton: to the which\n"+
		"This knight, no less for bounty bound to us\n"+
		"Than Cambridge is, hath likewise sworn. But, O,\n"+
		"What shall I say to thee, Lord Scroop? thou cruel,\n"+
		"Ingrateful, savage and inhuman creature!\n"+
		"Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels,\n"+
		"That knew'st the very bottom of my soul,\n"+
		"That almost mightst have coin'd me into gold,\n"+
		"Wouldst thou have practised on me for thy use,\n"+
		"May it be possible, that foreign hire\n"+
		"Could out of thee extract one spark of evil\n"+
		"That might annoy my finger? 'tis so strange,\n"+
		"That, though the truth of it stands off as gross\n"+
		"As black and white, my eye will scarcely see it.\n"+
		"Treason and murder ever kept together,\n"+
		"As two yoke-devils sworn to either's purpose,\n"+
		"Working so grossly in a natural cause,\n"+
		"That admiration did not whoop at them:\n"+
		"But thou, 'gainst all proportion, didst bring in\n"+
		"Wonder to wait on treason and on murder:\n"+
		"And whatsoever cunning fiend it was\n"+
		"That wrought upon thee so preposterously\n"+
		"Hath got the voice in hell for excellence:\n"+
		"All other devils that suggest by treasons\n"+
		"Do botch and bungle up damnation\n"+
		"With patches, colours, and with forms being fetch'd\n"+
		"From glistering semblances of piety;\n"+
		"But he that temper'd thee bade thee stand up,\n"+
		"Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason,\n"+
		"Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor.\n"+
		"If that same demon that hath gull'd thee thus\n"+
		"Should with his lion gait walk the whole world,\n"+
		"He might return to vasty Tartar back,\n"+
		"And tell the legions 'I can never win\n"+
		"A soul so easy as that Englishman's.'\n"+
		"O, how hast thou with 'jealousy infected\n"+
		"The sweetness of affiance! Show men dutiful?\n"+
		"Why, so didst thou: seem they grave and learned?\n"+
		"Why, so didst thou: come they of noble family?\n"+
		"Why, so didst thou: seem they religious?\n"+
		"Why, so didst thou: or are they spare in diet,\n"+
		"Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger,\n"+
		"Constant in spirit, not swerving with the blood,\n"+
		"Garnish'd and deck'd in modest complement,\n"+
		"Not working with the eye without the ear,\n"+
		"And but in purged judgment trusting neither?\n"+
		"Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem:\n"+
		"And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot,\n"+
		"To mark the full-fraught man and best indued\n"+
		"With some suspicion. I will weep for thee;\n"+
		"For this revolt of thine, methinks, is like\n"+
		"Another fall of man. Their faults are open:\n"+
		"Arrest them to the answer of the law;\n"+
		"And God acquit them of their practises!\n"+
		"EXETER\n"+
		"I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of\n"+
		"Richard Earl of Cambridge.\n"+
		"I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of\n"+
		"Henry Lord Scroop of Masham.\n"+
		"I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of\n"+
		"Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland.\n"+
		"SCROOP\n"+
		"Our purposes God justly hath discover'd;\n"+
		"And I repent my fault more than my death;\n"+
		"Which I beseech your highness to forgive,\n"+
		"Although my body pay the price of it.\n"+
		"CAMBRIDGE\n"+
		"For me, the gold of France did not seduce;\n"+
		"Although I did admit it as a motive\n"+
		"The sooner to effect what I intended:\n"+
		"But God be thanked for prevention;\n"+
		"Which I in sufferance heartily will rejoice,\n"+
		"Beseeching God and you to pardon me.\n"+
		"GREY\n"+
		"Never did faithful subject more rejoice\n"+
		"At the discovery of most dangerous treason\n"+
		"Than I do at this hour joy o'er myself.\n"+
		"Prevented from a damned enterprise:\n"+
		"My fault, but not my body, pardon, sovereign.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"God quit you in his mercy! Hear your sentence.\n"+
		"You have conspired against our royal person,\n"+
		"Join'd with an enemy proclaim'd and from his coffers\n"+
		"Received the golden earnest of our death;\n"+
		"Wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter,\n"+
		"His princes and his peers to servitude,\n"+
		"His subjects to oppression and contempt\n"+
		"And his whole kingdom into desolation.\n"+
		"Touching our person seek we no revenge;\n"+
		"But we our kingdom's safety must so tender,\n"+
		"Whose ruin you have sought, that to her laws\n"+
		"We do deliver you. Get you therefore hence,\n"+
		"Poor miserable wretches, to your death:\n"+
		"The taste whereof, God of his mercy give\n"+
		"You patience to endure, and true repentance\n"+
		"Of all your dear offences! Bear them hence.\n"+
		"Exeunt CAMBRIDGE, SCROOP and GREY, guarded\n"+
		"Now, lords, for France; the enterprise whereof\n"+
		"Shall be to you, as us, like glorious.\n"+
		"We doubt not of a fair and lucky war,\n"+
		"Since God so graciously hath brought to light\n"+
		"This dangerous treason lurking in our way\n"+
		"To hinder our beginnings. We doubt not now\n"+
		"But every rub is smoothed on our way.\n"+
		"Then forth, dear countrymen: let us deliver\n"+
		"Our puissance into the hand of God,\n"+
		"Putting it straight in expedition.\n"+
		"Cheerly to sea; the signs of war advance:\n"+
		"No king of England, if not king of France.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. London. Before a tavern.\n"+
		"Enter PISTOL, Hostess, NYM, BARDOLPH, and Boy\n"+
		"Hostess\n"+
		"Prithee, honey-sweet husband, let me bring thee to Staines.\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"No; for my manly heart doth yearn.\n"+
		"Bardolph, be blithe: Nym, rouse thy vaunting veins:\n"+
		"Boy, bristle thy courage up; for Falstaff he is dead,\n"+
		"And we must yearn therefore.\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Would I were with him, wheresome'er he is, either in\n"+
		"heaven or in hell!\n"+
		"Hostess\n"+
		"Nay, sure, he's not in hell: he's in Arthur's\n"+
		"bosom, if ever man went to Arthur's bosom. A' made\n"+
		"a finer end and went away an it had been any\n"+
		"christom child; a' parted even just between twelve\n"+
		"and one, even at the turning o' the tide: for after\n"+
		"I saw him fumble with the sheets and play with\n"+
		"flowers and smile upon his fingers' ends, I knew\n"+
		"there was but one way; for his nose was as sharp as\n"+
		"a pen, and a' babbled of green fields. 'How now,\n"+
		"sir John!' quoth I 'what, man! be o' good\n"+
		"cheer.' So a' cried out 'God, God, God!' three or\n"+
		"four times. Now I, to comfort him, bid him a'\n"+
		"should not think of God; I hoped there was no need\n"+
		"to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet. So\n"+
		"a' bade me lay more clothes on his feet: I put my\n"+
		"hand into the bed and felt them, and they were as\n"+
		"cold as any stone; then I felt to his knees, and\n"+
		"they were as cold as any stone, and so upward and\n"+
		"upward, and all was as cold as any stone.\n"+
		"NYM\n"+
		"They say he cried out of sack.\n"+
		"Hostess\n"+
		"Ay, that a' did.\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"And of women.\n"+
		"Hostess\n"+
		"Nay, that a' did not.\n"+
		"Boy\n"+
		"Yes, that a' did; and said they were devils\n"+
		"incarnate.\n"+
		"Hostess\n"+
		"A' could never abide carnation; 'twas a colour he\n"+
		"never liked.\n"+
		"Boy\n"+
		"A' said once, the devil would have him about women.\n"+
		"Hostess\n"+
		"A' did in some sort, indeed, handle women; but then\n"+
		"he was rheumatic, and talked of the whore of Babylon.\n"+
		"Boy\n"+
		"Do you not remember, a' saw a flea stick upon\n"+
		"Bardolph's nose, and a' said it was a black soul\n"+
		"burning in hell-fire?\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Well, the fuel is gone that maintained that fire:\n"+
		"that's all the riches I got in his service.\n"+
		"NYM\n"+
		"Shall we shog? the king will be gone from\n"+
		"Southampton.\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"Come, let's away. My love, give me thy lips.\n"+
		"Look to my chattels and my movables:\n"+
		"Let senses rule; the word is 'Pitch and Pay:'\n"+
		"Trust none;\n"+
		"For oaths are straws, men's faiths are wafer-cakes,\n"+
		"And hold-fast is the only dog, my duck:\n"+
		"Therefore, Caveto be thy counsellor.\n"+
		"Go, clear thy c rystals. Yoke-fellows in arms,\n"+
		"Let us to France; like horse-leeches, my boys,\n"+
		"To suck, to suck, the very blood to suck!\n"+
		"Boy\n"+
		"And that's but unwholesome food they say.\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"Touch her soft mouth, and march.\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Farewell, hostess.\n"+
		"Kissing her\n"+
		"NYM\n"+
		"I cannot kiss, that is the humour of it; but, adieu.\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"Let housewifery appear: keep close, I thee command.\n"+
		"Hostess\n"+
		"Farewell; adieu.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV. France. The KING'S palace.\n"+
		"Flourish. Enter the FRENCH KING, the DAUPHIN, the DUKES of BERRI and BRETAGNE, the Constable, and others\n"+
		"KING OF FRANCE\n"+
		"Thus comes the English with full power upon us;\n"+
		"And more than carefully it us concerns\n"+
		"To answer royally in our defences.\n"+
		"Therefore the Dukes of Berri and of Bretagne,\n"+
		"Of Brabant and of Orleans, shall make forth,\n"+
		"And you, Prince Dauphin, with all swift dispatch,\n"+
		"To line and new repair our towns of war\n"+
		"With men of courage and with means defendant;\n"+
		"For England his approaches makes as fierce\n"+
		"As waters to the sucking of a gulf.\n"+
		"It fits us then to be as provident\n"+

		"Though war nor no known quarrel were in question,\n"+
		"But that defences, musters, preparations,\n"+
		"Should be maintain'd, assembled and collected,\n"+
		"As were a war in expectation.\n"+
		"Therefore, I say 'tis meet we all go forth\n"+
		"To view the sick and feeble parts of France:\n"+
		"And let us do it with no show of fear;\n"+
		"No, with no more than if we heard that England\n"+
		"Were busied with a Whitsun morris-dance:\n"+
		"For, my good liege, she is so idly king'd,\n"+
		"Her sceptre so fantastically borne\n"+
		"By a vain, giddy, shallow, humorous youth,\n"+
		"That fear attends her not.\n"+
		"Constable\n"+
		"O peace, Prince Dauphin!\n"+
		"You are too much mistaken in this king:\n"+
		"Question your grace the late ambassadors,\n"+
		"With what great state he heard their embassy,\n"+
		"How well supplied with noble counsellors,\n"+
		"How modest in exception, and withal\n"+
		"How terrible in constant resolution,\n"+
		"And you shall find his vanities forespent\n"+
		"Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus,\n"+
		"Covering discretion with a coat of folly;\n"+
		"As gardeners do with ordure hide those roots\n"+
		"That shall first spring and be most delicate.\n"+
		"DAUPHIN\n"+
		"Well, 'tis not so, my lord high constable;\n"+
		"But though we think it so, it is no matter:\n"+
		"In cases of defence 'tis best to weigh\n"+
		"The enemy more mighty than he seems:\n"+
		"So the proportions of defence are fill'd;\n"+
		"Which of a weak or niggardly projection\n"+
		"Doth, like a miser, spoil his coat with scanting\n"+
		"A little cloth.\n"+
		"KING OF FRANCE\n"+
		"Think we King Harry strong;\n"+
		"And, princes, look you strongly arm to meet him.\n"+
		"The kindred of him hath been flesh'd upon us;\n"+
		"And he is bred out of that bloody strain\n"+
		"That haunted us in our familiar paths:\n"+
		"Witness our too much memorable shame\n"+
		"When Cressy battle fatally was struck,\n"+
		"And all our princes captiv'd by the hand\n"+
		"Of that black name, Edward, Black Prince of Wales;\n"+
		"Whiles that his mountain sire, on mountain standing,\n"+
		"Up in the air, crown'd with the golden sun,\n"+
		"Saw his heroical seed, and smiled to see him,\n"+
		"Mangle the work of nature and deface\n"+
		"The patterns that by God and by French fathers\n"+
		"Had twenty years been made. This is a stem\n"+
		"Of that victorious stock; and let us fear\n"+
		"The native mightiness and fate of him.\n"+
		"Enter a Messenger\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Ambassadors from Harry King of England\n"+
		"Do crave admittance to your majesty.\n"+
		"KING OF FRANCE\n"+
		"We'll give them present audience. Go, and bring them.\n"+
		"Exeunt Messenger and certain Lords\n"+
		"You see this chase is hotly follow'd, friends.\n"+
		"DAUPHIN\n"+
		"Turn head, and stop pursuit; for coward dogs\n"+
		"Most spend their mouths when what they seem to threaten\n"+
		"Runs far before them. Good my sovereign,\n"+
		"Take up the English short, and let them know\n"+
		"Of what a monarchy you are the head:\n"+
		"Self-love, my liege, is not so vile a sin\n"+
		"As self-neglecting.\n"+
		"Re-enter Lords, with EXETER and train\n"+
		"KING OF FRANCE\n"+
		"From our brother England?\n"+
		"EXETER\n"+
		"From him; and thus he greets your majesty.\n"+
		"He wills you, in the name of God Almighty,\n"+
		"That you divest yourself, and lay apart\n"+
		"The borrow'd glories that by gift of heaven,\n"+
		"By law of nature and of nations, 'long\n"+
		"To him and to his heirs; namely, the crown\n"+
		"And all wide-stretched honours that pertain\n"+
		"By custom and the ordinance of times\n"+
		"Unto the crown of France. That you may know\n"+
		"'Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim,\n"+
		"Pick'd from the worm-holes of long-vanish'd days,\n"+
		"Nor from the dust of old oblivion raked,\n"+
		"He sends you this most memorable line,\n"+
		"In every branch truly demonstrative;\n"+
		"Willing to overlook this pedigree:\n"+
		"And when you find him evenly derived\n"+
		"From his most famed of famous ancestors,\n"+
		"Edward the Third, he bids you then resign\n"+
		"Your crown and kingdom, indirectly held\n"+
		"From him the native and true challenger.\n"+
		"KING OF FRANCE\n"+
		"Or else what follows?\n"+
		"EXETER\n"+
		"Bloody constraint; for if you hide the crown\n"+
		"Even in your hearts, there will he rake for it:\n"+
		"Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming,\n"+
		"In thunder and in earthquake, like a Jove,\n"+
		"That, if requiring fail, he will compel;\n"+
		"And bids you, in the bowels of the Lord,\n"+
		"Deliver up the crown, and to take mercy\n"+
		"On the poor souls for whom this hungry war\n"+
		"Opens his vasty jaws; and on your head\n"+
		"Turning the widows' tears, the orphans' cries\n"+
		"The dead men's blood, the pining maidens groans,\n"+
		"For husbands, fathers and betrothed lovers,\n"+
		"That shall be swallow'd in this controversy.\n"+
		"This is his claim, his threatening and my message;\n"+
		"Unless the Dauphin be in presence here,\n"+
		"To whom expressly I bring greeting too.\n"+
		"KING OF FRANCE\n"+
		"For us, we will consider of this further:\n"+
		"To-morrow shall you bear our full intent\n"+
		"Back to our brother England.\n"+
		"DAUPHIN\n"+
		"For the Dauphin,\n"+
		"I stand here for him: what to him from England?\n"+
		"EXETER\n"+
		"Scorn and defiance; slight regard, contempt,\n"+
		"And any thing that may not misbecome\n"+
		"The mighty sender, doth he prize you at.\n"+
		"Thus says my king; an' if your father's highness\n"+
		"Do not, in grant of all demands at large,\n"+
		"Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his majesty,\n"+
		"He'll call you to so hot an answer of it,\n"+
		"That caves and womby vaultages of France\n"+
		"Shall chide your trespass and return your mock\n"+
		"In second accent of his ordnance.\n"+
		"DAUPHIN\n"+
		"Say, if my father render fair return,\n"+
		"It is against my will; for I desire\n"+
		"Nothing but odds with England: to that end,\n"+
		"As matching to his youth and vanity,\n"+
		"I did present him with the Paris balls.\n"+
		"EXETER\n"+
		"He'll make your Paris Louvre shake for it,\n"+
		"Were it the mistress-court of mighty Europe:\n"+
		"And, be assured, you'll find a difference,\n"+
		"As we his subjects have in wonder found,\n"+
		"Between the promise of his greener days\n"+
		"And these he masters now: now he weighs time\n"+
		"Even to the utmost grain: that you shall read\n"+
		"In your own losses, if he stay in France.\n"+
		"KING OF FRANCE\n"+
		"To-morrow shall you know our mind at full.\n"+
		"EXETER\n"+
		"Dispatch us with all speed, lest that our king\n"+
		"Come here himself to question our delay;\n"+
		"For he is footed in this land already.\n"+
		"KING OF FRANCE\n"+
		"You shall be soon dispatch's with fair conditions:\n"+
		"A night is but small breath and little pause\n"+
		"To answer matters of this consequence.\n"+
		"Flourish. Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT III\n"+
		"PROLOGUE\n"+
		"Enter Chorus\n"+
		"Chorus\n"+
		"Thus with imagined wing our swift scene flies\n"+
		"In motion of no less celerity\n"+
		"Than that of thought. Suppose that you have seen\n"+
		"The well-appointed king at Hampton pier\n"+
		"Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet\n"+
		"With silken streamers the young Phoebus fanning:\n"+
		"Play with your fancies, and in them behold\n"+
		"Upon the hempen tackle ship-boys climbing;\n"+
		"Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give\n"+
		"To sounds confused; behold the threaden sails,\n"+
		"Borne with the invisible and creeping wind,\n"+
		"Draw the huge bottoms through the furrow'd sea,\n"+
		"Breasting the lofty surge: O, do but think\n"+
		"You stand upon the ravage and behold\n"+
		"A city on the inconstant billows dancing;\n"+
		"For so appears this fleet majestical,\n"+
		"Holding due course to Harfleur. Follow, follow:\n"+
		"Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy,\n"+
		"And leave your England, as dead midnight still,\n"+
		"Guarded with grandsires, babies and old women,\n"+
		"Either past or not arrived to pith and puissance;\n"+
		"For who is he, whose chin is but enrich'd\n"+
		"With one appearing hair, that will not follow\n"+
		"These cull'd and choice-drawn cavaliers to France?\n"+
		"Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege;\n"+
		"Behold the ordnance on their carriages,\n"+
		"With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur.\n"+
		"Suppose the ambassador from the French comes back;\n"+
		"Tells Harry that the king doth offer him\n"+
		"Katharine his daughter, and with her, to dowry,\n"+
		"Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms.\n"+
		"The offer likes not: and the nimble gunner\n"+
		"With linstock now the devilish cannon touches,\n"+
		"Alarum, and chambers go off\n"+
		"And down goes all before them. Still be kind,\n"+
		"And eke out our performance with your mind.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE I. France. Before Harfleur.\n"+
		"Alarum. Enter KING HENRY, EXETER, BEDFORD, GLOUCESTER, and Soldiers, with scaling-ladders\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;\n"+
		"Or close the wall up with our English dead.\n"+
		"In peace there's nothing so becomes a man\n"+
		"As modest stillness and humility:\n"+
		"But when the blast of war blows in our ears,\n"+
		"Then imitate the action of the tiger;\n"+
		"Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,\n"+
		"Disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage;\n"+
		"Then lend the eye a terrible aspect;\n"+
		"Let pry through the portage of the head\n"+
		"Like the brass cannon; let the brow o'erwhelm it\n"+
		"As fearfully as doth a galled rock\n"+
		"O'erhang and jutty his confounded base,\n"+
		"Swill'd with the wild and wasteful ocean.\n"+
		"Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide,\n"+
		"Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit\n"+
		"To his full height. On, on, you noblest English.\n"+
		"Whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof!\n"+
		"Fathers that, like so many Alexanders,\n"+
		"Have in these parts from morn till even fought\n"+
		"And sheathed their swords for lack of argument:\n"+
		"Dishonour not your mothers; now attest\n"+
		"That those whom you call'd fathers did beget you.\n"+
		"Be copy now to men of grosser blood,\n"+
		"And teach them how to war. And you, good yeoman,\n"+
		"Whose limbs were made in England, show us here\n"+
		"The mettle of your pasture; let us swear\n"+
		"That you are worth your breeding; which I doubt not;\n"+
		"For there is none of you so mean and base,\n"+
		"That hath not noble lustre in your eyes.\n"+
		"I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,\n"+
		"Straining upon the start. The game's afoot:\n"+
		"Follow your spirit, and upon this charge\n"+
		"Cry 'God for Harry, England, and Saint George!'\n"+
		"Exeunt. Alarum, and chambers go off\n"+
		"SCENE II. The same.\n"+
		"Enter NYM, BARDOLPH, PISTOL, and Boy\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"On, on, on, on, on! to the breach, to the breach!\n"+
		"NYM\n"+
		"Pray thee, corporal, stay: the knocks are too hot;\n"+
		"and, for mine own part, I have not a case of lives:\n"+
		"the humour of it is too hot, that is the very\n"+
		"plain-song of it.\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"The plain-song is most just: for humours do abound:\n"+
		"Knocks go and come; God's vassals drop and die;\n"+
		"And sword and shield,\n"+
		"In bloody field,\n"+
		"Doth win immortal fame.\n"+
		"Boy\n"+
		"Would I were in an alehouse in London! I would give\n"+
		"all my fame for a pot of ale and safety.\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"And I:\n"+
		"If wishes would prevail with me,\n"+
		"My purpose should not fail with me,\n"+
		"But thither would I hie.\n"+
		"Boy\n"+
		"As duly, but not as truly,\n"+
		"As bird doth sing on bough.\n"+
		"Enter FLUELLEN\n"+
		"FLUELLEN\n"+
		"Up to the breach, you dogs! avaunt, you cullions!\n"+
		"Driving them forward\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"Be merciful, great duke, to men of mould.\n"+
		"Abate thy rage, abate thy manly rage,\n"+
		"Abate thy rage, great duke!\n"+
		"Good bawcock, bate thy rage; use lenity, sweet chuck!\n"+
		"NYM\n"+
		"These be good humours! your honour wins bad humours.\n"+
		"Exeunt all but Boy\n"+
		"Boy\n"+
		"As young as I am, I have observed these three\n"+
		"swashers. I am boy to them all three: but all they\n"+
		"three, though they would serve me, could not be man\n"+
		"to me; for indeed three such antics do not amount to\n"+
		"a man. For Bardolph, he is white-livered and\n"+
		"red-faced; by the means whereof a' faces it out, but\n"+
		"fights not. For Pistol, he hath a killing tongue\n"+
		"and a quiet sword; by the means whereof a' breaks\n"+
		"words, and keeps whole weapons. For Nym, he hath\n"+
		"heard that men of few words are the best men; and\n"+
		"therefore he scorns to say his prayers, lest a'\n"+
		"should be thought a coward: but his few bad words\n"+
		"are matched with as few good deeds; for a' never\n"+
		"broke any man's head but his own, and that was\n"+
		"against a post when he was drunk. They will steal\n"+
		"any thing, and call it purchase. Bardolph stole a\n"+
		"lute-case, bore it twelve leagues, and sold it for\n"+
		"three half pence. Nym and Bardolph are sworn\n"+
		"brothers in filching, and in Calais they stole a\n"+
		"fire-shovel: I knew by that piece of service the\n"+
		"men would carry coals. They would have me as\n"+
		"familiar with men's pockets as their gloves or their\n"+
		"handkerchers: which makes much against my manhood,\n"+
		"if I should take from another's pocket to put into\n"+
		"mine; for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs. I\n"+
		"must leave them, and seek some better service:\n"+
		"their villany goes against my weak stomach, and\n"+
		"therefore I must cast it up.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"Re-enter FLUELLEN, GOWER following\n"+
		"GOWER\n"+
		"Captain Fluellen, you must come presently to the\n"+
		"mines; the Duke of Gloucester would speak with you.\n"+
		"FLUELLEN\n"+
		"To the mines! tell you the duke, it is not so good\n"+
		"to come to the mines; for, look you, the mines is\n"+
		"not according to the disciplines of the war: the\n"+
		"concavities of it is not sufficient; for, look you,\n"+
		"the athversary, you may discuss unto the duke, look\n"+
		"you, is digt himself four yard under the\n"+
		"countermines: by Cheshu, I think a' will plough up\n"+
		"all, if there is not better directions.\n"+
		"GOWER\n"+
		"The Duke of Gloucester, to whom the order of the\n"+
		"siege is given, is altogether directed by an\n"+
		"Irishman, a very valiant gentleman, i' faith.\n"+
		"FLUELLEN\n"+
		"It is Captain Macmorris, is it not?\n"+
		"GOWER\n"+
		"I think it be.\n"+
		"FLUELLEN\n"+
		"By Cheshu, he is an ass, as in the world: I will\n"+
		"verify as much in his beard: be has no more\n"+
		"directions in the true disciplines of the wars, look\n"+
		"you, of the Roman disciplines, than is a puppy-dog.\n"+
		"Enter MACMORRIS and Captain JAMY\n"+
		"GOWER\n"+
		"Here a' comes; and the Scots captain, Captain Jamy, with him.\n"+
		"FLUELLEN\n"+
		"Captain Jamy is a marvellous falourous gentleman,\n"+
		"that is certain; and of great expedition and\n"+
		"knowledge in th' aunchient wars, upon my particular\n"+
		"knowledge of his directions: by Cheshu, he will\n"+
		"maintain his argument as well as any military man in\n"+
		"the world, in the disciplines of the pristine wars\n"+
		"of the Romans.\n"+
		"JAMY\n"+
		"I say gud-day, Captain Fluellen.\n"+
		"FLUELLEN\n"+
		"God-den to your worship, good Captain James.\n"+
		"GOWER\n"+
		"How now, Captain Macmorris! have you quit the\n"+
		"mines? have the pioneers given o'er?\n"+
		"MACMORRIS\n"+
		"By Chrish, la! tish ill done: the work ish give\n"+
		"over, the trompet sound the retreat. By my hand, I\n"+
		"swear, and my father's soul, the work ish ill done;\n"+
		"it ish give over: I would have blowed up the town, so\n"+
		"Chrish save me, la! in an hour: O, tish ill done,\n"+
		"tish ill done; by my hand, tish ill done!\n"+
		"FLUELLEN\n"+
		"Captain Macmorris, I beseech you now, will you\n"+
		"voutsafe me, look you, a few disputations with you,\n"+
		"as partly touching or concerning the disciplines of\n"+
		"the war, the Roman wars, in the way of argument,\n"+
		"look you, and friendly communication; partly to\n"+
		"satisfy my opinion, and partly for the satisfaction,\n"+
		"look you, of my mind, as touching the direction of\n"+
		"the military discipline; that is the point.\n"+
		"JAMY\n"+
		"It sall be vary gud, gud feith, gud captains bath:\n"+
		"and I sall quit you with gud leve, as I may pick\n"+
		"occasion; that sall I, marry.\n"+
		"MACMORRIS\n"+
		"It is no time to discourse, so Chrish save me: the\n"+
		"day is hot, and the weather, and the wars, and the\n"+
		"king, and the dukes: it is no time to discourse. The\n"+
		"town is beseeched, and the trumpet call us to the\n"+
		"breach; and we talk, and, be Chrish, do nothing:\n"+
		"'tis shame for us all: so God sa' me, 'tis shame to\n"+
		"stand still; it is shame, by my hand: and there is\n"+
		"throats to be cut, and works to be done; and there\n"+
		"ish nothing done, so Chrish sa' me, la!\n"+
		"JAMY\n"+
		"By the mess, ere theise eyes of mine take themselves\n"+
		"to slomber, ay'll de gud service, or ay'll lig i'\n"+
		"the grund for it; ay, or go to death; and ay'll pay\n"+
		"'t as valourously as I may, that sall I suerly do,\n"+
		"that is the breff and the long. Marry, I wad full\n"+
		"fain hear some question 'tween you tway.\n"+
		"FLUELLEN\n"+
		"Captain Macmorris, I think, look you, under your\n"+
		"correction, there is not many of your nation--\n"+
		"MACMORRIS\n"+
		"Of my nation! What ish my nation? Ish a villain,\n"+
		"and a bastard, and a knave, and a rascal. What ish\n"+
		"my nation? Who talks of my nation?\n"+
		"FLUELLEN\n"+
		"Look you, if you take the matter otherwise than is\n"+
		"meant, Captain Macmorris, peradventure I shall think\n"+
		"you do not use me with that affability as in\n"+
		"discretion you ought to use me, look you: being as\n"+
		"good a man as yourself, both in the disciplines of\n"+
		"war, and in the derivation of my birth, and in\n"+
		"other particularities.\n"+
		"MACMORRIS\n"+
		"I do not know you so good a man as myself: so\n"+
		"Chrish save me, I will cut off your head.\n"+
		"GOWER\n"+
		"Gentlemen both, you will mistake each other.\n"+
		"JAMY\n"+
		"A! that's a foul fault.\n"+
		"A parley sounded\n"+
		"GOWER\n"+
		"The town sounds a parley.\n"+
		"FLUELLEN\n"+
		"Captain Macmorris, when there is more better\n"+
		"opportunity to be required, look you, I will be so\n"+
		"bold as to tell you I know the disciplines of war;\n"+
		"and there is an end.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. The same. Before the gates.\n"+
		"The Governor and some Citizens on the walls; the English forces below. Enter KING HENRY and his train\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"How yet resolves the governor of the town?\n"+
		"This is the latest parle we will admit;\n"+
		"Therefore to our best mercy give yourselves;\n"+
		"Or like to men proud of destruction\n"+
		"Defy us to our worst: for, as I am a soldier,\n"+
		"A name that in my thoughts becomes me best,\n"+
		"If I begin the battery once again,\n"+
		"I will not leave the half-achieved Harfleur\n"+
		"Till in her ashes she lie buried.\n"+
		"The gates of mercy shall be all shut up,\n"+
		"And the flesh'd soldier, rough and hard of heart,\n"+
		"In liberty of bloody hand shall range\n"+
		"With conscience wide as hell, mowing like grass\n"+
		"Your fresh-fair virgins and your flowering infants.\n"+
		"What is it then to me, if impious war,\n"+
		"Array'd in flames like to the prince of fiends,\n"+
		"Do, with his smirch'd complexion, all fell feats\n"+
		"Enlink'd to waste and desolation?\n"+
		"What is't to me, when you yourselves are cause,\n"+
		"If your pure maidens fall into the hand\n"+
		"Of hot and forcing violation?\n"+
		"What rein can hold licentious wickedness\n"+
		"When down the hill he holds his fierce career?\n"+
		"We may as bootless spend our vain command\n"+
		"Upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil\n"+
		"As send precepts to the leviathan\n"+
		"To come ashore. Therefore, you men of Harfleur,\n"+
		"Take pity of your town and of your people,\n"+
		"Whiles yet my soldiers are in my command;\n"+
		"Whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace\n"+
		"O'erblows the filthy and contagious clouds\n"+
		"Of heady murder, spoil and villany.\n"+
		"If not, why, in a moment look to see\n"+
		"The blind and bloody soldier with foul hand\n"+
		"Defile the locks of your shrill-shrieking daughters;\n"+
		"Your fathers taken by the silver beards,\n"+
		"And their most reverend heads dash'd to the walls,\n"+
		"Your naked infants spitted upon pikes,\n"+
		"Whiles the mad mothers with their howls confused\n"+
		"Do break the clouds, as did the wives of Jewry\n"+
		"At Herod's bloody-hunting slaughtermen.\n"+
		"What say you? will you yield, and this avoid,\n"+
		"Or, guilty in defence, be thus destroy'd?\n"+
		"GOVERNOR\n"+
		"Our expectation hath this day an end:\n"+
		"The Dauphin, whom of succors we entreated,\n"+
		"Returns us that his powers are yet not ready\n"+
		"To raise so great a siege. Therefore, great king,\n"+
		"We yield our town and lives to thy soft mercy.\n"+
		"Enter our gates; dispose of us and ours;\n"+
		"For we no longer are defensible.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Open your gates. Come, uncle Exeter,\n"+
		"Go you and enter Harfleur; there remain,\n"+
		"And fortify it strongly 'gainst the French:\n"+
		"Use mercy to them all. For us, dear uncle,\n"+
		"The winter coming on and sickness growing\n"+
		"Upon our soldiers, we will retire to Calais.\n"+
		"To-night in Harfleur we will be your guest;\n"+
		"To-morrow for the march are we addrest.\n"+
		"Flourish. The King and his train enter the town\n"+
		"SCENE IV. The FRENCH KING's palace.\n"+
		"Enter KATHARINE and ALICE\n"+
		"KATHARINE\n"+
		"Alice, tu as ete en Angleterre, et tu parles bien le langage.\n"+
		"ALICE\n"+
		"Un peu, madame.\n"+
		"KATHARINE\n"+
		"Je te prie, m'enseignez: il faut que j'apprenne a\n"+
		"parler. Comment appelez-vous la main en Anglois?\n"+
		"ALICE\n"+
		"La main? elle est appelee de hand.\n"+
		"KATHARINE\n"+
		"De hand. Et les doigts?\n"+
		"ALICE\n"+
		"Les doigts? ma foi, j'oublie les doigts; mais je me\n"+
		"souviendrai. Les doigts? je pense qu'ils sont\n"+
		"appeles de fingres; oui, de fingres.\n"+
		"KATHARINE\n"+
		"La main, de hand; les doigts, de fingres. Je pense\n"+
		"que je suis le bon ecolier; j'ai gagne deux mots\n"+
		"d'Anglois vitement. Comment appelez-vous les ongles?\n"+
		"ALICE\n"+
		"Les ongles? nous les appelons de nails.\n"+
		"KATHARINE\n"+
		"De nails. Ecoutez; dites-moi, si je parle bien: de\n"+
		"hand, de fingres, et de nails.\n"+
		"ALICE\n"+
		"C'est bien dit, madame; il est fort bon Anglois.\n"+
		"KATHARINE\n"+
		"Dites-moi l'Anglois pour le bras.\n"+
		"ALICE\n"+
		"De arm, madame.\n"+
		"KATHARINE\n"+
		"Et le coude?\n"+
		"ALICE\n"+
		"De elbow.\n"+
		"KATHARINE\n"+
		"De elbow. Je m'en fais la repetition de tous les\n"+
		"mots que vous m'avez appris des a present.\n"+
		"ALICE\n"+

		"KING OF FRANCE\n"+
		"'Tis certain he hath pass'd the river Somme.\n"+
		"Constable\n"+
		"And if he be not fought withal, my lord,\n"+
		"Let us not live in France; let us quit all\n"+
		"And give our vineyards to a barbarous people.\n"+
		"DAUPHIN\n"+
		"O Dieu vivant! shall a few sprays of us,\n"+
		"The emptying of our fathers' luxury,\n"+
		"Our scions, put in wild and savage stock,\n"+
		"Spirt up so suddenly into the clouds,\n"+
		"And overlook their grafters?\n"+
		"BOURBON\n"+
		"Normans, but bastard Normans, Norman bastards!\n"+
		"Mort de ma vie! if they march along\n"+
		"Unfought withal, but I will sell my dukedom,\n"+
		"To buy a slobbery and a dirty farm\n"+
		"In that nook-shotten isle of Albion.\n"+
		"Constable\n"+
		"Dieu de batailles! where have they this mettle?\n"+
		"Is not their climate foggy, raw and dull,\n"+
		"On whom, as in despite, the sun looks pale,\n"+
		"Killing their fruit with frowns? Can sodden water,\n"+
		"A drench for sur-rein'd jades, their barley-broth,\n"+
		"Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat?\n"+
		"And shall our quick blood, spirited with wine,\n"+
		"Seem frosty? O, for honour of our land,\n"+
		"Let us not hang like roping icicles\n"+
		"Upon our houses' thatch, whiles a more frosty people\n"+
		"Sweat drops of gallant youth in our rich fields!\n"+
		"Poor we may call them in their native lords.\n"+
		"DAUPHIN\n"+
		"By faith and honour,\n"+
		"Our madams mock at us, and plainly say\n"+
		"Our mettle is bred out and they will give\n"+
		"Their bodies to the lust of English youth\n"+
		"To new-store France with bastard warriors.\n"+
		"BOURBON\n"+
		"They bid us to the English dancing-schools,\n"+
		"And teach lavoltas high and swift corantos;\n"+

		"And that we are most lofty runaways.\n"+
		"KING OF FRANCE\n"+
		"Where is Montjoy the herald? speed him hence:\n"+
		"Let him greet England with our sharp defiance.\n"+
		"Up, princes! and, with spirit of honour edged\n"+
		"More sharper than your swords, hie to the field:\n"+
		"Charles Delabreth, high constable of France;\n"+

		"For your great seats now quit you of great shames.\n"+
		"Bar Harry England, that sweeps through our land\n"+
		"With pennons painted in the blood of Harfleur:\n"+
		"Rush on his host, as doth the melted snow\n"+
		"Upon the valleys, whose low vassal seat\n"+
		"The Alps doth spit and void his rheum upon:\n"+
		"Go down upon him, you have power enough,\n"+
		"And in a captive chariot into Rouen\n"+

		"Constable\n"+
		"This becomes the great.\n"+
		"Sorry am I his numbers are so few,\n"+
		"His soldiers sick and famish'd in their march,\n"+
		"For I am sure, when he shall see our army,\n"+
		"He'll drop his heart into the sink of fear\n"+

		"KING OF FRANCE\n"+
		"Therefore, lord constable, haste on Montjoy.\n"+

		"DAUPHIN\n"+
		"Not so, I do beseech your majesty.\n"+

		"SCENE VI. The English camp in Picardy.\n"+
		"Enter GOWER and FLUELLEN, meeting\n"+
		"GOWER\n"+
		"How now, Captain Fluellen! come you from the bridge?\n"+
		"FLUELLEN\n"+
		"I assure you, there is very excellent services\n"+
		"committed at the bridge.\n"+
		"GOWER\n"+
		"Is the Duke of Exeter safe?\n"+
		"FLUELLEN\n"+
		"The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon;\n"+
		"and a man that I love and honour with my soul, and my\n"+
		"heart, and my duty, and my life, and my living, and\n"+
		"my uttermost power: he is not-God be praised and\n"+
		"blessed!--any hurt in the world; but keeps the\n"+
		"bridge most valiantly, with excellent discipline.\n"+
		"There is an aunchient lieutenant there at the\n"+
		"pridge, I think in my very conscience he is as\n"+
		"valiant a man as Mark Antony; and he is a man of no\n"+
		"estimation in the world; but did see him do as\n"+
		"gallant service.\n"+
		"GOWER\n"+
		"What do you call him?\n"+
		"FLUELLEN\n"+
		"He is called Aunchient Pistol.\n"+
		"GOWER\n"+
		"I know him not.\n"+
		"Enter PISTOL\n"+
		"FLUELLEN\n"+
		"Here is the man.\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"Captain, I thee beseech to do me favours:\n"+
		"The Duke of Exeter doth love thee well.\n"+
		"FLUELLEN\n"+
		"Ay, I praise God; and I have merited some love at\n"+
		"his hands.\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"Bardolph, a soldier, firm and sound of heart,\n"+
		"And of buxom valour, hath, by cruel fate,\n"+
		"And giddy Fortune's furious fickle wheel,\n"+
		"That goddess blind,\n"+
		"That stands upon the rolling restless stone--\n"+
		"FLUELLEN\n"+
		"By your patience, Aunchient Pistol. Fortune is\n"+
		"painted blind, with a muffler afore her eyes, to\n"+
		"signify to you that Fortune is blind; and she is\n"+
		"painted also with a wheel, to signify to you, which\n"+
		"is the moral of it, that she is turning, and\n"+
		"inconstant, and mutability, and variation: and her\n"+
		"foot, look you, is fixed upon a spherical stone,\n"+
		"which rolls, and rolls, and rolls: in good truth,\n"+
		"the poet makes a most excellent description of it:\n"+
		"Fortune is an excellent moral.\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"Fortune is Bardolph's foe, and frowns on him;\n"+
		"For he hath stolen a pax, and hanged must a' be:\n"+
		"A damned death!\n"+
		"Let gallows gape for dog; let man go free\n"+
		"And let not hemp his wind-pipe suffocate:\n"+
		"But Exeter hath given the doom of death\n"+
		"For pax of little price.\n"+
		"Therefore, go speak: the duke will hear thy voice:\n"+
		"And let not Bardolph's vital thread be cut\n"+
		"With edge of penny cord and vile reproach:\n"+
		"Speak, captain, for his life, and I will thee requite.\n"+
		"FLUELLEN\n"+
		"Aunchient Pistol, I do partly understand your meaning.\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"Why then, rejoice therefore.\n"+
		"FLUELLEN\n"+
		"Certainly, aunchient, it is not a thing to rejoice\n"+
		"at: for if, look you, he were my brother, I would\n"+
		"desire the duke to use his good pleasure, and put\n"+
		"him to execution; for discipline ought to be used.\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"Die and be damn'd! and figo for thy friendship!\n"+
		"FLUELLEN\n"+
		"It is well.\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"The fig of Spain!\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"FLUELLEN\n"+
		"Very good.\n"+
		"GOWER\n"+
		"Why, this is an arrant counterfeit rascal; I\n"+
		"remember him now; a bawd, a cutpurse.\n"+
		"FLUELLEN\n"+
		"I'll assure you, a' uttered as brave words at the\n"+
		"bridge as you shall see in a summer's day. But it\n"+
		"is very well; what he has spoke to me, that is well,\n"+
		"I warrant you, when time is serve.\n"+
		"GOWER\n"+
		"Why, 'tis a gull, a fool, a rogue, that now and then\n"+
		"goes to the wars, to grace himself at his return\n"+
		"into London under the form of a soldier. And such\n"+
		"fellows are perfect in the great commanders' names:\n"+
		"and they will learn you by rote where services were\n"+
		"done; at such and such a sconce, at such a breach,\n"+
		"at such a convoy; who came off bravely, who was\n"+
		"shot, who disgraced, what terms the enemy stood on;\n"+
		"and this they con perfectly in the phrase of war,\n"+
		"which they trick up with new-tuned oaths: and what\n"+
		"a beard of the general's cut and a horrid suit of\n"+
		"the camp will do among foaming bottles and\n"+
		"ale-washed wits, is wonderful to be thought on. But\n"+
		"you must learn to know such slanders of the age, or\n"+
		"else you may be marvellously mistook.\n"+
		"FLUELLEN\n"+
		"I tell you what, Captain Gower; I do perceive he is\n"+
		"not the man that he would gladly make show to the\n"+
		"world he is: if I find a hole in his coat, I will\n"+
		"tell him my mind.\n"+
		"Drum heard\n"+
		"Hark you, the king is coming, and I must speak with\n"+
		"him from the pridge.\n"+
		"Drum and colours. Enter KING HENRY, GLOUCESTER, and Soldiers\n"+
		"God pless your majesty!\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"How now, Fluellen! camest thou from the bridge?\n"+
		"FLUELLEN\n"+
		"Ay, so please your majesty. The Duke of Exeter has\n"+
		"very gallantly maintained the pridge: the French is\n"+
		"gone off, look you; and there is gallant and most\n"+
		"prave passages; marry, th' athversary was have\n"+
		"possession of the pridge; but he is enforced to\n"+
		"retire, and the Duke of Exeter is master of the\n"+
		"pridge: I can tell your majesty, the duke is a\n"+
		"prave man.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"What men have you lost, Fluellen?\n"+
		"FLUELLEN\n"+
		"The perdition of th' athversary hath been very\n"+
		"great, reasonable great: marry, for my part, I\n"+
		"think the duke hath lost never a man, but one that\n"+
		"is like to be executed for robbing a church, one\n"+
		"Bardolph, if your majesty know the man: his face is\n"+
		"all bubukles, and whelks, and knobs, and flames o'\n"+
		"fire: and his lips blows at his nose, and it is like\n"+
		"a coal of fire, sometimes plue and sometimes red;\n"+
		"but his nose is executed and his fire's out.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"We would have all such offenders so cut off: and we\n"+
		"give express charge, that in our marches through the\n"+
		"country, there be nothing compelled from the\n"+
		"villages, nothing taken but paid for, none of the\n"+
		"French upbraided or abused in disdainful language;\n"+
		"for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom, the\n"+
		"gentler gamester is the soonest winner.\n"+
		"Tucket. Enter MONTJOY\n"+
		"MONTJOY\n"+
		"You know me by my habit.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Well then I know thee: what shall I know of thee?\n"+
		"MONTJOY\n"+
		"My master's mind.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Unfold it.\n"+
		"MONTJOY\n"+
		"Thus says my king: Say thou to Harry of England:\n"+
		"Though we seemed dead, we did but sleep: advantage\n"+
		"is a better soldier than rashness. Tell him we\n"+
		"could have rebuked him at Harfleur, but that we\n"+
		"thought not good to bruise an injury till it were\n"+
		"full ripe: now we speak upon our cue, and our voice\n"+
		"is imperial: England shall repent his folly, see\n"+
		"his weakness, and admire our sufferance. Bid him\n"+
		"therefore consider of his ransom; which must\n"+
		"proportion the losses we have borne, the subjects we\n"+
		"have lost, the disgrace we have digested; which in\n"+
		"weight to re-answer, his pettiness would bow under.\n"+
		"For our losses, his exchequer is too poor; for the\n"+
		"effusion of our blood, the muster of his kingdom too\n"+
		"faint a number; and for our disgrace, his own\n"+
		"person, kneeling at our feet, but a weak and\n"+
		"worthless satisfaction. To this add defiance: and\n"+
		"tell him, for conclusion, he hath betrayed his\n"+
		"followers, whose condemnation is pronounced. So far\n"+
		"my king and master; so much my office.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"What is thy name? I know thy quality.\n"+
		"MONTJOY\n"+
		"Montjoy.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Thou dost thy office fairly. Turn thee back.\n"+
		"And tell thy king I do not seek him now;\n"+
		"But could be willing to march on to Calais\n"+
		"Without impeachment: for, to say the sooth,\n"+
		"Though 'tis no wisdom to confess so much\n"+
		"Unto an enemy of craft and vantage,\n"+
		"My people are with sickness much enfeebled,\n"+
		"My numbers lessened, and those few I have\n"+
		"Almost no better than so many French;\n"+
		"Who when they were in health, I tell thee, herald,\n"+
		"I thought upon one pair of English legs\n"+
		"Did march three Frenchmen. Yet, forgive me, God,\n"+
		"That I do brag thus! This your air of France\n"+
		"Hath blown that vice in me: I must repent.\n"+
		"Go therefore, tell thy master here I am;\n"+
		"My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk,\n"+
		"My army but a weak and sickly guard;\n"+
		"Yet, God before, tell him we will come on,\n"+
		"Though France himself and such another neighbour\n"+
		"Stand in our way. There's for thy labour, Montjoy.\n"+
		"Go bid thy master well advise himself:\n"+
		"If we may pass, we will; if we be hinder'd,\n"+
		"We shall your tawny ground with your red blood\n"+
		"Discolour: and so Montjoy, fare you well.\n"+
		"The sum of all our answer is but this:\n"+
		"We would not seek a battle, as we are;\n"+
		"Nor, as we are, we say we will not shun it:\n"+
		"So tell your master.\n"+
		"MONTJOY\n"+
		"I shall deliver so. Thanks to your highness.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"I hope they will not come upon us now.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"We are in God's hand, brother, not in theirs.\n"+
		"March to the bridge; it now draws toward night:\n"+
		"Beyond the river we'll encamp ourselves,\n"+
		"And on to-morrow, bid them march away.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE VII. The French camp, near Agincourt:\n"+
		"Enter the Constable of France, the LORD RAMBURES, ORLEANS, DAUPHIN, with others\n"+
		"Constable\n"+
		"Tut! I have the best armour of the world. Would it were day!\n"+
		"ORLEANS\n"+
		"You have an excellent armour; but let my horse have his due.\n"+
		"Constable\n"+
		"It is the best horse of Europe.\n"+
		"ORLEANS\n"+
		"Will it never be morning?\n"+
		"DAUPHIN\n"+
		"My lord of Orleans, and my lord high constable, you\n"+
		"talk of horse and armour?\n"+
		"ORLEANS\n"+
		"You are as well provided of both as any prince in the world.\n"+
		"DAUPHIN\n"+
		"What a long night is this! I will not change my\n"+
		"horse with any that treads but on four pasterns.\n"+
		"Ca, ha! he bounds from the earth, as if his\n"+
		"entrails were hairs; le cheval volant, the Pegasus,\n"+
		"chez les narines de feu! When I bestride him, I\n"+
		"soar, I am a hawk: he trots the air; the earth\n"+
		"sings when he touches it; the basest horn of his\n"+
		"hoof is more musical than the pipe of Hermes.\n"+
		"ORLEANS\n"+
		"He's of the colour of the nutmeg.\n"+
		"DAUPHIN\n"+
		"And of the heat of the ginger. It is a beast for\n"+
		"Perseus: he is pure air and fire; and the dull\n"+
		"elements of earth and water never appear in him, but\n"+
		"only in Patient stillness while his rider mounts\n"+
		"him: he is indeed a horse; and all other jades you\n"+
		"may call beasts.\n"+
		"Constable\n"+
		"Indeed, my lord, it is a most absolute and excellent horse.\n"+
		"DAUPHIN\n"+
		"It is the prince of palfreys; his neigh is like the\n"+
		"bidding of a monarch and his countenance enforces homage.\n"+
		"ORLEANS\n"+
		"No more, cousin.\n"+
		"DAUPHIN\n"+
		"Nay, the man hath no wit that cannot, from the\n"+
		"rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb, vary\n"+
		"deserved praise on my palfrey: it is a theme as\n"+
		"fluent as the sea: turn the sands into eloquent\n"+
		"tongues, and my horse is argument for them all:\n"+
		"'tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on, and for\n"+
		"a sovereign's sovereign to ride on; and for the\n"+
		"world, familiar to us and unknown to lay apart\n"+
		"their particular functions and wonder at him. I\n"+
		"once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus:\n"+
		"'Wonder of nature,'--\n"+
		"ORLEANS\n"+
		"I have heard a sonnet begin so to one's mistress.\n"+
		"DAUPHIN\n"+
		"Then did they imitate that which I composed to my\n"+
		"courser, for my horse is my mistress.\n"+
		"ORLEANS\n"+
		"Your mistress bears well.\n"+
		"DAUPHIN\n"+
		"Me well; which is the prescript praise and\n"+
		"perfection of a good and particular mistress.\n"+
		"Constable\n"+
		"Nay, for methought yesterday your mistress shrewdly\n"+
		"shook your back.\n"+
		"DAUPHIN\n"+
		"So perhaps did yours.\n"+
		"Constable\n"+
		"Mine was not bridled.\n"+
		"DAUPHIN\n"+
		"O then belike she was old and gentle; and you rode,\n"+
		"like a kern of Ireland, your French hose off, and in\n"+
		"your straight strossers.\n"+
		"Constable\n"+
		"You have good judgment in horsemanship.\n"+
		"DAUPHIN\n"+
		"Be warned by me, then: they that ride so and ride\n"+
		"not warily, fall into foul bogs. I had rather have\n"+
		"my horse to my mistress.\n"+
		"Constable\n"+
		"I had as lief have my mistress a jade.\n"+
		"DAUPHIN\n"+
		"I tell thee, constable, my mistress wears his own hair.\n"+
		"Constable\n"+
		"I could make as true a boast as that, if I had a sow\n"+
		"to my mistress.\n"+
		"DAUPHIN\n"+
		"'Le chien est retourne a son propre vomissement, et\n"+
		"la truie lavee au bourbier;' thou makest use of any thing.\n"+
		"Constable\n"+
		"Yet do I not use my horse for my mistress, or any\n"+
		"such proverb so little kin to the purpose.\n"+
		"RAMBURES\n"+
		"My lord constable, the armour that I saw in your tent\n"+
		"to-night, are those stars or suns upon it?\n"+
		"Constable\n"+
		"Stars, my lord.\n"+
		"DAUPHIN\n"+
		"Some of them will fall to-morrow, I hope.\n"+
		"Constable\n"+
		"And yet my sky shall not want.\n"+
		"DAUPHIN\n"+
		"That may be, for you bear a many superfluously, and\n"+
		"'twere more honour some were away.\n"+
		"Constable\n"+
		"Even as your horse bears your praises; who would\n"+
		"trot as well, were some of your brags dismounted.\n"+
		"DAUPHIN\n"+
		"Would I were able to load him with his desert! Will\n"+
		"it never be day? I will trot to-morrow a mile, and\n"+
		"my way shall be paved with English faces.\n"+
		"Constable\n"+
		"I will not say so, for fear I should be faced out of\n"+
		"my way: but I would it were morning; for I would\n"+
		"fain be about the ears of the English.\n"+
		"RAMBURES\n"+
		"Who will go to hazard with me for twenty prisoners?\n"+
		"Constable\n"+
		"You must first go yourself to hazard, ere you have them.\n"+
		"DAUPHIN\n"+
		"'Tis midnight; I'll go arm myself.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"ORLEANS\n"+
		"The Dauphin longs for morning.\n"+
		"RAMBURES\n"+
		"He longs to eat the English.\n"+
		"Constable\n"+
		"I think he will eat all he kills.\n"+
		"ORLEANS\n"+
		"By the white hand of my lady, he's a gallant prince.\n"+
		"Constable\n"+
		"Swear by her foot, that she may tread out the oath.\n"+
		"ORLEANS\n"+
		"He is simply the most active gentleman of France.\n"+
		"Constable\n"+
		"Doing is activity; and he will still be doing.\n"+
		"ORLEANS\n"+
		"He never did harm, that I heard of.\n"+
		"Constable\n"+
		"Nor will do none to-morrow: he will keep that good name still.\n"+
		"ORLEANS\n"+
		"I know him to be valiant.\n"+
		"Constable\n"+
		"I was told that by one that knows him better than\n"+
		"you.\n"+
		"ORLEANS\n"+
		"What's he?\n"+
		"Constable\n"+
		"Marry, he told me so himself; and he said he cared\n"+
		"not who knew it\n"+
		"ORLEANS\n"+
		"He needs not; it is no hidden virtue in him.\n"+
		"Constable\n"+
		"By my faith, sir, but it is; never any body saw it\n"+
		"but his lackey: 'tis a hooded valour; and when it\n"+
		"appears, it will bate.\n"+
		"ORLEANS\n"+
		"Ill will never said well.\n"+

		"I will cap that proverb with 'There is flattery in friendship.'\n"+
		"ORLEANS\n"+
		"And I will take up that with 'Give the devil his due.'\n"+
		"Constable\n"+
		"Well placed: there stands your friend for the\n"+
		"devil: have at the very eye of that proverb with 'A\n"+
		"pox of the devil.'\n"+
		"ORLEANS\n"+
		"You are the better at proverbs, by how much 'A\n"+
		"fool's bolt is soon shot.'\n"+
		"Constable\n"+
		"You have shot over.\n"+

		"RAMBURES\n"+
		"That island of England breeds very valiant\n"+
		"creatures; their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage.\n"+
		"ORLEANS\n"+
		"Foolish curs, that run winking into the mouth of a\n"+
		"Russian bear and have their heads crushed like\n"+
		"rotten apples! You may as well say, that's a\n"+

		"ORLEANS\n"+
		"Ay, but these English are shrewdly out of beef.\n"+
		"Constable\n"+
		"Then shall we find to-morrow they have only stomachs\n"+

		"Enter Chorus\n"+
		"Chorus\n"+
		"Now entertain conjecture of a time\n"+
		"When creeping murmur and the poring dark\n"+
		"Fills the wide vessel of the universe.\n"+
		"From camp to camp through the foul womb of night\n"+
		"The hum of either army stilly sounds,\n"+
		"That the fixed sentinels almost receive\n"+
		"The secret whispers of each other's watch:\n"+
		"Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames\n"+
		"Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;\n"+
		"Steed threatens steed, in high and boastful neighs\n"+
		"Piercing the night's dull ear, and from the tents\n"+
		"The armourers, accomplishing the knights,\n"+
		"With busy hammers closing rivets up,\n"+
		"Give dreadful note of preparation:\n"+
		"The country cocks do crow, the clocks do toll,\n"+
		"And the third hour of drowsy morning name.\n"+
		"Proud of their numbers and secure in soul,\n"+
		"The confident and over-lusty French\n"+
		"Do the low-rated English play at dice;\n"+
		"And chide the cripple tardy-gaited night\n"+
		"Who, like a foul and ugly witch, doth limp\n"+
		"So tediously away. The poor condemned English,\n"+
		"Like sacrifices, by their watchful fires\n"+
		"Sit patiently and inly ruminate\n"+
		"The morning's danger, and their gesture sad\n"+
		"Investing lank-lean; cheeks and war-worn coats\n"+
		"Presenteth them unto the gazing moon\n"+
		"So many horrid ghosts. O now, who will behold\n"+
		"The royal captain of this ruin'd band\n"+
		"Walking from watch to watch, from tent to tent,\n"+
		"Let him cry 'Praise and glory on his head!'\n"+
		"For forth he goes and visits all his host.\n"+
		"Bids them good morrow with a modest smile\n"+
		"And calls them brothers, friends and countrymen.\n"+
		"Upon his royal face there is no note\n"+
		"How dread an army hath enrounded him;\n"+
		"Nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour\n"+
		"Unto the weary and all-watched night,\n"+
		"But freshly looks and over-bears attaint\n"+
		"With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty;\n"+
		"That every wretch, pining and pale before,\n"+
		"Beholding him, plucks comfort from his looks:\n"+
		"A largess universal like the sun\n"+
		"His liberal eye doth give to every one,\n"+
		"Thawing cold fear, that mean and gentle all,\n"+
		"Behold, as may unworthiness define,\n"+
		"A little touch of Harry in the night.\n"+
		"And so our scene must to the battle fly;\n"+
		"Where--O for pity!--we shall much disgrace\n"+
		"With four or five most vile and ragged foils,\n"+
		"Right ill-disposed in brawl ridiculous,\n"+
		"The name of Agincourt. Yet sit and see,\n"+
		"Minding true things by what their mockeries be.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE I. The English camp at Agincourt.\n"+
		"Enter KING HENRY, BEDFORD, and GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Gloucester, 'tis true that we are in great danger;\n"+
		"The greater therefore should our courage be.\n"+
		"Good morrow, brother Bedford. God Almighty!\n"+
		"There is some soul of goodness in things evil,\n"+
		"Would men observingly distil it out.\n"+
		"For our bad neighbour makes us early stirrers,\n"+
		"Which is both healthful and good husbandry:\n"+
		"Besides, they are our outward consciences,\n"+
		"And preachers to us all, admonishing\n"+
		"That we should dress us fairly for our end.\n"+
		"Thus may we gather honey from the weed,\n"+
		"And make a moral of the devil himself.\n"+
		"Enter ERPINGHAM\n"+
		"Good morrow, old Sir Thomas Erpingham:\n"+
		"A good soft pillow for that good white head\n"+
		"Were better than a churlish turf of France.\n"+
		"ERPINGHAM\n"+
		"Not so, my liege: this lodging likes me better,\n"+
		"Since I may say 'Now lie I like a king.'\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"'Tis good for men to love their present pains\n"+
		"Upon example; so the spirit is eased:\n"+
		"And when the mind is quicken'd, out of doubt,\n"+
		"The organs, though defunct and dead before,\n"+
		"Break up their drowsy grave and newly move,\n"+
		"With casted slough and fresh legerity.\n"+
		"Lend me thy cloak, Sir Thomas. Brothers both,\n"+
		"Commend me to the princes in our camp;\n"+
		"Do my good morrow to them, and anon\n"+
		"Desire them an to my pavilion.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"We shall, my liege.\n"+
		"ERPINGHAM\n"+
		"Shall I attend your grace?\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"No, my good knight;\n"+
		"Go with my brothers to my lords of England:\n"+
		"I and my bosom must debate awhile,\n"+
		"And then I would no other company.\n"+
		"ERPINGHAM\n"+
		"The Lord in heaven bless thee, noble Harry!\n"+
		"Exeunt all but KING HENRY\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"God-a-mercy, old heart! thou speak'st cheerfully.\n"+
		"Enter PISTOL\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"Qui va la?\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"A friend.\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"Discuss unto me; art thou officer?\n"+
		"Or art thou base, common and popular?\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"I am a gentleman of a company.\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"Trail'st thou the puissant pike?\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Even so. What are you?\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"As good a gentleman as the emperor.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Then you are a better than the king.\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"The king's a bawcock, and a heart of gold,\n"+
		"A lad of life, an imp of fame;\n"+
		"Of parents good, of fist most valiant.\n"+
		"I kiss his dirty shoe, and from heart-string\n"+
		"I love the lovely bully. What is thy name?\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Harry le Roy.\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"Le Roy! a Cornish name: art thou of Cornish crew?\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"No, I am a Welshman.\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"Know'st thou Fluellen?\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Yes.\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"Tell him, I'll knock his leek about his pate\n"+
		"Upon Saint Davy's day.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Do not you wear your dagger in your cap that day,\n"+
		"lest he knock that about yours.\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"Art thou his friend?\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"And his kinsman too.\n"+

		"The figo for thee, then!\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"I thank you: God be with you!\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"My name is Pistol call'd.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"It sorts well with your fierceness.\n"+
		"Enter FLUELLEN and GOWER\n"+
		"GOWER\n"+
		"Captain Fluellen!\n"+
		"FLUELLEN\n"+
		"So! in the name of Jesu Christ, speak lower. It is\n"+
		"the greatest admiration of the universal world, when\n"+
		"the true and aunchient prerogatifes and laws of the\n"+
		"wars is not kept: if you would take the pains but to\n"+
		"examine the wars of Pompey the Great, you shall\n"+
		"find, I warrant you, that there is no tiddle toddle\n"+
		"nor pibble pabble in Pompey's camp; I warrant you,\n"+
		"you shall find the ceremonies of the wars, and the\n"+
		"cares of it, and the forms of it, and the sobriety\n"+
		"of it, and the modesty of it, to be otherwise.\n"+
		"GOWER\n"+
		"Why, the enemy is loud; you hear him all night.\n"+
		"FLUELLEN\n"+
		"If the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating\n"+
		"coxcomb, is it meet, think you, that we should also,\n"+
		"look you, be an ass and a fool and a prating\n"+
		"coxcomb? in your own conscience, now?\n"+
		"GOWER\n"+
		"I will speak lower.\n"+
		"FLUELLEN\n"+
		"I pray you and beseech you that you will.\n"+
		"Exeunt GOWER and FLUELLEN\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Though it appear a little out of fashion,\n"+
		"There is much care and valour in this Welshman.\n"+
		"Enter three soldiers, JOHN BATES, ALEXANDER COURT, and MICHAEL WILLIAMS\n"+
		"COURT\n"+
		"Brother John Bates, is not that the morning which\n"+
		"breaks yonder?\n"+
		"BATES\n"+
		"I think it be: but we have no great cause to desire\n"+
		"the approach of day.\n"+
		"WILLIAMS\n"+
		"We see yonder the beginning of the day, but I think\n"+
		"we shall never see the end of it. Who goes there?\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"A friend.\n"+
		"WILLIAMS\n"+
		"Under what captain serve you?\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Under Sir Thomas Erpingham.\n"+
		"WILLIAMS\n"+
		"A good old commander and a most kind gentleman: I\n"+
		"pray you, what thinks he of our estate?\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Even as men wrecked upon a sand, that look to be\n"+
		"washed off the next tide.\n"+
		"BATES\n"+
		"He hath not told his thought to the king?\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"No; nor it is not meet he should. For, though I\n"+
		"speak it to you, I think the king is but a man, as I\n"+
		"am: the violet smells to him as it doth to me: the\n"+
		"element shows to him as it doth to me; all his\n"+
		"senses have but human conditions: his ceremonies\n"+
		"laid by, in his nakedness he appears but a man; and\n"+
		"though his affections are higher mounted than ours,\n"+
		"yet, when they stoop, they stoop with the like\n"+
		"wing. Therefore when he sees reason of fears, as we\n"+
		"do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish\n"+
		"as ours are: yet, in reason, no man should possess\n"+
		"him with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing\n"+
		"it, should dishearten his army.\n"+
		"BATES\n"+
		"He may show what outward courage he will; but I\n"+
		"believe, as cold a night as 'tis, he could wish\n"+
		"himself in Thames up to the neck; and so I would he\n"+
		"were, and I by him, at all adventures, so we were quit here.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"By my troth, I will speak my conscience of the king:\n"+
		"I think he would not wish himself any where but\n"+
		"where he is.\n"+
		"BATES\n"+
		"Then I would he were here alone; so should he be\n"+
		"sure to be ransomed, and a many poor men's lives saved.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"I dare say you love him not so ill, to wish him here\n"+
		"alone, howsoever you speak this to feel other men's\n"+
		"minds: methinks I could not die any where so\n"+
		"contented as in the king's company; his cause being\n"+
		"just and his quarrel honourable.\n"+
		"WILLIAMS\n"+
		"That's more than we know.\n"+
		"BATES\n"+
		"Ay, or more than we should seek after; for we know\n"+
		"enough, if we know we are the kings subjects: if\n"+
		"his cause be wrong, our obedience to the king wipes\n"+
		"the crime of it out of us.\n"+
		"WILLIAMS\n"+
		"But if the cause be not good, the king himself hath\n"+
		"a heavy reckoning to make, when all those legs and\n"+
		"arms and heads, chopped off in battle, shall join\n"+
		"together at the latter day and cry all 'We died at\n"+
		"such a place;' some swearing, some crying for a\n"+
		"surgeon, some upon their wives left poor behind\n"+
		"them, some upon the debts they owe, some upon their\n"+
		"children rawly left. I am afeard there are few die\n"+
		"well that die in a battle; for how can they\n"+
		"charitably dispose of any thing, when blood is their\n"+
		"argument? Now, if these men do not die well, it\n"+
		"will be a black matter for the king that led them to\n"+
		"it; whom to disobey were against all proportion of\n"+
		"subjection.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"So, if a son that is by his father sent about\n"+
		"merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea, the\n"+
		"imputation of his wickedness by your rule, should be\n"+
		"imposed upon his father that sent him: or if a\n"+
		"servant, under his master's command transporting a\n"+
		"sum of money, be assailed by robbers and die in\n"+
		"many irreconciled iniquities, you may call the\n"+
		"business of the master the author of the servant's\n"+
		"damnation: but this is not so: the king is not\n"+
		"bound to answer the particular endings of his\n"+
		"soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of\n"+
		"his servant; for they purpose not their death, when\n"+
		"they purpose their services. Besides, there is no\n"+
		"king, be his cause never so spotless, if it come to\n"+
		"the arbitrement of swords, can try it out with all\n"+
		"unspotted soldiers: some peradventure have on them\n"+
		"the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder;\n"+
		"some, of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of\n"+
		"perjury; some, making the wars their bulwark, that\n"+
		"have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with\n"+
		"pillage and robbery. Now, if these men have\n"+
		"defeated the law and outrun native punishment,\n"+
		"though they can outstrip men, they have no wings to\n"+
		"fly from God: war is his beadle, war is vengeance;\n"+
		"so that here men are punished for before-breach of\n"+
		"the king's laws in now the king's quarrel: where\n"+
		"they feared the death, they have borne life away;\n"+
		"and where they would be safe, they perish: then if\n"+
		"they die unprovided, no more is the king guilty of\n"+
		"their damnation than he was before guilty of those\n"+
		"impieties for the which they are now visited. Every\n"+
		"subject's duty is the king's; but every subject's\n"+
		"soul is his own. Therefore should every soldier in\n"+
		"the wars do as every sick man in his bed, wash every\n"+
		"mote out of his conscience: and dying so, death\n"+
		"is to him advantage; or not dying, the time was\n"+
		"blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained:\n"+
		"and in him that escapes, it were not sin to think\n"+
		"that, making God so free an offer, He let him\n"+
		"outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach\n"+
		"others how they should prepare.\n"+
		"WILLIAMS\n"+
		"'Tis certain, every man that dies ill, the ill upon\n"+
		"his own head, the king is not to answer it.\n"+
		"BATES\n"+
		"But I do not desire he should answer for me; and\n"+
		"yet I determine to fight lustily for him.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed.\n"+
		"WILLIAMS\n"+
		"Ay, he said so, to make us fight cheerfully: but\n"+
		"when our throats are cut, he may be ransomed, and we\n"+
		"ne'er the wiser.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"If I live to see it, I will never trust his word after.\n"+
		"WILLIAMS\n"+
		"You pay him then. That's a perilous shot out of an\n"+
		"elder-gun, that a poor and private displeasure can\n"+
		"do against a monarch! you may as well go about to\n"+
		"turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a\n"+
		"peacock's feather. You'll never trust his word\n"+
		"after! come, 'tis a foolish saying.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Your reproof is something too round: I should be\n"+
		"angry with you, if the time were convenient.\n"+
		"WILLIAMS\n"+
		"Let it be a quarrel between us, if you live.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"I embrace it.\n"+
		"WILLIAMS\n"+
		"How shall I know thee again?\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Give me any gage of thine, and I will wear it in my\n"+
		"bonnet: then, if ever thou darest acknowledge it, I\n"+
		"will make it my quarrel.\n"+
		"WILLIAMS\n"+
		"Here's my glove: give me another of thine.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"There.\n"+
		"WILLIAMS\n"+
		"This will I also wear in my cap: if ever thou come\n"+
		"to me and say, after to-morrow, 'This is my glove,'\n"+
		"by this hand, I will take thee a box on the ear.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"If ever I live to see it, I will challenge it.\n"+
		"WILLIAMS\n"+
		"Thou darest as well be hanged.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Well. I will do it, though I take thee in the\n"+
		"king's company.\n"+
		"WILLIAMS\n"+
		"Keep thy word: fare thee well.\n"+
		"BATES\n"+
		"Be friends, you English fools, be friends: we have\n"+
		"French quarrels enow, if you could tell how to reckon.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Indeed, the French may lay twenty French crowns to\n"+
		"one, they will beat us; for they bear them on their\n"+
		"shoulders: but it is no English treason to cut\n"+
		"French crowns, and to-morrow the king himself will\n"+
		"be a clipper.\n"+
		"Exeunt soldiers\n"+
		"Upon the king! let us our lives, our souls,\n"+
		"Our debts, our careful wives,\n"+
		"Our children and our sins lay on the king!\n"+
		"We must bear all. O hard condition,\n"+
		"Twin-born with greatness, subject to the breath\n"+
		"Of every fool, whose sense no more can feel\n"+
		"But his own wringing! What infinite heart's-ease\n"+
		"Must kings neglect, that private men enjoy!\n"+
		"And what have kings, that privates have not too,\n"+
		"Save ceremony, save general ceremony?\n"+
		"And what art thou, thou idle ceremony?\n"+
		"What kind of god art thou, that suffer'st more\n"+
		"Of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers?\n"+
		"What are thy rents? what are thy comings in?\n"+
		"O ceremony, show me but thy worth!\n"+
		"What is thy soul of adoration?\n"+
		"Art thou aught else but place, degree and form,\n"+
		"Creating awe and fear in other men?\n"+
		"Wherein thou art less happy being fear'd\n"+
		"Than they in fearing.\n"+
		"What drink'st thou oft, instead of homage sweet,\n"+
		"But poison'd flattery? O, be sick, great greatness,\n"+
		"And bid thy ceremony give thee cure!\n"+
		"Think'st thou the fiery fever will go out\n"+
		"With titles blown from adulation?\n"+
		"Will it give place to flexure and low bending?\n"+
		"Canst thou, when thou command'st the beggar's knee,\n"+
		"Command the health of it? No, thou proud dream,\n"+
		"That play'st so subtly with a king's repose;\n"+
		"I am a king that find thee, and I know\n"+
		"'Tis not the balm, the sceptre and the ball,\n"+
		"The sword, the mace, the crown imperial,\n"+
		"The intertissued robe of gold and pearl,\n"+
		"The farced title running 'fore the king,\n"+
		"The throne he sits on, nor the tide of pomp\n"+
		"That beats upon the high shore of this world,\n"+
		"No, not all these, thrice-gorgeous ceremony,\n"+
		"Not all these, laid in bed majestical,\n"+
		"Can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave,\n"+
		"Who with a body fill'd and vacant mind\n"+
		"Gets him to rest, cramm'd with distressful bread;\n"+
		"Never sees horrid night, the child of hell,\n"+
		"But, like a lackey, from the rise to set\n"+
		"Sweats in the eye of Phoebus and all night\n"+
		"Sleeps in Elysium; next day after dawn,\n"+
		"Doth rise and help Hyperion to his horse,\n"+
		"And follows so the ever-running year,\n"+
		"With profitable labour, to his grave:\n"+
		"And, but for ceremony, such a wretch,\n"+
		"Winding up days with toil and nights with sleep,\n"+
		"Had the fore-hand and vantage of a king.\n"+
		"The slave, a member of the country's peace,\n"+
		"Enjoys it; but in gross brain little wots\n"+
		"What watch the king keeps to maintain the peace,\n"+
		"Whose hours the peasant best advantages.\n"+
		"Enter ERPINGHAM\n"+
		"ERPINGHAM\n"+
		"My lord, your nobles, jealous of your absence,\n"+

		"O, not to-day, think not upon the fault\n"+
		"My father made in compassing the crown!\n"+
		"I Richard's body have interred anew;\n"+
		"And on it have bestow'd more contrite tears\n"+

		"Who twice a-day their wither'd hands hold up\n"+
		"Toward heaven, to pardon blood; and I have built\n"+
		"Two chantries, where the sad and solemn priests\n"+
		"Sing still for Richard's soul. More will I do;\n"+
		"Though all that I can do is nothing worth,\n"+
		"Since that my penitence comes after all,\n"+

		"The tucket sonance and the note to mount;\n"+
		"For our approach shall so much dare the field\n"+
		"That England shall couch down in fear and yield.\n"+
		"Enter GRANDPRE\n"+
		"GRANDPRE\n"+
		"Why do you stay so long, my lords of France?\n"+
		"Yon island carrions, desperate of their bones,\n"+
		"Ill-favouredly become the morning field:\n"+
		"Their ragged curtains poorly are let loose,\n"+
		"And our air shakes them passing scornfully:\n"+
		"Big Mars seems bankrupt in their beggar'd host\n"+
		"And faintly through a rusty beaver peeps:\n"+
		"The horsemen sit like fixed candlesticks,\n"+
		"With torch-staves in their hand; and their poor jades\n"+
		"Lob down their heads, dropping the hides and hips,\n"+
		"The gum down-roping from their pale-dead eyes\n"+
		"And in their pale dull mouths the gimmal bit\n"+
		"Lies foul with chew'd grass, still and motionless;\n"+
		"And their executors, the knavish crows,\n"+
		"Fly o'er them, all impatient for their hour.\n"+
		"Description cannot suit itself in words\n"+
		"To demonstrate the life of such a battle\n"+
		"In life so lifeless as it shows itself.\n"+
		"Constable\n"+
		"They have said their prayers, and they stay for death.\n"+
		"DAUPHIN\n"+
		"Shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits\n"+
		"And give their fasting horses provender,\n"+
		"And after fight with them?\n"+
		"Constable\n"+
		"I stay but for my guidon: to the field!\n"+
		"I will the banner from a trumpet take,\n"+
		"And use it for my haste. Come, come, away!\n"+
		"The sun is high, and we outwear the day.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. The English camp.\n"+

		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Where is the king?\n"+
		"BEDFORD\n"+
		"The king himself is rode to view their battle.\n"+

		"Of fighting men they have full three score thousand.\n"+
		"EXETER\n"+
		"There's five to one; besides, they all are fresh.\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"God's arm strike with us! 'tis a fearful odds.\n"+
		"God be wi' you, princes all; I'll to my charge:\n"+
		"If we no more meet till we meet in heaven,\n"+
		"Then, joyfully, my noble Lord of Bedford,\n"+
		"My dear Lord Gloucester, and my good Lord Exeter,\n"+
		"And my kind kinsman, warriors all, adieu!\n"+
		"BEDFORD\n"+
		"Farewell, good Salisbury; and good luck go with thee!\n"+
		"EXETER\n"+
		"Farewell, kind lord; fight valiantly to-day:\n"+
		"And yet I do thee wrong to mind thee of it,\n"+
		"For thou art framed of the firm truth of valour.\n"+
		"Exit SALISBURY\n"+
		"BEDFORD\n"+
		"He is full of valour as of kindness;\n"+
		"Princely in both.\n"+
		"Enter the KING\n"+
		"WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"O that we now had here\n"+
		"But one ten thousand of those men in England\n"+
		"That do no work to-day!\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"What's he that wishes so?\n"+
		"My cousin Westmoreland? No, my fair cousin:\n"+
		"If we are mark'd to die, we are enow\n"+
		"To do our country loss; and if to live,\n"+
		"The fewer men, the greater share of honour.\n"+
		"God's will! I pray thee, wish not one man more.\n"+
		"By Jove, I am not covetous for gold,\n"+
		"Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost;\n"+
		"It yearns me not if men my garments wear;\n"+
		"Such outward things dwell not in my desires:\n"+
		"But if it be a sin to covet honour,\n"+
		"I am the most offending soul alive.\n"+
		"No, faith, my coz, wish not a man from England:\n"+
		"God's peace! I would not lose so great an honour\n"+
		"As one man more, methinks, would share from me\n"+
		"For the best hope I have. O, do not wish one more!\n"+
		"Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my host,\n"+
		"That he which hath no stomach to this fight,\n"+
		"Let him depart; his passport shall be made\n"+
		"And crowns for convoy put into his purse:\n"+
		"We would not die in that man's company\n"+
		"That fears his fellowship to die with us.\n"+
		"This day is called the feast of Crispian:\n"+
		"He that outlives this day, and comes safe home,\n"+
		"Will stand a tip-toe when the day is named,\n"+
		"And rouse him at the name of Crispian.\n"+
		"He that shall live this day, and see old age,\n"+
		"Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours,\n"+
		"And say 'To-morrow is Saint Crispian:'\n"+
		"Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars.\n"+
		"And say 'These wounds I had on Crispin's day.'\n"+
		"Old men forget: yet all shall be forgot,\n"+
		"But he'll remember with advantages\n"+
		"What feats he did that day: then shall our names.\n"+
		"Familiar in his mouth as household words\n"+
		"Harry the king, Bedford and Exeter,\n"+
		"Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester,\n"+
		"Be in their flowing cups freshly remember'd.\n"+
		"This story shall the good man teach his son;\n"+
		"And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,\n"+
		"From this day to the ending of the world,\n"+
		"But we in it shall be remember'd;\n"+
		"We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;\n"+
		"For he to-day that sheds his blood with me\n"+
		"Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,\n"+
		"This day shall gentle his condition:\n"+
		"And gentlemen in England now a-bed\n"+
		"Shall think themselves accursed they were not here,\n"+
		"And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks\n"+
		"That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day.\n"+
		"Re-enter SALISBURY\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"My sovereign lord, bestow yourself with speed:\n"+
		"The French are bravely in their battles set,\n"+
		"And will with all expedience charge on us.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"All things are ready, if our minds be so.\n"+
		"WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"Perish the man whose mind is backward now!\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Thou dost not wish more help from England, coz?\n"+
		"WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"God's will! my liege, would you and I alone,\n"+
		"Without more help, could fight this royal battle!\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Why, now thou hast unwish'd five thousand men;\n"+
		"Which likes me better than to wish us one.\n"+
		"You know your places: God be with you all!\n"+
		"Tucket. Enter MONTJOY\n"+
		"MONTJOY\n"+
		"Once more I come to know of thee, King Harry,\n"+
		"If for thy ransom thou wilt now compound,\n"+
		"Before thy most assured overthrow:\n"+
		"For certainly thou art so near the gulf,\n"+
		"Thou needs must be englutted. Besides, in mercy,\n"+
		"The constable desires thee thou wilt mind\n"+
		"Thy followers of repentance; that their souls\n"+
		"May make a peaceful and a sweet retire\n"+
		"From off these fields, where, wretches, their poor bodies\n"+
		"Must lie and fester.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Who hath sent thee now?\n"+
		"MONTJOY\n"+
		"The Constable of France.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"I pray thee, bear my former answer back:\n"+
		"Bid them achieve me and then sell my bones.\n"+
		"Good God! why should they mock poor fellows thus?\n"+
		"The man that once did sell the lion's skin\n"+
		"While the beast lived, was killed with hunting him.\n"+
		"A many of our bodies shall no doubt\n"+
		"Find native graves; upon the which, I trust,\n"+
		"Shall witness live in brass of this day's work:\n"+
		"And those that leave their valiant bones in France,\n"+
		"Dying like men, though buried in your dunghills,\n"+
		"They shall be famed; for there the sun shall greet them,\n"+
		"And draw their honours reeking up to heaven;\n"+
		"Leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime,\n"+
		"The smell whereof shall breed a plague in France.\n"+
		"Mark then abounding valour in our English,\n"+
		"That being dead, like to the bullet's grazing,\n"+
		"Break out into a second course of mischief,\n"+
		"Killing in relapse of mortality.\n"+
		"Let me speak proudly: tell the constable\n"+
		"We are but warriors for the working-day;\n"+
		"Our gayness and our gilt are all besmirch'd\n"+
		"With rainy marching in the painful field;\n"+
		"There's not a piece of feather in our host--\n"+
		"Good argument, I hope, we will not fly--\n"+
		"And time hath worn us into slovenry:\n"+
		"But, by the mass, our hearts are in the trim;\n"+
		"And my poor soldiers tell me, yet ere night\n"+
		"They'll be in fresher robes, or they will pluck\n"+
		"The gay new coats o'er the French soldiers' heads\n"+
		"And turn them out of service. If they do this,--\n"+
		"As, if God please, they shall,--my ransom then\n"+
		"Will soon be levied. Herald, save thou thy labour;\n"+
		"Come thou no more for ransom, gentle herald:\n"+
		"They shall have none, I swear, but these my joints;\n"+
		"Which if they have as I will leave 'em them,\n"+
		"Shall yield them little, tell the constable.\n"+
		"MONTJOY\n"+
		"I shall, King Harry. And so fare thee well:\n"+
		"Thou never shalt hear herald any more.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"I fear thou'lt once more come again for ransom.\n"+
		"Enter YORK\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"My lord, most humbly on my knee I beg\n"+
		"The leading of the vaward.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Take it, brave York. Now, soldiers, march away:\n"+
		"And how thou pleasest, God, dispose the day!\n"+

		"What are his words?\n"+
		"Boy\n"+
		"He prays you to save his life: he is a gentleman of\n"+

		"Exeunt PISTOL, and French Soldier\n"+
		"I did never know so full a voice issue from so\n"+

		"the old play, that every one may pare his nails with\n"+
		"a wooden dagger; and they are both hanged; and so\n"+
		"would this be, if he durst steal any thing\n"+
		"adventurously. I must stay with the lackeys, with\n"+

		"BOURBON\n"+
		"Shame and eternal shame, nothing but shame!\n"+

		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Well have we done, thrice valiant countrymen:\n"+

		"EXETER\n"+
		"The Duke of York commends him to your majesty.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Lives he, good uncle? thrice within this hour\n"+
		"I saw him down; thrice up again and fighting;\n"+
		"From helmet to the spur all blood he was.\n"+
		"EXETER\n"+
		"In which array, brave soldier, doth he lie,\n"+
		"Larding the plain; and by his bloody side,\n"+
		"Yoke-fellow to his honour-owing wounds,\n"+
		"The noble Earl of Suffolk also lies.\n"+
		"Suffolk first died: and York, all haggled over,\n"+
		"Comes to him, where in gore he lay insteep'd,\n"+
		"And takes him by the beard; kisses the gashes\n"+
		"That bloodily did spawn upon his face;\n"+
		"And cries aloud 'Tarry, dear cousin Suffolk!\n"+
		"My soul shall thine keep company to heaven;\n"+
		"Tarry, sweet soul, for mine, then fly abreast,\n"+
		"As in this glorious and well-foughten field\n"+
		"We kept together in our chivalry!'\n"+
		"Upon these words I came and cheer'd him up:\n"+
		"He smiled me in the face, raught me his hand,\n"+
		"And, with a feeble gripe, says 'Dear my lord,\n"+
		"Commend my service to me sovereign.'\n"+
		"So did he turn and over Suffolk's neck\n"+
		"He threw his wounded arm and kiss'd his lips;\n"+
		"And so espoused to death, with blood he seal'd\n"+
		"A testament of noble-ending love.\n"+
		"The pretty and sweet manner of it forced\n"+
		"Those waters from me which I would have stopp'd;\n"+
		"But I had not so much of man in me,\n"+
		"And all my mother came into mine eyes\n"+
		"And gave me up to tears.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"I blame you not;\n"+
		"For, hearing this, I must perforce compound\n"+
		"With mistful eyes, or they will issue too.\n"+
		"Alarum\n"+
		"But, hark! what new alarum is this same?\n"+
		"The French have reinforced their scatter'd men:\n"+
		"Then every soldier kill his prisoners:\n"+
		"Give the word through.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE VII. Another part of the field.\n"+
		"Enter FLUELLEN and GOWER\n"+
		"FLUELLEN\n"+
		"Kill the poys and the luggage! 'tis expressly\n"+
		"against the law of arms: 'tis as arrant a piece of\n"+
		"knavery, mark you now, as can be offer't; in your\n"+
		"conscience, now, is it not?\n"+
		"GOWER\n"+
		"'Tis certain there's not a boy left alive; and the\n"+
		"cowardly rascals that ran from the battle ha' done\n"+
		"this slaughter: besides, they have burned and\n"+
		"carried away all that was in the king's tent;\n"+
		"wherefore the king, most worthily, hath caused every\n"+
		"soldier to cut his prisoner's throat. O, 'tis a\n"+
		"gallant king!\n"+
		"FLUELLEN\n"+
		"Ay, he was porn at Monmouth, Captain Gower. What\n"+
		"call you the town's name where Alexander the Pig was born!\n"+
		"GOWER\n"+
		"Alexander the Great.\n"+
		"FLUELLEN\n"+
		"Why, I pray you, is not pig great? the pig, or the\n"+
		"great, or the mighty, or the huge, or the\n"+
		"magnanimous, are all one reckonings, save the phrase\n"+
		"is a little variations.\n"+
		"GOWER\n"+
		"I think Alexander the Great was born in Macedon; his\n"+
		"father was called Philip of Macedon, as I take it.\n"+
		"FLUELLEN\n"+
		"I think it is in Macedon where Alexander is porn. I\n"+
		"tell you, captain, if you look in the maps of the\n"+
		"'orld, I warrant you sall find, in the comparisons\n"+
		"between Macedon and Monmouth, that the situations,\n"+
		"look you, is both alike. There is a river in\n"+
		"Macedon; and there is also moreover a river at\n"+
		"Monmouth: it is called Wye at Monmouth; but it is\n"+
		"out of my prains what is the name of the other\n"+
		"river; but 'tis all one, 'tis alike as my fingers is\n"+
		"to my fingers, and there is salmons in both. If you\n"+
		"mark Alexander's life well, Harry of Monmouth's life\n"+
		"is come after it indifferent well; for there is\n"+
		"figures in all things. Alexander, God knows, and\n"+
		"you know, in his rages, and his furies, and his\n"+
		"wraths, and his cholers, and his moods, and his\n"+
		"displeasures, and his indignations, and also being a\n"+
		"little intoxicates in his prains, did, in his ales and\n"+
		"his angers, look you, kill his best friend, Cleitus.\n"+
		"GOWER\n"+
		"Our king is not like him in that: he never killed\n"+
		"any of his friends.\n"+
		"FLUELLEN\n"+
		"It is not well done, mark you now take the tales out\n"+
		"of my mouth, ere it is made and finished. I speak\n"+
		"but in the figures and comparisons of it: as\n"+
		"Alexander killed his friend Cleitus, being in his\n"+
		"ales and his cups; so also Harry Monmouth, being in\n"+
		"his right wits and his good judgments, turned away\n"+
		"the fat knight with the great belly-doublet: he\n"+
		"was full of jests, and gipes, and knaveries, and\n"+
		"mocks; I have forgot his name.\n"+
		"GOWER\n"+
		"Sir John Falstaff.\n"+
		"FLUELLEN\n"+
		"That is he: I'll tell you there is good men porn at Monmouth.\n"+
		"GOWER\n"+
		"Here comes his majesty.\n"+
		"Alarum. Enter KING HENRY, and forces; WARWICK, GLOUCESTER, EXETER, and others\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"I was not angry since I came to France\n"+
		"Until this instant. Take a trumpet, herald;\n"+
		"Ride thou unto the horsemen on yon hill:\n"+
		"If they will fight with us, bid them come down,\n"+
		"Or void the field; they do offend our sight:\n"+
		"If they'll do neither, we will come to them,\n"+
		"And make them skirr away, as swift as stones\n"+
		"Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:\n"+
		"Besides, we'll cut the throats of those we have,\n"+
		"And not a man of them that we shall take\n"+
		"Shall taste our mercy. Go and tell them so.\n"+
		"Enter MONTJOY\n"+
		"EXETER\n"+
		"Here comes the herald of the French, my liege.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"His eyes are humbler than they used to be.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"How now! what means this, herald? know'st thou not\n"+
		"That I have fined these bones of mine for ransom?\n"+
		"Comest thou again for ransom?\n"+
		"MONTJOY\n"+
		"No, great king:\n"+
		"I come to thee for charitable licence,\n"+
		"That we may wander o'er this bloody field\n"+
		"To look our dead, and then to bury them;\n"+
		"To sort our nobles from our common men.\n"+
		"For many of our princes--woe the while!--\n"+
		"Lie drown'd and soak'd in mercenary blood;\n"+
		"So do our vulgar drench their peasant limbs\n"+
		"In blood of princes; and their wounded steeds\n"+
		"Fret fetlock deep in gore and with wild rage\n"+
		"Yerk out their armed heels at their dead masters,\n"+
		"Killing them twice. O, give us leave, great king,\n"+
		"To view the field in safety and dispose\n"+
		"Of their dead bodies!\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"I tell thee truly, herald,\n"+
		"I know not if the day be ours or no;\n"+
		"For yet a many of your horsemen peer\n"+
		"And gallop o'er the field.\n"+
		"MONTJOY\n"+
		"The day is yours.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Praised be God, and not our strength, for it!\n"+
		"What is this castle call'd that stands hard by?\n"+
		"MONTJOY\n"+
		"They call it Agincourt.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Then call we this the field of Agincourt,\n"+
		"Fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus.\n"+
		"FLUELLEN\n"+
		"Your grandfather of famous memory, an't please your\n"+
		"majesty, and your great-uncle Edward the Plack\n"+
		"Prince of Wales, as I have read in the chronicles,\n"+
		"fought a most prave pattle here in France.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"They did, Fluellen.\n"+
		"FLUELLEN\n"+
		"Your majesty says very true: if your majesties is\n"+
		"remembered of it, the Welshmen did good service in a\n"+
		"garden where leeks did grow, wearing leeks in their\n"+
		"Monmouth caps; which, your majesty know, to this\n"+
		"hour is an honourable badge of the service; and I do\n"+
		"believe your majesty takes no scorn to wear the leek\n"+
		"upon Saint Tavy's day.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"I wear it for a memorable honour;\n"+
		"For I am Welsh, you know, good countryman.\n"+
		"FLUELLEN\n"+

		"Pales in the flood with men, with wives and boys,\n"+
		"Whose shouts and claps out-voice the deep mouth'd sea,\n"+
		"Which like a mighty whiffler 'fore the king\n"+

		"How many would the peaceful city quit,\n"+
		"To welcome him! much more, and much more cause,\n"+

		"come to me and prings me pread and salt yesterday,\n"+
		"look you, and bid me eat my leek: it was in place\n"+
		"where I could not breed no contention with him; but\n"+
		"I will be so bold as to wear it in my cap till I see\n"+
		"him once again, and then I will tell him a little\n"+
		"piece of my desires.\n"+
		"Enter PISTOL\n"+
		"GOWER\n"+
		"Why, here he comes, swelling like a turkey-cock.\n"+
		"FLUELLEN\n"+

		"GOWER\n"+
		"Enough, captain: you have astonished him.\n"+
		"FLUELLEN\n"+
		"I say, I will make him eat some part of my leek, or\n"+
		"I will peat his pate four days. Bite, I pray you; it\n"+

		"PISTOL\n"+
		"Must I bite?\n"+
		"FLUELLEN\n"+
		"Yes, certainly, and out of doubt and out of question\n"+

		"any of your words? I have seen you gleeking and\n"+

		"Which you before so urged, lies in his answer.\n"+
		"KING OF FRANCE\n"+
		"I have but with a cursorary eye\n"+
		"O'erglanced the articles: pleaseth your grace\n"+
		"To appoint some of your council presently\n"+
		"To sit with us once more, with better heed\n"+
		"To re-survey them, we will suddenly\n"+
		"Pass our accept and peremptory answer.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Brother, we shall. Go, uncle Exeter,\n"+
		"And brother Clarence, and you, brother Gloucester,\n"+
		"Warwick and Huntingdon, go with the king;\n"+
		"And take with you free power to ratify,\n"+
		"Augment, or alter, as your wisdoms best\n"+
		"Shall see advantageable for our dignity,\n"+
		"Any thing in or out of our demands,\n"+
		"And we'll consign thereto. Will you, fair sister,\n"+
		"Go with the princes, or stay here with us?\n"+
		"QUEEN ISABEL\n"+
		"Our gracious brother, I will go with them:\n"+
		"Haply a woman's voice may do some good,\n"+
		"When articles too nicely urged be stood on.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Yet leave our cousin Katharine here with us:\n"+
		"She is our capital demand, comprised\n"+
		"Within the fore-rank of our articles.\n"+
		"QUEEN ISABEL\n"+
		"She hath good leave.\n"+
		"Exeunt all except HENRY, KATHARINE, and ALICE\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Fair Katharine, and most fair,\n"+
		"Will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms\n"+
		"Such as will enter at a lady's ear\n"+
		"And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?\n"+
		"KATHARINE\n"+
		"Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with\n"+
		"your French heart, I will be glad to hear you\n"+
		"confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do\n"+
		"you like me, Kate?\n"+
		"KATHARINE\n"+
		"Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is 'like me.'\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.\n"+
		"KATHARINE\n"+
		"Que dit-il? que je suis semblable a les anges?\n"+
		"ALICE\n"+
		"Oui, vraiment, sauf votre grace, ainsi dit-il.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"I said so, dear Katharine; and I must not blush to\n"+
		"affirm it.\n"+
		"KATHARINE\n"+
		"O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de\n"+
		"tromperies.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"What says she, fair one? that the tongues of men\n"+
		"are full of deceits?\n"+
		"ALICE\n"+
		"Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of\n"+
		"deceits: dat is de princess.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"The princess is the better Englishwoman. I' faith,\n"+
		"Kate, my wooing is fit for thy understanding: I am\n"+
		"glad thou canst speak no better English; for, if\n"+
		"thou couldst, thou wouldst find me such a plain king\n"+
		"that thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my\n"+
		"crown. I know no ways to mince it in love, but\n"+
		"directly to say 'I love you:' then if you urge me\n"+
		"farther than to say 'do you in faith?' I wear out\n"+
		"my suit. Give me your answer; i' faith, do: and so\n"+
		"clap hands and a bargain: how say you, lady?\n"+
		"KATHARINE\n"+
		"Sauf votre honneur, me understand vell.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Marry, if you would put me to verses or to dance for\n"+
		"your sake, Kate, why you undid me: for the one, I\n"+
		"have neither words nor measure, and for the other, I\n"+
		"have no strength in measure, yet a reasonable\n"+
		"measure in strength. If I could win a lady at\n"+
		"leap-frog, or by vaulting into my saddle with my\n"+
		"armour on my back, under the correction of bragging\n"+
		"be it spoken. I should quickly leap into a wife.\n"+
		"Or if I might buffet for my love, or bound my horse\n"+
		"for her favours, I could lay on like a butcher and\n"+
		"sit like a jack-an-apes, never off. But, before God,\n"+
		"Kate, I cannot look greenly nor gasp out my\n"+
		"eloquence, nor I have no cunning in protestation;\n"+
		"only downright oaths, which I never use till urged,\n"+
		"nor never break for urging. If thou canst love a\n"+
		"fellow of this temper, Kate, whose face is not worth\n"+
		"sun-burning, that never looks in his glass for love\n"+
		"of any thing he sees there, let thine eye be thy\n"+
		"cook. I speak to thee plain soldier: If thou canst\n"+
		"love me for this, take me: if not, to say to thee\n"+
		"that I shall die, is true; but for thy love, by the\n"+
		"Lord, no; yet I love thee too. And while thou\n"+
		"livest, dear Kate, take a fellow of plain and\n"+
		"uncoined constancy; for he perforce must do thee\n"+
		"right, because he hath not the gift to woo in other\n"+
		"places: for these fellows of infinite tongue, that\n"+
		"can rhyme themselves into ladies' favours, they do\n"+
		"always reason themselves out again. What! a\n"+
		"speaker is but a prater; a rhyme is but a ballad. A\n"+
		"good leg will fall; a straight back will stoop; a\n"+
		"black beard will turn white; a curled pate will grow\n"+
		"bald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will wax\n"+
		"hollow: but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the\n"+
		"moon; or, rather, the sun, and not the moon; for it\n"+
		"shines bright and never changes, but keeps his\n"+
		"course truly. If thou would have such a one, take\n"+
		"me; and take me, take a soldier; take a soldier,\n"+
		"take a king. And what sayest thou then to my love?\n"+
		"speak, my fair, and fairly, I pray thee.\n"+
		"KATHARINE\n"+
		"Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France?\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"No; it is not possible you should love the enemy of\n"+
		"France, Kate: but, in loving me, you should love\n"+
		"the friend of France; for I love France so well that\n"+
		"I will not part with a village of it; I will have it\n"+
		"all mine: and, Kate, when France is mine and I am\n"+
		"yours, then yours is France and you are mine.\n"+
		"KATHARINE\n"+
		"I cannot tell vat is dat.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"No, Kate? I will tell thee in French; which I am\n"+
		"sure will hang upon my tongue like a new-married\n"+
		"wife about her husband's neck, hardly to be shook\n"+
		"off. Je quand sur le possession de France, et quand\n"+
		"vous avez le possession de moi,--let me see, what\n"+
		"then? Saint Denis be my speed!--donc votre est\n"+
		"France et vous etes mienne. It is as easy for me,\n"+
		"Kate, to conquer the kingdom as to speak so much\n"+
		"more French: I shall never move thee in French,\n"+
		"unless it be to laugh at me.\n"+
		"KATHARINE\n"+
		"Sauf votre honneur, le Francois que vous parlez, il\n"+
		"est meilleur que l'Anglois lequel je parle.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"No, faith, is't not, Kate: but thy speaking of my\n"+
		"tongue, and I thine, most truly-falsely, must needs\n"+
		"be granted to be much at one. But, Kate, dost thou\n"+
		"understand thus much English, canst thou love me?\n"+
		"KATHARINE\n"+
		"I cannot tell.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Can any of your neighbours tell, Kate? I'll ask\n"+
		"them. Come, I know thou lovest me: and at night,\n"+
		"when you come into your closet, you'll question this\n"+
		"gentlewoman about me; and I know, Kate, you will to\n"+
		"her dispraise those parts in me that you love with\n"+
		"your heart: but, good Kate, mock me mercifully; the\n"+
		"rather, gentle princess, because I love thee\n"+
		"cruelly. If ever thou beest mine, Kate, as I have a\n"+
		"saving faith within me tells me thou shalt, I get\n"+
		"thee with scambling, and thou must therefore needs\n"+
		"prove a good soldier-breeder: shall not thou and I,\n"+
		"between Saint Denis and Saint George, compound a\n"+
		"boy, half French, half English, that shall go to\n"+
		"Constantinople and take the Turk by the beard?\n"+
		"shall we not? what sayest thou, my fair\n"+
		"flower-de-luce?\n"+
		"KATHARINE\n"+
		"I do not know dat\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"No; 'tis hereafter to know, but now to promise: do\n"+
		"but now promise, Kate, you will endeavour for your\n"+
		"French part of such a boy; and for my English moiety\n"+
		"take the word of a king and a bachelor. How answer\n"+
		"you, la plus belle Katharine du monde, mon tres cher\n"+
		"et devin deesse?\n"+
		"KATHARINE\n"+
		"Your majestee ave fausse French enough to deceive de\n"+
		"most sage demoiselle dat is en France.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Now, fie upon my false French! By mine honour, in\n"+
		"true English, I love thee, Kate: by which honour I\n"+
		"dare not swear thou lovest me; yet my blood begins to\n"+
		"flatter me that thou dost, notwithstanding the poor\n"+
		"and untempering effect of my visage. Now, beshrew\n"+
		"my father's ambition! he was thinking of civil wars\n"+
		"when he got me: therefore was I created with a\n"+
		"stubborn outside, with an aspect of iron, that, when\n"+
		"I come to woo ladies, I fright them. But, in faith,\n"+
		"Kate, the elder I wax, the better I shall appear:\n"+
		"my comfort is, that old age, that ill layer up of\n"+
		"beauty, can do no more, spoil upon my face: thou\n"+
		"hast me, if thou hast me, at the worst; and thou\n"+
		"shalt wear me, if thou wear me, better and better:\n"+
		"and therefore tell me, most fair Katharine, will you\n"+
		"have me? Put off your maiden blushes; avouch the\n"+
		"thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress;\n"+
		"take me by the hand, and say 'Harry of England I am\n"+
		"thine:' which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine\n"+
		"ear withal, but I will tell thee aloud 'England is\n"+
		"thine, Ireland is thine, France is thine, and Harry\n"+
		"Plantagenet is thine;' who though I speak it before\n"+
		"his face, if he be not fellow with the best king,\n"+
		"thou shalt find the best king of good fellows.\n"+
		"Come, your answer in broken music; for thy voice is\n"+
		"music and thy English broken; therefore, queen of\n"+
		"all, Katharine, break thy mind to me in broken\n"+
		"English; wilt thou have me?\n"+
		"KATHARINE\n"+
		"Dat is as it sall please de roi mon pere.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Nay, it will please him well, Kate it shall please\n"+
		"him, Kate.\n"+
		"KATHARINE\n"+
		"Den it sall also content me.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Upon that I kiss your hand, and I call you my queen.\n"+
		"KATHARINE\n"+
		"Laissez, mon seigneur, laissez, laissez: ma foi, je\n"+
		"ne veux point que vous abaissiez votre grandeur en\n"+
		"baisant la main d'une de votre seigeurie indigne\n"+
		"serviteur; excusez-moi, je vous supplie, mon\n"+
		"tres-puissant seigneur.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Then I will kiss your lips, Kate.\n"+
		"KATHARINE\n"+
		"Les dames et demoiselles pour etre baisees devant\n"+
		"leur noces, il n'est pas la coutume de France.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Madam my interpreter, what says she?\n"+
		"ALICE\n"+
		"Dat it is not be de fashion pour les ladies of\n"+
		"France,--I cannot tell vat is baiser en Anglish.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"To kiss.\n"+
		"ALICE\n"+
		"Your majesty entendre bettre que moi.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"It is not a fashion for the maids in France to kiss\n"+
		"before they are married, would she say?\n"+
		"ALICE\n"+
		"Oui, vraiment.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"O Kate, nice customs curtsy to great kings. Dear\n"+
		"Kate, you and I cannot be confined within the weak\n"+
		"list of a country's fashion: we are the makers of\n"+
		"manners, Kate; and the liberty that follows our\n"+
		"places stops the mouth of all find-faults; as I will\n"+
		"do yours, for upholding the nice fashion of your\n"+
		"country in denying me a kiss: therefore, patiently\n"+
		"and yielding.\n"+
		"Kissing her\n"+
		"You have witchcraft in your lips, Kate: there is\n"+
		"more eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the\n"+
		"tongues of the French council; and they should\n"+
		"sooner persuade Harry of England than a general\n"+
		"petition of monarchs. Here comes your father.\n"+
		"Re-enter the FRENCH KING and his QUEEN, BURGUNDY, and other Lords\n"+
		"BURGUNDY\n"+
		"God save your majesty! my royal cousin, teach you\n"+
		"our princess English?\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"I would have her learn, my fair cousin, how\n"+
		"perfectly I love her; and that is good English.\n"+
		"BURGUNDY\n"+
		"Is she not apt?\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Our tongue is rough, coz, and my condition is not\n"+
		"smooth; so that, having neither the voice nor the\n"+
		"heart of flattery about me, I cannot so conjure up\n"+
		"the spirit of love in her, that he will appear in\n"+
		"his true likeness.\n"+
		"BURGUNDY\n"+
		"Pardon the frankness of my mirth, if I answer you\n"+
		"for that. If you would conjure in her, you must\n"+
		"make a circle; if conjure up love in her in his true\n"+
		"likeness, he must appear naked and blind. Can you\n"+
		"blame her then, being a maid yet rosed over with the\n"+
		"virgin crimson of modesty, if she deny the\n"+
		"appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing\n"+
		"self? It were, my lord, a hard condition for a maid\n"+
		"to consign to.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Yet they do wink and yield, as love is blind and enforces.\n"+
		"BURGUNDY\n"+
		"They are then excused, my lord, when they see not\n"+
		"what they do.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Then, good my lord, teach your cousin to consent winking.\n"+
		"BURGUNDY\n"+
		"I will wink on her to consent, my lord, if you will\n"+
		"teach her to know my meaning: for maids, well\n"+
		"summered and warm kept, are like flies at\n"+
		"Bartholomew-tide, blind, though they have their\n"+
		"eyes; and then they will endure handling, which\n"+
		"before would not abide looking on.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"This moral ties me over to time and a hot summer;\n"+
		"and so I shall catch the fly, your cousin, in the\n"+
		"latter end and she must be blind too.\n"+
		"BURGUNDY\n"+
		"As love is, my lord, before it loves.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"It is so: and you may, some of you, thank love for\n"+
		"my blindness, who cannot see many a fair French city\n"+
		"for one fair French maid that stands in my way.\n"+
		"FRENCH KING\n"+
		"Yes, my lord, you see them perspectively, the cities\n"+
		"turned into a maid; for they are all girdled with\n"+
		"maiden walls that war hath never entered.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Shall Kate be my wife?\n"+
		"FRENCH KING\n"+
		"So please you.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"I am content; so the maiden cities you talk of may\n"+
		"wait on her: so the maid that stood in the way for\n"+
		"my wish shall show me the way to my will.\n"+
		"FRENCH KING\n"+
		"We have consented to all terms of reason.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Is't so, my lords of England?\n"+
		"WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"The king hath granted every article:\n"+
		"His daughter first, and then in sequel all,\n"+
		"According to their firm proposed natures.\n"+
		"EXETER\n"+
		"Only he hath not yet subscribed this:\n"+
		"Where your majesty demands, that the King of France,\n"+
		"having any occasion to write for matter of grant,\n"+
		"shall name your highness in this form and with this\n"+
		"addition in French, Notre trescher fils Henri, Roi\n"+
		"d'Angleterre, Heritier de France; and thus in\n"+
		"Latin, Praeclarissimus filius noster Henricus, Rex\n"+
		"Angliae, et Haeres Franciae.\n"+
		"FRENCH KING\n"+
		"Nor this I have not, brother, so denied,\n"+
		"But your request shall make me let it pass.\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"I pray you then, in love and dear alliance,\n"+
		"Let that one article rank with the rest;\n"+
		"And thereupon give me your daughter.\n"+
		"FRENCH KING\n"+
		"Take her, fair son, and from her blood raise up\n"+
		"Issue to me; that the contending kingdoms\n"+
		"Of France and England, whose very shores look pale\n"+
		"With envy of each other's happiness,\n"+
		"May cease their hatred, and this dear conjunction\n"+
		"Plant neighbourhood and Christian-like accord\n"+
		"In their sweet bosoms, that never war advance\n"+
		"His bleeding sword 'twixt England and fair France.\n"+
		"ALL\n"+
		"Amen!\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Now, welcome, Kate: and bear me witness all,\n"+
		"That here I kiss her as my sovereign queen.\n"+
		"Flourish\n"+
		"QUEEN ISABEL\n"+
		"God, the best maker of all marriages,\n"+
		"Combine your hearts in one, your realms in one!\n"+
		"As man and wife, being two, are one in love,\n"+
		"So be there 'twixt your kingdoms such a spousal,\n"+
		"That never may ill office, or fell jealousy,\n"+
		"Which troubles oft the bed of blessed marriage,\n"+
		"Thrust in between the paction of these kingdoms,\n"+
		"To make divorce of their incorporate league;\n"+
		"That English may as French, French Englishmen,\n"+
		"Receive each other. God speak this Amen!\n"+
		"ALL\n"+
		"Amen!\n"+
		"KING HENRY V\n"+
		"Prepare we for our marriage--on which day,\n"+
		"My Lord of Burgundy, we'll take your oath,\n"+
		"And all the peers', for surety of our leagues.\n"+
		"Then shall I swear to Kate, and you to me;\n"+
		"And may our oaths well kept and prosperous be!\n"+

		"Chorus\n"+
		"Thus far, with rough and all-unable pen,\n"+
