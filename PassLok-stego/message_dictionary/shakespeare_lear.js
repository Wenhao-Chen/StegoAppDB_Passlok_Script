		"King Lear\n"+
		"ACT I\n"+
		"SCENE I. King Lear's palace.\n"+
		"Enter KENT, GLOUCESTER, and EDMUND\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"I thought the king had more affected the Duke of\n"+
		"Albany than Cornwall.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"It did always seem so to us: but now, in the\n"+
		"division of the kingdom, it appears not which of\n"+
		"the dukes he values most; for equalities are so\n"+
		"weighed, that curiosity in neither can make choice\n"+
		"of either's moiety.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"Is not this your son, my lord?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: I have\n"+
		"so often blushed to acknowledge him, that now I am\n"+
		"brazed to it.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"I cannot conceive you.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Sir, this young fellow's mother could: whereupon\n"+
		"she grew round-wombed, and had, indeed, sir, a son\n"+
		"for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed.\n"+
		"Do you smell a fault?\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it\n"+
		"being so proper.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year\n"+
		"elder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account:\n"+
		"though this knave came something saucily into the\n"+
		"world before he was sent for, yet was his mother\n"+
		"fair; there was good sport at his making, and the\n"+
		"whoreson must be acknowledged. Do you know this\n"+
		"noble gentleman, Edmund?\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"No, my lord.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"My lord of Kent: remember him hereafter as my\n"+
		"honourable friend.\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"My services to your lordship.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"I must love you, and sue to know you better.\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"Sir, I shall study deserving.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"He hath been out nine years, and away he shall\n"+
		"again. The king is coming.\n"+
		"Sennet. Enter KING LEAR, CORNWALL, ALBANY, GONERIL, REGAN, CORDELIA, and Attendants\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Attend the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"I shall, my liege.\n"+
		"Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EDMUND\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.\n"+
		"Give me the map there. Know that we have divided\n"+
		"In three our kingdom: and 'tis our fast intent\n"+
		"To shake all cares and business from our age;\n"+
		"Conferring them on younger strengths, while we\n"+
		"Unburthen'd crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,\n"+
		"And you, our no less loving son of Albany,\n"+
		"We have this hour a constant will to publish\n"+
		"Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife\n"+
		"May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,\n"+
		"Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,\n"+
		"Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,\n"+
		"And here are to be answer'd. Tell me, my daughters,--\n"+
		"Since now we will divest us both of rule,\n"+
		"Interest of territory, cares of state,--\n"+
		"Which of you shall we say doth love us most?\n"+
		"That we our largest bounty may extend\n"+
		"Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,\n"+
		"Our eldest-born, speak first.\n"+
		"GONERIL\n"+
		"Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter;\n"+
		"Dearer than eye-sight, space, and liberty;\n"+
		"Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare;\n"+
		"No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;\n"+
		"As much as child e'er loved, or father found;\n"+
		"A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable;\n"+
		"Beyond all manner of so much I love you.\n"+
		"CORDELIA\n"+
		"[Aside] What shall Cordelia do?\n"+
		"Love, and be silent.\n"+
		"LEAR\n"+
		"Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,\n"+
		"With shadowy forests and with champains rich'd,\n"+
		"With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,\n"+
		"We make thee lady: to thine and Albany's issue\n"+
		"Be this perpetual. What says our second daughter,\n"+
		"Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak.\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"Sir, I am made\n"+
		"Of the self-same metal that my sister is,\n"+
		"And prize me at her worth. In my true heart\n"+
		"I find she names my very deed of love;\n"+
		"Only she comes too short: that I profess\n"+
		"Myself an enemy to all other joys,\n"+
		"Which the most precious square of sense possesses;\n"+
		"And find I am alone felicitate\n"+
		"In your dear highness' love.\n"+
		"CORDELIA\n"+
		"[Aside] Then poor Cordelia!\n"+
		"And yet not so; since, I am sure, my love's\n"+
		"More richer than my tongue.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"To thee and thine hereditary ever\n"+
		"Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom;\n"+
		"No less in space, validity, and pleasure,\n"+
		"Than that conferr'd on Goneril. Now, our joy,\n"+
		"Although the last, not least; to whose young love\n"+
		"The vines of France and milk of Burgundy\n"+
		"Strive to be interess'd; what can you say to draw\n"+
		"A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.\n"+
		"CORDELIA\n"+
		"Nothing, my lord.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Nothing!\n"+
		"CORDELIA\n"+
		"Nothing.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Nothing will come of nothing: speak again.\n"+
		"CORDELIA\n"+
		"Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave\n"+
		"My heart into my mouth: I love your majesty\n"+
		"According to my bond; nor more nor less.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"How, how, Cordelia! mend your speech a little,\n"+
		"Lest it may mar your fortunes.\n"+
		"CORDELIA\n"+
		"Good my lord,\n"+
		"You have begot me, bred me, loved me: I\n"+
		"Return those duties back as are right fit,\n"+
		"Obey you, love you, and most honour you.\n"+
		"Why have my sisters husbands, if they say\n"+
		"They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,\n"+
		"That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry\n"+
		"Half my love with him, half my care and duty:\n"+
		"Sure, I shall never marry like my sisters,\n"+
		"To love my father all.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"But goes thy heart with this?\n"+
		"CORDELIA\n"+
		"Ay, good my lord.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"So young, and so untender?\n"+
		"CORDELIA\n"+
		"So young, my lord, and true.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Let it be so; thy truth, then, be thy dower:\n"+
		"For, by the sacred radiance of the sun,\n"+
		"The mysteries of Hecate, and the night;\n"+
		"By all the operation of the orbs\n"+
		"From whom we do exist, and cease to be;\n"+
		"Here I disclaim all my paternal care,\n"+
		"Propinquity and property of blood,\n"+
		"And as a stranger to my heart and me\n"+
		"Hold thee, from this, for ever. The barbarous Scythian,\n"+
		"Or he that makes his generation messes\n"+
		"To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom\n"+
		"Be as well neighbour'd, pitied, and relieved,\n"+
		"As thou my sometime daughter.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"Good my liege,--\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Peace, Kent!\n"+
		"Come not between the dragon and his wrath.\n"+
		"I loved her most, and thought to set my rest\n"+
		"On her kind nursery. Hence, and avoid my sight!\n"+
		"So be my grave my peace, as here I give\n"+
		"Her father's heart from her! Call France; who stirs?\n"+
		"Call Burgundy. Cornwall and Albany,\n"+
		"With my two daughters' dowers digest this third:\n"+
		"Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.\n"+
		"I do invest you jointly with my power,\n"+
		"Pre-eminence, and all the large effects\n"+
		"That troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course,\n"+
		"With reservation of an hundred knights,\n"+
		"By you to be sustain'd, shall our abode\n"+
		"Make with you by due turns. Only we still retain\n"+
		"The name, and all the additions to a king;\n"+
		"The sway, revenue, execution of the rest,\n"+
		"Beloved sons, be yours: which to confirm,\n"+
		"This coronet part betwixt you.\n"+
		"Giving the crown\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"Royal Lear,\n"+
		"Whom I have ever honour'd as my king,\n"+
		"Loved as my father, as my master follow'd,\n"+
		"As my great patron thought on in my prayers,--\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"The bow is bent and drawn, make from the shaft.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"Let it fall rather, though the fork invade\n"+
		"The region of my heart: be Kent unmannerly,\n"+
		"When Lear is mad. What wilt thou do, old man?\n"+
		"Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak,\n"+
		"When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour's bound,\n"+
		"When majesty stoops to folly. Reverse thy doom;\n"+
		"And, in thy best consideration, cheque\n"+
		"This hideous rashness: answer my life my judgment,\n"+
		"Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least;\n"+
		"Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound\n"+
		"Reverbs no hollowness.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Kent, on thy life, no more.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"My life I never held but as a pawn\n"+
		"To wage against thy enemies; nor fear to lose it,\n"+
		"Thy safety being the motive.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Out of my sight!\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"See better, Lear; and let me still remain\n"+
		"The true blank of thine eye.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Now, by Apollo,--\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"Now, by Apollo, king,\n"+
		"Thou swear'st thy gods in vain.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"O, vassal! miscreant!\n"+
		"Laying his hand on his sword\n"+
		"ALBANY\n"+
		"CORNWALL\n"+
		"Dear sir, forbear.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"Do:\n"+
		"Kill thy physician, and the fee bestow\n"+
		"Upon thy foul disease. Revoke thy doom;\n"+
		"Or, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat,\n"+
		"I'll tell thee thou dost evil.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Hear me, recreant!\n"+
		"On thine allegiance, hear me!\n"+
		"Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow,\n"+
		"Which we durst never yet, and with strain'd pride\n"+
		"To come between our sentence and our power,\n"+
		"Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,\n"+
		"Our potency made good, take thy reward.\n"+
		"Five days we do allot thee, for provision\n"+
		"To shield thee from diseases of the world;\n"+
		"And on the sixth to turn thy hated back\n"+
		"Upon our kingdom: if, on the tenth day following,\n"+
		"Thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions,\n"+
		"The moment is thy death. Away! by Jupiter,\n"+
		"This shall not be revoked.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"Fare thee well, king: sith thus thou wilt appear,\n"+
		"Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here.\n"+
		"To CORDELIA\n"+
		"The gods to their dear shelter take thee, maid,\n"+
		"That justly think'st, and hast most rightly said!\n"+
		"To REGAN and GONERIL\n"+
		"And your large speeches may your deeds approve,\n"+
		"That good effects may spring from words of love.\n"+
		"Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu;\n"+
		"He'll shape his old course in a country new.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"Flourish. Re-enter GLOUCESTER, with KING OF FRANCE, BURGUNDY, and Attendants\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Here's France and Burgundy, my noble lord.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"My lord of Burgundy.\n"+
		"We first address towards you, who with this king\n"+
		"Hath rivall'd for our daughter: what, in the least,\n"+
		"Will you require in present dower with her,\n"+
		"Or cease your quest of love?\n"+
		"BURGUNDY\n"+
		"Most royal majesty,\n"+
		"I crave no more than what your highness offer'd,\n"+
		"Nor will you tender less.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Right noble Burgundy,\n"+
		"When she was dear to us, we did hold her so;\n"+
		"But now her price is fall'n. Sir, there she stands:\n"+
		"If aught within that little seeming substance,\n"+
		"Or all of it, with our displeasure pieced,\n"+
		"And nothing more, may fitly like your grace,\n"+
		"She's there, and she is yours.\n"+
		"BURGUNDY\n"+
		"I know no answer.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Will you, with those infirmities she owes,\n"+
		"Unfriended, new-adopted to our hate,\n"+
		"Dower'd with our curse, and stranger'd with our oath,\n"+
		"Take her, or leave her?\n"+
		"BURGUNDY\n"+
		"Pardon me, royal sir;\n"+
		"Election makes not up on such conditions.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Then leave her, sir; for, by the power that made me,\n"+
		"I tell you all her wealth.\n"+
		"To KING OF FRANCE\n"+
		"For you, great king,\n"+
		"I would not from your love make such a stray,\n"+
		"To match you where I hate; therefore beseech you\n"+
		"To avert your liking a more worthier way\n"+
		"Than on a wretch whom nature is ashamed\n"+
		"Almost to acknowledge hers.\n"+
		"KING OF FRANCE\n"+
		"This is most strange,\n"+
		"That she, that even but now was your best object,\n"+
		"The argument of your praise, balm of your age,\n"+
		"Most best, most dearest, should in this trice of time\n"+
		"Commit a thing so monstrous, to dismantle\n"+
		"So many folds of favour. Sure, her offence\n"+
		"Must be of such unnatural degree,\n"+
		"That monsters it, or your fore-vouch'd affection\n"+
		"Fall'n into taint: which to believe of her,\n"+
		"Must be a faith that reason without miracle\n"+
		"Could never plant in me.\n"+
		"CORDELIA\n"+
		"I yet beseech your majesty,--\n"+
		"If for I want that glib and oily art,\n"+
		"To speak and purpose not; since what I well intend,\n"+
		"I'll do't before I speak,--that you make known\n"+
		"It is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness,\n"+
		"No unchaste action, or dishonour'd step,\n"+
		"That hath deprived me of your grace and favour;\n"+
		"But even for want of that for which I am richer,\n"+
		"A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue\n"+
		"As I am glad I have not, though not to have it\n"+
		"Hath lost me in your liking.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Better thou\n"+
		"Hadst not been born than not to have pleased me better.\n"+
		"KING OF FRANCE\n"+
		"Is it but this,--a tardiness in nature\n"+
		"Which often leaves the history unspoke\n"+
		"That it intends to do? My lord of Burgundy,\n"+
		"What say you to the lady? Love's not love\n"+
		"When it is mingled with regards that stand\n"+
		"Aloof from the entire point. Will you have her?\n"+
		"She is herself a dowry.\n"+
		"BURGUNDY\n"+
		"Royal Lear,\n"+
		"Give but that portion which yourself proposed,\n"+
		"And here I take Cordelia by the hand,\n"+
		"Duchess of Burgundy.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Nothing: I have sworn; I am firm.\n"+
		"BURGUNDY\n"+
		"I am sorry, then, you have so lost a father\n"+
		"That you must lose a husband.\n"+
		"CORDELIA\n"+
		"Peace be with Burgundy!\n"+
		"Since that respects of fortune are his love,\n"+
		"I shall not be his wife.\n"+
		"KING OF FRANCE\n"+
		"Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor;\n"+
		"Most choice, forsaken; and most loved, despised!\n"+
		"Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon:\n"+
		"Be it lawful I take up what's cast away.\n"+
		"Gods, gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect\n"+
		"My love should kindle to inflamed respect.\n"+
		"Thy dowerless daughter, king, thrown to my chance,\n"+
		"Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France:\n"+
		"Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy\n"+
		"Can buy this unprized precious maid of me.\n"+
		"Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind:\n"+
		"Thou losest here, a better where to find.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Thou hast her, France: let her be thine; for we\n"+
		"Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see\n"+
		"That face of hers again. Therefore be gone\n"+
		"Without our grace, our love, our benison.\n"+
		"Come, noble Burgundy.\n"+
		"Flourish. Exeunt all but KING OF FRANCE, GONERIL, REGAN, and CORDELIA\n"+
		"KING OF FRANCE\n"+
		"Bid farewell to your sisters.\n"+
		"CORDELIA\n"+
		"The jewels of our father, with wash'd eyes\n"+
		"Cordelia leaves you: I know you what you are;\n"+
		"And like a sister am most loath to call\n"+
		"Your faults as they are named. Use well our father:\n"+
		"To your professed bosoms I commit him\n"+
		"But yet, alas, stood I within his grace,\n"+
		"I would prefer him to a better place.\n"+
		"So, farewell to you both.\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"Prescribe not us our duties.\n"+
		"GONERIL\n"+
		"Let your study\n"+
		"Be to content your lord, who hath received you\n"+
		"At fortune's alms. You have obedience scanted,\n"+
		"And well are worth the want that you have wanted.\n"+
		"CORDELIA\n"+
		"Time shall unfold what plaited cunning hides:\n"+
		"Who cover faults, at last shame them derides.\n"+
		"Well may you prosper!\n"+
		"KING OF FRANCE\n"+
		"Come, my fair Cordelia.\n"+
		"Exeunt KING OF FRANCE and CORDELIA\n"+
		"GONERIL\n"+
		"Sister, it is not a little I have to say of what\n"+
		"most nearly appertains to us both. I think our\n"+
		"father will hence to-night.\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"That's most certain, and with you; next month with us.\n"+
		"GONERIL\n"+
		"You see how full of changes his age is; the\n"+
		"observation we have made of it hath not been\n"+
		"little: he always loved our sister most; and\n"+
		"with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off\n"+
		"appears too grossly.\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"'Tis the infirmity of his age: yet he hath ever\n"+
		"but slenderly known himself.\n"+
		"GONERIL\n"+
		"The best and soundest of his time hath been but\n"+
		"rash; then must we look to receive from his age,\n"+
		"not alone the imperfections of long-engraffed\n"+
		"condition, but therewithal the unruly waywardness\n"+
		"that infirm and choleric years bring with them.\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"Such unconstant starts are we like to have from\n"+
		"him as this of Kent's banishment.\n"+
		"GONERIL\n"+
		"There is further compliment of leavetaking\n"+
		"between France and him. Pray you, let's hit\n"+
		"together: if our father carry authority with\n"+
		"such dispositions as he bears, this last\n"+
		"surrender of his will but offend us.\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"We shall further think on't.\n"+
		"GONERIL\n"+
		"We must do something, and i' the heat.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. The Earl of Gloucester's castle.\n"+
		"Enter EDMUND, with a letter\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"Thou, nature, art my goddess; to thy law\n"+
		"My services are bound. Wherefore should I\n"+
		"Stand in the plague of custom, and permit\n"+
		"The curiosity of nations to deprive me,\n"+
		"For that I am some twelve or fourteen moon-shines\n"+
		"Lag of a brother? Why bastard? wherefore base?\n"+
		"When my dimensions are as well compact,\n"+
		"My mind as generous, and my shape as true,\n"+
		"As honest madam's issue? Why brand they us\n"+
		"With base? with baseness? bastardy? base, base?\n"+
		"Who, in the lusty stealth of nature, take\n"+
		"More composition and fierce quality\n"+
		"Than doth, within a dull, stale, tired bed,\n"+
		"Go to the creating a whole tribe of fops,\n"+
		"Got 'tween asleep and wake? Well, then,\n"+
		"Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land:\n"+
		"Our father's love is to the bastard Edmund\n"+
		"As to the legitimate: fine word,--legitimate!\n"+
		"Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed,\n"+
		"And my invention thrive, Edmund the base\n"+
		"Shall top the legitimate. I grow; I prosper:\n"+
		"Now, gods, stand up for bastards!\n"+
		"Enter GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Kent banish'd thus! and France in choler parted!\n"+
		"And the king gone to-night! subscribed his power!\n"+
		"Confined to exhibition! All this done\n"+
		"Upon the gad! Edmund, how now! what news?\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"So please your lordship, none.\n"+
		"Putting up the letter\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter?\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"I know no news, my lord.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"What paper were you reading?\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"Nothing, my lord.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"No? What needed, then, that terrible dispatch of\n"+
		"it into your pocket? the quality of nothing hath\n"+
		"not such need to hide itself. Let's see: come,\n"+
		"if it be nothing, I shall not need spectacles.\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"I beseech you, sir, pardon me: it is a letter\n"+
		"from my brother, that I have not all o'er-read;\n"+
		"and for so much as I have perused, I find it not\n"+
		"fit for your o'er-looking.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Give me the letter, sir.\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"I shall offend, either to detain or give it. The\n"+
		"contents, as in part I understand them, are to blame.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Let's see, let's see.\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"I hope, for my brother's justification, he wrote\n"+
		"this but as an essay or taste of my virtue.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"[Reads] 'This policy and reverence of age makes\n"+
		"the world bitter to the best of our times; keeps\n"+
		"our fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relish\n"+
		"them. I begin to find an idle and fond bondage\n"+
		"in the oppression of aged tyranny; who sways, not\n"+
		"as it hath power, but as it is suffered. Come to\n"+
		"me, that of this I may speak more. If our father\n"+
		"would sleep till I waked him, you should half his\n"+
		"revenue for ever, and live the beloved of your\n"+
		"brother, EDGAR.'\n"+
		"Hum--conspiracy!--'Sleep till I waked him,--you\n"+
		"should enjoy half his revenue,'--My son Edgar!\n"+
		"Had he a hand to write this? a heart and brain\n"+
		"to breed it in?--When came this to you? who\n"+
		"brought it?\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"It was not brought me, my lord; there's the\n"+
		"cunning of it; I found it thrown in at the\n"+
		"casement of my closet.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"You know the character to be your brother's?\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear\n"+
		"it were his; but, in respect of that, I would\n"+
		"fain think it were not.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"It is his.\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"It is his hand, my lord; but I hope his heart is\n"+
		"not in the contents.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Hath he never heretofore sounded you in this business?\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"Never, my lord: but I have heard him oft\n"+
		"maintain it to be fit, that, sons at perfect age,\n"+
		"and fathers declining, the father should be as\n"+
		"ward to the son, and the son manage his revenue.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"O villain, villain! His very opinion in the\n"+
		"letter! Abhorred villain! Unnatural, detested,\n"+
		"brutish villain! worse than brutish! Go, sirrah,\n"+
		"seek him; I'll apprehend him: abominable villain!\n"+
		"Where is he?\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"I do not well know, my lord. If it shall please\n"+
		"you to suspend your indignation against my\n"+
		"brother till you can derive from him better\n"+
		"testimony of his intent, you shall run a certain\n"+
		"course; where, if you violently proceed against\n"+
		"him, mistaking his purpose, it would make a great\n"+
		"gap in your own honour, and shake in pieces the\n"+
		"heart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my life\n"+
		"for him, that he hath wrote this to feel my\n"+
		"affection to your honour, and to no further\n"+
		"pretence of danger.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Think you so?\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"If your honour judge it meet, I will place you\n"+
		"where you shall hear us confer of this, and by an\n"+
		"auricular assurance have your satisfaction; and\n"+
		"that without any further delay than this very evening.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"He cannot be such a monster--\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"Nor is not, sure.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"To his father, that so tenderly and entirely\n"+
		"loves him. Heaven and earth! Edmund, seek him\n"+
		"out: wind me into him, I pray you: frame the\n"+
		"business after your own wisdom. I would unstate\n"+
		"myself, to be in a due resolution.\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"I will seek him, sir, presently: convey the\n"+
		"business as I shall find means and acquaint you withal.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend\n"+
		"no good to us: though the wisdom of nature can\n"+
		"reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itself\n"+
		"scourged by the sequent effects: love cools,\n"+
		"friendship falls off, brothers divide: in\n"+
		"cities, mutinies; in countries, discord; in\n"+
		"palaces, treason; and the bond cracked 'twixt son\n"+
		"and father. This villain of mine comes under the\n"+
		"prediction; there's son against father: the king\n"+
		"falls from bias of nature; there's father against\n"+
		"child. We have seen the best of our time:\n"+
		"machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all\n"+
		"ruinous disorders, follow us disquietly to our\n"+
		"graves. Find out this villain, Edmund; it shall\n"+
		"lose thee nothing; do it carefully. And the\n"+
		"noble and true-hearted Kent banished! his\n"+
		"offence, honesty! 'Tis strange.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"This is the excellent foppery of the world, that,\n"+
		"when we are sick in fortune,--often the surfeit\n"+
		"of our own behavior,--we make guilty of our\n"+
		"disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars: as\n"+
		"if we were villains by necessity; fools by\n"+
		"heavenly compulsion; knaves, thieves, and\n"+
		"treachers, by spherical predominance; drunkards,\n"+
		"liars, and adulterers, by an enforced obedience of\n"+
		"planetary influence; and all that we are evil in,\n"+
		"by a divine thrusting on: an admirable evasion\n"+
		"of whoremaster man, to lay his goatish\n"+
		"disposition to the charge of a star! My\n"+
		"father compounded with my mother under the\n"+
		"dragon's tail; and my nativity was under Ursa\n"+
		"major; so that it follows, I am rough and\n"+
		"lecherous. Tut, I should have been that I am,\n"+
		"had the maidenliest star in the firmament\n"+
		"twinkled on my bastardizing. Edgar--\n"+
		"Enter EDGAR\n"+
		"And pat he comes like the catastrophe of the old\n"+
		"comedy: my cue is villanous melancholy, with a\n"+
		"sigh like Tom o' Bedlam. O, these eclipses do\n"+
		"portend these divisions! fa, sol, la, mi.\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"How now, brother Edmund! what serious\n"+
		"contemplation are you in?\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"I am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read\n"+
		"this other day, what should follow these eclipses.\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"Do you busy yourself about that?\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"I promise you, the effects he writes of succeed\n"+
		"unhappily; as of unnaturalness between the child\n"+
		"and the parent; death, dearth, dissolutions of\n"+
		"ancient amities; divisions in state, menaces and\n"+
		"maledictions against king and nobles; needless\n"+
		"diffidences, banishment of friends, dissipation\n"+
		"of cohorts, nuptial breaches, and I know not what.\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"How long have you been a sectary astronomical?\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"Come, come; when saw you my father last?\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"Why, the night gone by.\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"Spake you with him?\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"Ay, two hours together.\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"Parted you in good terms? Found you no\n"+
		"displeasure in him by word or countenance?\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"None at all.\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended\n"+
		"him: and at my entreaty forbear his presence\n"+
		"till some little time hath qualified the heat of\n"+
		"his displeasure; which at this instant so rageth\n"+
		"in him, that with the mischief of your person it\n"+
		"would scarcely allay.\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"Some villain hath done me wrong.\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"That's my fear. I pray you, have a continent\n"+
		"forbearance till the spied of his rage goes\n"+
		"slower; and, as I say, retire with me to my\n"+
		"lodging, from whence I will fitly bring you to\n"+
		"hear my lord speak: pray ye, go; there's my key:\n"+
		"if you do stir abroad, go armed.\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"Armed, brother!\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"Brother, I advise you to the best; go armed: I\n"+
		"am no honest man if there be any good meaning\n"+
		"towards you: I have told you what I have seen\n"+
		"and heard; but faintly, nothing like the image\n"+
		"and horror of it: pray you, away.\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"Shall I hear from you anon?\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"I do serve you in this business.\n"+
		"Exit EDGAR\n"+
		"A credulous father! and a brother noble,\n"+
		"Whose nature is so far from doing harms,\n"+
		"That he suspects none: on whose foolish honesty\n"+
		"My practises ride easy! I see the business.\n"+
		"Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit:\n"+
		"All with me's meet that I can fashion fit.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE III. The Duke of Albany's palace.\n"+
		"Enter GONERIL, and OSWALD, her steward\n"+
		"GONERIL\n"+
		"Did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool?\n"+
		"OSWALD\n"+
		"Yes, madam.\n"+
		"GONERIL\n"+
		"By day and night he wrongs me; every hour\n"+
		"He flashes into one gross crime or other,\n"+
		"That sets us all at odds: I'll not endure it:\n"+
		"His knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids us\n"+
		"On every trifle. When he returns from hunting,\n"+
		"I will not speak with him; say I am sick:\n"+
		"If you come slack of former services,\n"+
		"You shall do well; the fault of it I'll answer.\n"+
		"OSWALD\n"+
		"He's coming, madam; I hear him.\n"+
		"Horns within\n"+
		"GONERIL\n"+
		"Put on what weary negligence you please,\n"+
		"You and your fellows; I'll have it come to question:\n"+
		"If he dislike it, let him to our sister,\n"+
		"Whose mind and mine, I know, in that are one,\n"+
		"Not to be over-ruled. Idle old man,\n"+
		"That still would manage those authorities\n"+
		"That he hath given away! Now, by my life,\n"+
		"Old fools are babes again; and must be used\n"+
		"With cheques as flatteries,--when they are seen abused.\n"+
		"Remember what I tell you.\n"+
		"OSWALD\n"+
		"Well, madam.\n"+
		"GONERIL\n"+
		"And let his knights have colder looks among you;\n"+
		"What grows of it, no matter; advise your fellows so:\n"+
		"I would breed from hence occasions, and I shall,\n"+
		"That I may speak: I'll write straight to my sister,\n"+
		"To hold my very course. Prepare for dinner.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV. A hall in the same.\n"+
		"Enter KENT, disguised\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"If but as well I other accents borrow,\n"+
		"That can my speech defuse, my good intent\n"+
		"May carry through itself to that full issue\n"+
		"For which I razed my likeness. Now, banish'd Kent,\n"+
		"If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemn'd,\n"+
		"So may it come, thy master, whom thou lovest,\n"+
		"Shall find thee full of labours.\n"+
		"Horns within. Enter KING LEAR, Knights, and Attendants\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Let me not stay a jot for dinner; go get it ready.\n"+
		"Exit an Attendant\n"+
		"How now! what art thou?\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"A man, sir.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"What dost thou profess? what wouldst thou with us?\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"I do profess to be no less than I seem; to serve\n"+
		"him truly that will put me in trust: to love him\n"+
		"that is honest; to converse with him that is wise,\n"+
		"and says little; to fear judgment; to fight when I\n"+
		"cannot choose; and to eat no fish.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"What art thou?\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"A very honest-hearted fellow, and as poor as the king.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"If thou be as poor for a subject as he is for a\n"+
		"king, thou art poor enough. What wouldst thou?\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"Service.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Who wouldst thou serve?\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"You.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Dost thou know me, fellow?\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"No, sir; but you have that in your countenance\n"+
		"which I would fain call master.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"What's that?\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"Authority.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"What services canst thou do?\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"I can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a curious\n"+
		"tale in telling it, and deliver a plain message\n"+
		"bluntly: that which ordinary men are fit for, I am\n"+
		"qualified in; and the best of me is diligence.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"How old art thou?\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"Not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing, nor\n"+
		"so old to dote on her for any thing: I have years\n"+
		"on my back forty eight.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Follow me; thou shalt serve me: if I like thee no\n"+
		"worse after dinner, I will not part from thee yet.\n"+
		"Dinner, ho, dinner! Where's my knave? my fool?\n"+
		"Go you, and call my fool hither.\n"+
		"Exit an Attendant\n"+
		"Enter OSWALD\n"+
		"You, you, sirrah, where's my daughter?\n"+
		"OSWALD\n"+
		"So please you,--\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"What says the fellow there? Call the clotpoll back.\n"+
		"Exit a Knight\n"+
		"Where's my fool, ho? I think the world's asleep.\n"+
		"Re-enter Knight\n"+
		"How now! where's that mongrel?\n"+
		"Knight\n"+
		"He says, my lord, your daughter is not well.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Why came not the slave back to me when I called him.\n"+
		"Knight\n"+
		"Sir, he answered me in the roundest manner, he would\n"+
		"not.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"He would not!\n"+
		"Knight\n"+
		"My lord, I know not what the matter is; but, to my\n"+
		"judgment, your highness is not entertained with that\n"+
		"ceremonious affection as you were wont; there's a\n"+
		"great abatement of kindness appears as well in the\n"+
		"general dependants as in the duke himself also and\n"+
		"your daughter.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Ha! sayest thou so?\n"+
		"Knight\n"+
		"I beseech you, pardon me, my lord, if I be mistaken;\n"+
		"for my duty cannot be silent when I think your\n"+
		"highness wronged.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Thou but rememberest me of mine own conception: I\n"+
		"have perceived a most faint neglect of late; which I\n"+
		"have rather blamed as mine own jealous curiosity\n"+
		"than as a very pretence and purpose of unkindness:\n"+
		"I will look further into't. But where's my fool? I\n"+
		"have not seen him this two days.\n"+
		"Knight\n"+
		"Since my young lady's going into France, sir, the\n"+
		"fool hath much pined away.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"No more of that; I have noted it well. Go you, and\n"+
		"tell my daughter I would speak with her.\n"+
		"Exit an Attendant\n"+
		"Go you, call hither my fool.\n"+
		"Exit an Attendant\n"+
		"Re-enter OSWALD\n"+
		"O, you sir, you, come you hither, sir: who am I,\n"+
		"sir?\n"+
		"OSWALD\n"+
		"My lady's father.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"'My lady's father'! my lord's knave: your\n"+
		"whoreson dog! you slave! you cur!\n"+
		"OSWALD\n"+
		"I am none of these, my lord; I beseech your pardon.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Do you bandy looks with me, you rascal?\n"+
		"Striking him\n"+
		"OSWALD\n"+
		"I'll not be struck, my lord.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"Nor tripped neither, you base football player.\n"+
		"Tripping up his heels\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"I thank thee, fellow; thou servest me, and I'll\n"+
		"love thee.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"Come, sir, arise, away! I'll teach you differences:\n"+
		"away, away! if you will measure your lubber's\n"+
		"length again, tarry: but away! go to; have you\n"+
		"wisdom? so.\n"+
		"Pushes OSWALD out\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Now, my friendly knave, I thank thee: there's\n"+
		"earnest of thy service.\n"+
		"Giving KENT money\n"+
		"Enter Fool\n"+
		"Fool\n"+
		"Let me hire him too: here's my coxcomb.\n"+
		"Offering KENT his cap\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"How now, my pretty knave! how dost thou?\n"+
		"Fool\n"+
		"Sirrah, you were best take my coxcomb.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"Why, fool?\n"+
		"Fool\n"+
		"Why, for taking one's part that's out of favour:\n"+
		"nay, an thou canst not smile as the wind sits,\n"+
		"thou'lt catch cold shortly: there, take my coxcomb:\n"+
		"why, this fellow has banished two on's daughters,\n"+
		"and did the third a blessing against his will; if\n"+
		"thou follow him, thou must needs wear my coxcomb.\n"+
		"How now, nuncle! Would I had two coxcombs and two daughters!\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Why, my boy?\n"+
		"Fool\n"+
		"If I gave them all my living, I'ld keep my coxcombs\n"+
		"myself. There's mine; beg another of thy daughters.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Take heed, sirrah; the whip.\n"+
		"Fool\n"+
		"Truth's a dog must to kennel; he must be whipped\n"+
		"out, when Lady the brach may stand by the fire and stink.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"A pestilent gall to me!\n"+
		"Fool\n"+
		"Sirrah, I'll teach thee a speech.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Do.\n"+
		"Fool\n"+
		"Mark it, nuncle:\n"+
		"Have more than thou showest,\n"+
		"Speak less than thou knowest,\n"+
		"Lend less than thou owest,\n"+
		"Ride more than thou goest,\n"+
		"Learn more than thou trowest,\n"+
		"Set less than thou throwest;\n"+
		"Leave thy drink and thy whore,\n"+
		"And keep in-a-door,\n"+
		"And thou shalt have more\n"+
		"Than two tens to a score.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"This is nothing, fool.\n"+
		"Fool\n"+
		"Then 'tis like the breath of an unfee'd lawyer; you\n"+
		"gave me nothing for't. Can you make no use of\n"+
		"nothing, nuncle?\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Why, no, boy; nothing can be made out of nothing.\n"+
		"Fool\n"+
		"[To KENT] Prithee, tell him, so much the rent of\n"+
		"his land comes to: he will not believe a fool.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"A bitter fool!\n"+
		"Fool\n"+
		"Dost thou know the difference, my boy, between a\n"+
		"bitter fool and a sweet fool?\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"No, lad; teach me.\n"+
		"Fool\n"+
		"That lord that counsell'd thee\n"+
		"To give away thy land,\n"+
		"Come place him here by me,\n"+
		"Do thou for him stand:\n"+
		"The sweet and bitter fool\n"+
		"Will presently appear;\n"+
		"The one in motley here,\n"+
		"The other found out there.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Dost thou call me fool, boy?\n"+
		"Fool\n"+
		"All thy other titles thou hast given away; that\n"+
		"thou wast born with.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"This is not altogether fool, my lord.\n"+
		"Fool\n"+
		"No, faith, lords and great men will not let me; if\n"+
		"I had a monopoly out, they would have part on't:\n"+
		"and ladies too, they will not let me have all fool\n"+
		"to myself; they'll be snatching. Give me an egg,\n"+
		"nuncle, and I'll give thee two crowns.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"What two crowns shall they be?\n"+
		"Fool\n"+
		"Why, after I have cut the egg i' the middle, and eat\n"+
		"up the meat, the two crowns of the egg. When thou\n"+
		"clovest thy crown i' the middle, and gavest away\n"+
		"both parts, thou borest thy ass on thy back o'er\n"+
		"the dirt: thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown,\n"+
		"when thou gavest thy golden one away. If I speak\n"+
		"like myself in this, let him be whipped that first\n"+
		"finds it so.\n"+
		"Singing\n"+
		"Fools had ne'er less wit in a year;\n"+
		"For wise men are grown foppish,\n"+
		"They know not how their wits to wear,\n"+
		"Their manners are so apish.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"When were you wont to be so full of songs, sirrah?\n"+
		"Fool\n"+
		"I have used it, nuncle, ever since thou madest thy\n"+
		"daughters thy mothers: for when thou gavest them\n"+
		"the rod, and put'st down thine own breeches,\n"+
		"Singing\n"+
		"Then they for sudden joy did weep,\n"+
		"And I for sorrow sung,\n"+
		"That such a king should play bo-peep,\n"+
		"And go the fools among.\n"+
		"Prithee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach\n"+
		"thy fool to lie: I would fain learn to lie.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"An you lie, sirrah, we'll have you whipped.\n"+
		"Fool\n"+
		"I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are:\n"+
		"they'll have me whipped for speaking true, thou'lt\n"+
		"have me whipped for lying; and sometimes I am\n"+
		"whipped for holding my peace. I had rather be any\n"+
		"kind o' thing than a fool: and yet I would not be\n"+
		"thee, nuncle; thou hast pared thy wit o' both sides,\n"+
		"and left nothing i' the middle: here comes one o'\n"+
		"the parings.\n"+
		"Enter GONERIL\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"How now, daughter! what makes that frontlet on?\n"+
		"Methinks you are too much of late i' the frown.\n"+
		"Fool\n"+
		"Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to\n"+
		"care for her frowning; now thou art an O without a\n"+
		"figure: I am better than thou art now; I am a fool,\n"+
		"thou art nothing.\n"+
		"To GONERIL\n"+
		"Yes, forsooth, I will hold my tongue; so your face\n"+
		"bids me, though you say nothing. Mum, mum,\n"+
		"He that keeps nor crust nor crum,\n"+
		"Weary of all, shall want some.\n"+
		"Pointing to KING LEAR\n"+
		"That's a shealed peascod.\n"+
		"GONERIL\n"+
		"Not only, sir, this your all-licensed fool,\n"+
		"But other of your insolent retinue\n"+
		"Do hourly carp and quarrel; breaking forth\n"+
		"In rank and not-to-be endured riots. Sir,\n"+
		"I had thought, by making this well known unto you,\n"+
		"To have found a safe redress; but now grow fearful,\n"+
		"By what yourself too late have spoke and done.\n"+
		"That you protect this course, and put it on\n"+
		"By your allowance; which if you should, the fault\n"+
		"Would not 'scape censure, nor the redresses sleep,\n"+
		"Which, in the tender of a wholesome weal,\n"+
		"Might in their working do you that offence,\n"+
		"Which else were shame, that then necessity\n"+
		"Will call discreet proceeding.\n"+
		"Fool\n"+
		"For, you trow, nuncle,\n"+
		"The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long,\n"+
		"That it's had it head bit off by it young.\n"+
		"So, out went the candle, and we were left darkling.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Are you our daughter?\n"+
		"GONERIL\n"+
		"Come, sir,\n"+
		"I would you would make use of that good wisdom,\n"+
		"Whereof I know you are fraught; and put away\n"+
		"These dispositions, that of late transform you\n"+
		"From what you rightly are.\n"+
		"Fool\n"+
		"May not an ass know when the cart\n"+
		"draws the horse? Whoop, Jug! I love thee.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Doth any here know me? This is not Lear:\n"+
		"Doth Lear walk thus? speak thus? Where are his eyes?\n"+
		"Either his notion weakens, his discernings\n"+
		"Are lethargied--Ha! waking? 'tis not so.\n"+
		"Who is it that can tell me who I am?\n"+
		"Fool\n"+
		"Lear's shadow.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"I would learn that; for, by the\n"+
		"marks of sovereignty, knowledge, and reason,\n"+
		"I should be false persuaded I had daughters.\n"+
		"Fool\n"+
		"Which they will make an obedient father.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Your name, fair gentlewoman?\n"+
		"GONERIL\n"+
		"This admiration, sir, is much o' the savour\n"+
		"Of other your new pranks. I do beseech you\n"+
		"To understand my purposes aright:\n"+
		"As you are old and reverend, you should be wise.\n"+
		"Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires;\n"+
		"Men so disorder'd, so debosh'd and bold,\n"+
		"That this our court, infected with their manners,\n"+
		"Shows like a riotous inn: epicurism and lust\n"+
		"Make it more like a tavern or a brothel\n"+
		"Than a graced palace. The shame itself doth speak\n"+
		"For instant remedy: be then desired\n"+
		"By her, that else will take the thing she begs,\n"+
		"A little to disquantity your train;\n"+
		"And the remainder, that shall still depend,\n"+
		"To be such men as may besort your age,\n"+
		"And know themselves and you.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Darkness and devils!\n"+
		"Saddle my horses; call my train together:\n"+
		"Degenerate bastard! I'll not trouble thee.\n"+
		"Yet have I left a daughter.\n"+
		"GONERIL\n"+
		"You strike my people; and your disorder'd rabble\n"+
		"Make servants of their betters.\n"+
		"Enter ALBANY\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Woe, that too late repents,--\n"+
		"To ALBANY\n"+
		"O, sir, are you come?\n"+
		"Is it your will? Speak, sir. Prepare my horses.\n"+
		"Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend,\n"+
		"More hideous when thou show'st thee in a child\n"+
		"Than the sea-monster!\n"+
		"ALBANY\n"+
		"Pray, sir, be patient.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"[To GONERIL] Detested kite! thou liest.\n"+
		"My train are men of choice and rarest parts,\n"+
		"That all particulars of duty know,\n"+
		"And in the most exact regard support\n"+
		"The worships of their name. O most small fault,\n"+
		"How ugly didst thou in Cordelia show!\n"+
		"That, like an engine, wrench'd my frame of nature\n"+
		"From the fix'd place; drew from heart all love,\n"+
		"And added to the gall. O Lear, Lear, Lear!\n"+

		"To make this creature fruitful!\n"+
		"Into her womb convey sterility!\n"+
		"Dry up in her the organs of increase;\n"+
		"And from her derogate body never spring\n"+
		"A babe to honour her! If she must teem,\n"+
		"Create her child of spleen; that it may live,\n"+
		"And be a thwart disnatured torment to her!\n"+
		"Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth;\n"+
		"With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks;\n"+

		"I'll tell thee:\n"+

		"Life and death! I am ashamed\n"+
		"That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus;\n"+
		"That these hot tears, which break from me perforce,\n"+

		"ALBANY\n"+
		"I cannot be so partial, Goneril,\n"+
		"To the great love I bear you,--\n"+
		"GONERIL\n"+
		"Pray you, content. What, Oswald, ho!\n"+
		"To the Fool\n"+
		"You, sir, more knave than fool, after your master.\n"+
		"Fool\n"+

		"GONERIL\n"+
		"Take you some company, and away to horse:\n"+

		"Exit OSWALD\n"+
		"No, no, my lord,\n"+
		"This milky gentleness and course of yours\n"+
		"Though I condemn not, yet, under pardon,\n"+
		"You are much more attask'd for want of wisdom\n"+

		"Ay, boy.\n"+
		"Fool\n"+
		"Then, I prithee, be merry; thy wit shall ne'er go\n"+
		"slip-shod.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Ha, ha, ha!\n"+
		"Fool\n"+
		"Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly;\n"+
		"for though she's as like this as a crab's like an\n"+
		"apple, yet I can tell what I can tell.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Why, what canst thou tell, my boy?\n"+
		"Fool\n"+
		"She will taste as like this as a crab does to a\n"+
		"crab. Thou canst tell why one's nose stands i'\n"+
		"the middle on's face?\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"No.\n"+
		"Fool\n"+
		"Why, to keep one's eyes of either side's nose; that\n"+
		"what a man cannot smell out, he may spy into.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"I did her wrong--\n"+
		"Fool\n"+
		"Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell?\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"No.\n"+
		"Fool\n"+
		"Nor I neither; but I can tell why a snail has a house.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Why?\n"+
		"Fool\n"+
		"Why, to put his head in; not to give it away to his\n"+
		"daughters, and leave his horns without a case.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"I will forget my nature. So kind a father! Be my\n"+
		"horses ready?\n"+
		"Fool\n"+
		"Thy asses are gone about 'em. The reason why the\n"+

		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Because they are not eight?\n"+
		"Fool\n"+
		"Yes, indeed: thou wouldst make a good fool.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"To take 't again perforce! Monster ingratitude!\n"+
		"Fool\n"+

		"How's that?\n"+

		"EDMUND\n"+
		"Save thee, Curan.\n"+
		"CURAN\n"+
		"And you, sir. I have been with your father, and\n"+
		"given him notice that the Duke of Cornwall and Regan\n"+
		"his duchess will be here with him this night.\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"How comes that?\n"+
		"CURAN\n"+
		"Nay, I know not. You have heard of the news abroad;\n"+
		"I mean the whispered ones, for they are yet but\n"+
		"ear-kissing arguments?\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"Not I pray you, what are they?\n"+
		"CURAN\n"+
		"Have you heard of no likely wars toward, 'twixt the\n"+
		"Dukes of Cornwall and Albany?\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"Not a word.\n"+
		"CURAN\n"+
		"You may do, then, in time. Fare you well, sir.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"The duke be here to-night? The better! best!\n"+
		"This weaves itself perforce into my business.\n"+
		"My father hath set guard to take my brother;\n"+
		"And I have one thing, of a queasy question,\n"+
		"Which I must act: briefness and fortune, work!\n"+
		"Brother, a word; descend: brother, I say!\n"+
		"Enter EDGAR\n"+
		"My father watches: O sir, fly this place;\n"+
		"Intelligence is given where you are hid;\n"+
		"You have now the good advantage of the night:\n"+
		"Have you not spoken 'gainst the Duke of Cornwall?\n"+
		"He's coming hither: now, i' the night, i' the haste,\n"+
		"And Regan with him: have you nothing said\n"+
		"Upon his party 'gainst the Duke of Albany?\n"+
		"Advise yourself.\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"I am sure on't, not a word.\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"I hear my father coming: pardon me:\n"+
		"In cunning I must draw my sword upon you\n"+
		"Draw; seem to defend yourself; now quit you well.\n"+
		"Yield: come before my father. Light, ho, here!\n"+
		"Fly, brother. Torches, torches! So, farewell.\n"+
		"Exit EDGAR\n"+
		"Some blood drawn on me would beget opinion.\n"+
		"Wounds his arm\n"+
		"Of my more fierce endeavour: I have seen drunkards\n"+
		"Do more than this in sport. Father, father!\n"+
		"Stop, stop! No help?\n"+
		"Enter GLOUCESTER, and Servants with torches\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Now, Edmund, where's the villain?\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out,\n"+
		"Mumbling of wicked charms, conjuring the moon\n"+
		"To stand auspicious mistress,--\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"But where is he?\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"Look, sir, I bleed.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Where is the villain, Edmund?\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"Fled this way, sir. When by no means he could--\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Pursue him, ho! Go after.\n"+
		"Exeunt some Servants\n"+
		"By no means what?\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"Persuade me to the murder of your lordship;\n"+
		"But that I told him, the revenging gods\n"+
		"'Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend;\n"+
		"Spoke, with how manifold and strong a bond\n"+
		"The child was bound to the father; sir, in fine,\n"+
		"Seeing how loathly opposite I stood\n"+
		"To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion,\n"+
		"With his prepared sword, he charges home\n"+
		"My unprovided body, lanced mine arm:\n"+
		"But when he saw my best alarum'd spirits,\n"+
		"Bold in the quarrel's right, roused to the encounter,\n"+
		"Or whether gasted by the noise I made,\n"+
		"Full suddenly he fled.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Let him fly far:\n"+
		"Not in this land shall he remain uncaught;\n"+
		"And found--dispatch. The noble duke my master,\n"+
		"My worthy arch and patron, comes to-night:\n"+
		"By his authority I will proclaim it,\n"+
		"That he which finds him shall deserve our thanks,\n"+
		"Bringing the murderous coward to the stake;\n"+
		"He that conceals him, death.\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"When I dissuaded him from his intent,\n"+
		"And found him pight to do it, with curst speech\n"+
		"I threaten'd to discover him: he replied,\n"+
		"'Thou unpossessing bastard! dost thou think,\n"+
		"If I would stand against thee, would the reposal\n"+
		"Of any trust, virtue, or worth in thee\n"+
		"Make thy words faith'd? No: what I should deny,--\n"+
		"As this I would: ay, though thou didst produce\n"+
		"My very character,--I'ld turn it all\n"+
		"To thy suggestion, plot, and damned practise:\n"+
		"And thou must make a dullard of the world,\n"+
		"If they not thought the profits of my death\n"+
		"Were very pregnant and potential spurs\n"+
		"To make thee seek it.'\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Strong and fasten'd villain\n"+
		"Would he deny his letter? I never got him.\n"+
		"Tucket within\n"+
		"Hark, the duke's trumpets! I know not why he comes.\n"+
		"All ports I'll bar; the villain shall not 'scape;\n"+
		"The duke must grant me that: besides, his picture\n"+
		"I will send far and near, that all the kingdom\n"+
		"May have the due note of him; and of my land,\n"+
		"Loyal and natural boy, I'll work the means\n"+
		"To make thee capable.\n"+
		"Enter CORNWALL, REGAN, and Attendants\n"+
		"CORNWALL\n"+
		"How now, my noble friend! since I came hither,\n"+
		"Which I can call but now, I have heard strange news.\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"If it be true, all vengeance comes too short\n"+
		"Which can pursue the offender. How dost, my lord?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"O, madam, my old heart is crack'd, it's crack'd!\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"What, did my father's godson seek your life?\n"+
		"He whom my father named? your Edgar?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"O, lady, lady, shame would have it hid!\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"Was he not companion with the riotous knights\n"+
		"That tend upon my father?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"I know not, madam: 'tis too bad, too bad.\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"Yes, madam, he was of that consort.\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"No marvel, then, though he were ill affected:\n"+
		"'Tis they have put him on the old man's death,\n"+
		"To have the expense and waste of his revenues.\n"+
		"I have this present evening from my sister\n"+
		"Been well inform'd of them; and with such cautions,\n"+
		"That if they come to sojourn at my house,\n"+
		"I'll not be there.\n"+
		"CORNWALL\n"+
		"Nor I, assure thee, Regan.\n"+
		"Edmund, I hear that you have shown your father\n"+
		"A child-like office.\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"'Twas my duty, sir.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"He did bewray his practise; and received\n"+
		"This hurt you see, striving to apprehend him.\n"+
		"CORNWALL\n"+
		"Is he pursued?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Ay, my good lord.\n"+
		"CORNWALL\n"+
		"If he be taken, he shall never more\n"+
		"Be fear'd of doing harm: make your own purpose,\n"+
		"How in my strength you please. For you, Edmund,\n"+
		"Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant\n"+
		"So much commend itself, you shall be ours:\n"+
		"Natures of such deep trust we shall much need;\n"+
		"You we first seize on.\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"I shall serve you, sir,\n"+
		"Truly, however else.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"For him I thank your grace.\n"+
		"CORNWALL\n"+
		"You know not why we came to visit you,--\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"Thus out of season, threading dark-eyed night:\n"+
		"Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise,\n"+
		"Wherein we must have use of your advice:\n"+
		"Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister,\n"+
		"Of differences, which I least thought it fit\n"+
		"To answer from our home; the several messengers\n"+
		"From hence attend dispatch. Our good old friend,\n"+
		"Lay comforts to your bosom; and bestow\n"+
		"Your needful counsel to our business,\n"+
		"Which craves the instant use.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"I serve you, madam:\n"+
		"Your graces are right welcome.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. Before Gloucester's castle.\n"+
		"Enter KENT and OSWALD, severally\n"+
		"OSWALD\n"+
		"Good dawning to thee, friend: art of this house?\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"Ay.\n"+
		"OSWALD\n"+
		"Where may we set our horses?\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"I' the mire.\n"+
		"OSWALD\n"+
		"Prithee, if thou lovest me, tell me.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"I love thee not.\n"+
		"OSWALD\n"+
		"Why, then, I care not for thee.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"If I had thee in Lipsbury pinfold, I would make thee\n"+
		"care for me.\n"+
		"OSWALD\n"+
		"Why dost thou use me thus? I know thee not.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"Fellow, I know thee.\n"+
		"OSWALD\n"+
		"What dost thou know me for?\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"A knave; a rascal; an eater of broken meats; a\n"+
		"base, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited,\n"+
		"hundred-pound, filthy, worsted-stocking knave; a\n"+
		"lily-livered, action-taking knave, a whoreson,\n"+
		"glass-gazing, super-serviceable finical rogue;\n"+
		"one-trunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a\n"+
		"bawd, in way of good service, and art nothing but\n"+
		"the composition of a knave, beggar, coward, pandar,\n"+
		"and the son and heir of a mongrel bitch: one whom I\n"+
		"will beat into clamorous whining, if thou deniest\n"+
		"the least syllable of thy addition.\n"+
		"OSWALD\n"+
		"Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to rail\n"+
		"on one that is neither known of thee nor knows thee!\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"What a brazen-faced varlet art thou, to deny thou\n"+
		"knowest me! Is it two days ago since I tripped up\n"+
		"thy heels, and beat thee before the king? Draw, you\n"+
		"rogue: for, though it be night, yet the moon\n"+
		"shines; I'll make a sop o' the moonshine of you:\n"+
		"draw, you whoreson cullionly barber-monger, draw.\n"+
		"Drawing his sword\n"+
		"OSWALD\n"+
		"Away! I have nothing to do with thee.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"Draw, you rascal: you come with letters against the\n"+
		"king; and take vanity the puppet's part against the\n"+
		"royalty of her father: draw, you rogue, or I'll so\n"+
		"carbonado your shanks: draw, you rascal; come your ways.\n"+
		"OSWALD\n"+
		"Help, ho! murder! help!\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"Strike, you slave; stand, rogue, stand; you neat\n"+
		"slave, strike.\n"+
		"Beating him\n"+
		"OSWALD\n"+
		"Help, ho! murder! murder!\n"+
		"Enter EDMUND, with his rapier drawn, CORNWALL, REGAN, GLOUCESTER, and Servants\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"How now! What's the matter?\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"With you, goodman boy, an you please: come, I'll\n"+
		"flesh ye; come on, young master.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Weapons! arms! What 's the matter here?\n"+
		"CORNWALL\n"+
		"Keep peace, upon your lives:\n"+
		"He dies that strikes again. What is the matter?\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"The messengers from our sister and the king.\n"+
		"CORNWALL\n"+
		"What is your difference? speak.\n"+
		"OSWALD\n"+
		"I am scarce in breath, my lord.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"No marvel, you have so bestirred your valour. You\n"+
		"cowardly rascal, nature disclaims in thee: a\n"+
		"tailor made thee.\n"+
		"CORNWALL\n"+
		"Thou art a strange fellow: a tailor make a man?\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"Ay, a tailor, sir: a stone-cutter or painter could\n"+
		"not have made him so ill, though he had been but two\n"+
		"hours at the trade.\n"+
		"CORNWALL\n"+
		"Speak yet, how grew your quarrel?\n"+
		"OSWALD\n"+
		"This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have spared\n"+
		"at suit of his gray beard,--\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"Thou whoreson zed! thou unnecessary letter! My\n"+
		"lord, if you will give me leave, I will tread this\n"+
		"unbolted villain into mortar, and daub the wall of\n"+
		"a jakes with him. Spare my gray beard, you wagtail?\n"+
		"CORNWALL\n"+
		"Peace, sirrah!\n"+
		"You beastly knave, know you no reverence?\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"Yes, sir; but anger hath a privilege.\n"+
		"CORNWALL\n"+
		"Why art thou angry?\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"That such a slave as this should wear a sword,\n"+
		"Who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these,\n"+
		"Like rats, oft bite the holy cords a-twain\n"+
		"Which are too intrinse t' unloose; smooth every passion\n"+
		"That in the natures of their lords rebel;\n"+
		"Bring oil to fire, snow to their colder moods;\n"+
		"Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks\n"+
		"With every gale and vary of their masters,\n"+
		"Knowing nought, like dogs, but following.\n"+
		"A plague upon your epileptic visage!\n"+
		"Smile you my speeches, as I were a fool?\n"+
		"Goose, if I had you upon Sarum plain,\n"+
		"I'ld drive ye cackling home to Camelot.\n"+
		"CORNWALL\n"+
		"Why, art thou mad, old fellow?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"How fell you out? say that.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"No contraries hold more antipathy\n"+
		"Than I and such a knave.\n"+
		"CORNWALL\n"+
		"Why dost thou call him a knave? What's his offence?\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"His countenance likes me not.\n"+
		"CORNWALL\n"+
		"No more, perchance, does mine, nor his, nor hers.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"Sir, 'tis my occupation to be plain:\n"+
		"I have seen better faces in my time\n"+
		"Than stands on any shoulder that I see\n"+
		"Before me at this instant.\n"+
		"CORNWALL\n"+
		"This is some fellow,\n"+
		"Who, having been praised for bluntness, doth affect\n"+
		"A saucy roughness, and constrains the garb\n"+
		"Quite from his nature: he cannot flatter, he,\n"+
		"An honest mind and plain, he must speak truth!\n"+
		"An they will take it, so; if not, he's plain.\n"+
		"These kind of knaves I know, which in this plainness\n"+
		"Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends\n"+
		"Than twenty silly ducking observants\n"+
		"That stretch their duties nicely.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"Sir, in good sooth, in sincere verity,\n"+
		"Under the allowance of your great aspect,\n"+
		"Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire\n"+
		"On flickering Phoebus' front,--\n"+
		"CORNWALL\n"+
		"What mean'st by this?\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"To go out of my dialect, which you\n"+
		"discommend so much. I know, sir, I am no\n"+
		"flatterer: he that beguiled you in a plain\n"+
		"accent was a plain knave; which for my part\n"+
		"I will not be, though I should win your displeasure\n"+
		"to entreat me to 't.\n"+
		"CORNWALL\n"+
		"What was the offence you gave him?\n"+
		"OSWALD\n"+
		"I never gave him any:\n"+
		"It pleased the king his master very late\n"+
		"To strike at me, upon his misconstruction;\n"+
		"When he, conjunct and flattering his displeasure,\n"+
		"Tripp'd me behind; being down, insulted, rail'd,\n"+
		"And put upon him such a deal of man,\n"+
		"That worthied him, got praises of the king\n"+
		"For him attempting who was self-subdued;\n"+
		"And, in the fleshment of this dread exploit,\n"+
		"Drew on me here again.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"None of these rogues and cowards\n"+
		"But Ajax is their fool.\n"+
		"CORNWALL\n"+
		"Fetch forth the stocks!\n"+
		"You stubborn ancient knave, you reverend braggart,\n"+
		"We'll teach you--\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"Sir, I am too old to learn:\n"+
		"Call not your stocks for me: I serve the king;\n"+
		"On whose employment I was sent to you:\n"+
		"You shall do small respect, show too bold malice\n"+
		"Against the grace and person of my master,\n"+
		"Stocking his messenger.\n"+
		"CORNWALL\n"+
		"Fetch forth the stocks! As I have life and honour,\n"+
		"There shall he sit till noon.\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"Till noon! till night, my lord; and all night too.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"Why, madam, if I were your father's dog,\n"+
		"You should not use me so.\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"Sir, being his knave, I will.\n"+
		"CORNWALL\n"+
		"This is a fellow of the self-same colour\n"+
		"Our sister speaks of. Come, bring away the stocks!\n"+
		"Stocks brought out\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Let me beseech your grace not to do so:\n"+
		"His fault is much, and the good king his master\n"+
		"Will cheque him for 't: your purposed low correction\n"+
		"Is such as basest and contemned'st wretches\n"+
		"For pilferings and most common trespasses\n"+
		"Are punish'd with: the king must take it ill,\n"+
		"That he's so slightly valued in his messenger,\n"+
		"Should have him thus restrain'd.\n"+
		"CORNWALL\n"+
		"I'll answer that.\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"My sister may receive it much more worse,\n"+
		"To have her gentleman abused, assaulted,\n"+
		"For following her affairs. Put in his legs.\n"+
		"KENT is put in the stocks\n"+
		"Come, my good lord, away.\n"+
		"Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER and KENT\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"I am sorry for thee, friend; 'tis the duke's pleasure,\n"+
		"Whose disposition, all the world well knows,\n"+
		"Will not be rubb'd nor stopp'd: I'll entreat for thee.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"Pray, do not, sir: I have watched and travell'd hard;\n"+
		"Some time I shall sleep out, the rest I'll whistle.\n"+
		"A good man's fortune may grow out at heels:\n"+
		"Give you good morrow!\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"The duke's to blame in this; 'twill be ill taken.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"Good king, that must approve the common saw,\n"+
		"Thou out of heaven's benediction comest\n"+
		"To the warm sun!\n"+
		"Approach, thou beacon to this under globe,\n"+
		"That by thy comfortable beams I may\n"+
		"Peruse this letter! Nothing almost sees miracles\n"+
		"But misery: I know 'tis from Cordelia,\n"+
		"Who hath most fortunately been inform'd\n"+
		"Of my obscured course; and shall find time\n"+
		"From this enormous state, seeking to give\n"+
		"Losses their remedies. All weary and o'erwatch'd,\n"+
		"Take vantage, heavy eyes, not to behold\n"+
		"This shameful lodging.\n"+
		"Fortune, good night: smile once more: turn thy wheel!\n"+
		"Sleeps\n"+
		"SCENE III. A wood.\n"+
		"Enter EDGAR\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"I heard myself proclaim'd;\n"+
		"And by the happy hollow of a tree\n"+
		"Escaped the hunt. No port is free; no place,\n"+
		"That guard, and most unusual vigilance,\n"+
		"Does not attend my taking. Whiles I may 'scape,\n"+
		"I will preserve myself: and am bethought\n"+
		"To take the basest and most poorest shape\n"+
		"That ever penury, in contempt of man,\n"+
		"Brought near to beast: my face I'll grime with filth;\n"+
		"Blanket my loins: elf all my hair in knots;\n"+
		"And with presented nakedness out-face\n"+
		"The winds and persecutions of the sky.\n"+
		"The country gives me proof and precedent\n"+
		"Of Bedlam beggars, who, with roaring voices,\n"+
		"Strike in their numb'd and mortified bare arms\n"+
		"Pins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary;\n"+
		"And with this horrible object, from low farms,\n"+
		"Poor pelting villages, sheep-cotes, and mills,\n"+
		"Sometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers,\n"+
		"Enforce their charity. Poor Turlygod! poor Tom!\n"+
		"That's something yet: Edgar I nothing am.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE IV. Before GLOUCESTER's castle. KENT in the stocks.\n"+
		"Enter KING LEAR, Fool, and Gentleman\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"'Tis strange that they should so depart from home,\n"+
		"And not send back my messenger.\n"+
		"Gentleman\n"+
		"As I learn'd,\n"+
		"The night before there was no purpose in them\n"+
		"Of this remove.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"Hail to thee, noble master!\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Ha!\n"+
		"Makest thou this shame thy pastime?\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"No, my lord.\n"+
		"Fool\n"+
		"Ha, ha! he wears cruel garters. Horses are tied\n"+
		"by the heads, dogs and bears by the neck, monkeys by\n"+
		"the loins, and men by the legs: when a man's\n"+
		"over-lusty at legs, then he wears wooden\n"+
		"nether-stocks.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"What's he that hath so much thy place mistook\n"+
		"To set thee here?\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"It is both he and she;\n"+
		"Your son and daughter.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"No.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"Yes.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"No, I say.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"I say, yea.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"No, no, they would not.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"Yes, they have.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"By Jupiter, I swear, no.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"By Juno, I swear, ay.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"They durst not do 't;\n"+
		"They could not, would not do 't; 'tis worse than murder,\n"+
		"To do upon respect such violent outrage:\n"+
		"Resolve me, with all modest haste, which way\n"+
		"Thou mightst deserve, or they impose, this usage,\n"+
		"Coming from us.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"My lord, when at their home\n"+
		"I did commend your highness' letters to them,\n"+
		"Ere I was risen from the place that show'd\n"+
		"My duty kneeling, came there a reeking post,\n"+
		"Stew'd in his haste, half breathless, panting forth\n"+
		"From Goneril his mistress salutations;\n"+
		"Deliver'd letters, spite of intermission,\n"+
		"Which presently they read: on whose contents,\n"+
		"They summon'd up their meiny, straight took horse;\n"+
		"Commanded me to follow, and attend\n"+
		"The leisure of their answer; gave me cold looks:\n"+
		"And meeting here the other messenger,\n"+
		"Whose welcome, I perceived, had poison'd mine,--\n"+
		"Being the very fellow that of late\n"+
		"Display'd so saucily against your highness,--\n"+
		"Having more man than wit about me, drew:\n"+
		"He raised the house with loud and coward cries.\n"+
		"Your son and daughter found this trespass worth\n"+
		"The shame which here it suffers.\n"+
		"Fool\n"+
		"Winter's not gone yet, if the wild-geese fly that way.\n"+
		"Fathers that wear rags\n"+
		"Do make their children blind;\n"+
		"But fathers that bear bags\n"+
		"Shall see their children kind.\n"+
		"Fortune, that arrant whore,\n"+
		"Ne'er turns the key to the poor.\n"+
		"But, for all this, thou shalt have as many dolours\n"+
		"for thy daughters as thou canst tell in a year.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!\n"+
		"Hysterica passio, down, thou climbing sorrow,\n"+
		"Thy element's below! Where is this daughter?\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"With the earl, sir, here within.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Follow me not;\n"+
		"Stay here.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"Gentleman\n"+
		"Made you no more offence but what you speak of?\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"None.\n"+
		"How chance the king comes with so small a train?\n"+
		"Fool\n"+
		"And thou hadst been set i' the stocks for that\n"+
		"question, thou hadst well deserved it.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"Why, fool?\n"+
		"Fool\n"+
		"We'll set thee to school to an ant, to teach thee\n"+
		"there's no labouring i' the winter. All that follow\n"+
		"their noses are led by their eyes but blind men; and\n"+
		"there's not a nose among twenty but can smell him\n"+
		"that's stinking. Let go thy hold when a great wheel\n"+
		"runs down a hill, lest it break thy neck with\n"+
		"following it: but the great one that goes up the\n"+
		"hill, let him draw thee after. When a wise man\n"+
		"gives thee better counsel, give me mine again: I\n"+
		"would have none but knaves follow it, since a fool gives it.\n"+
		"That sir which serves and seeks for gain,\n"+
		"And follows but for form,\n"+
		"Will pack when it begins to rain,\n"+
		"And leave thee in the storm,\n"+
		"But I will tarry; the fool will stay,\n"+
		"And let the wise man fly:\n"+
		"The knave turns fool that runs away;\n"+
		"The fool no knave, perdy.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"Where learned you this, fool?\n"+
		"Fool\n"+
		"Not i' the stocks, fool.\n"+
		"Re-enter KING LEAR with GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Deny to speak with me? They are sick? they are weary?\n"+
		"They have travell'd all the night? Mere fetches;\n"+
		"The images of revolt and flying off.\n"+
		"Fetch me a better answer.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"My dear lord,\n"+
		"You know the fiery quality of the duke;\n"+
		"How unremoveable and fix'd he is\n"+
		"In his own course.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Vengeance! plague! death! confusion!\n"+
		"Fiery? what quality? Why, Gloucester, Gloucester,\n"+
		"I'ld speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Well, my good lord, I have inform'd them so.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Inform'd them! Dost thou understand me, man?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Ay, my good lord.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"The king would speak with Cornwall; the dear father\n"+
		"Would with his daughter speak, commands her service:\n"+
		"Are they inform'd of this? My breath and blood!\n"+
		"Fiery? the fiery duke? Tell the hot duke that--\n"+
		"No, but not yet: may be he is not well:\n"+
		"Infirmity doth still neglect all office\n"+
		"Whereto our health is bound; we are not ourselves\n"+
		"When nature, being oppress'd, commands the mind\n"+
		"To suffer with the body: I'll forbear;\n"+
		"And am fall'n out with my more headier will,\n"+
		"To take the indisposed and sickly fit\n"+
		"For the sound man. Death on my state! wherefore\n"+
		"Looking on KENT\n"+
		"Should he sit here? This act persuades me\n"+
		"That this remotion of the duke and her\n"+
		"Is practise only. Give me my servant forth.\n"+
		"Go tell the duke and 's wife I'ld speak with them,\n"+
		"Now, presently: bid them come forth and hear me,\n"+
		"Or at their chamber-door I'll beat the drum\n"+
		"Till it cry sleep to death.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"I would have all well betwixt you.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"O me, my heart, my rising heart! but, down!\n"+
		"Fool\n"+
		"Cry to it, nuncle, as the cockney did to the eels\n"+
		"when she put 'em i' the paste alive; she knapped 'em\n"+
		"o' the coxcombs with a stick, and cried 'Down,\n"+
		"wantons, down!' 'Twas her brother that, in pure\n"+
		"kindness to his horse, buttered his hay.\n"+
		"Enter CORNWALL, REGAN, GLOUCESTER, and Servants\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Good morrow to you both.\n"+
		"CORNWALL\n"+
		"Hail to your grace!\n"+
		"KENT is set at liberty\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"I am glad to see your highness.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Regan, I think you are; I know what reason\n"+
		"I have to think so: if thou shouldst not be glad,\n"+
		"I would divorce me from thy mother's tomb,\n"+
		"Sepulchring an adultress.\n"+
		"To KENT\n"+
		"O, are you free?\n"+
		"Some other time for that. Beloved Regan,\n"+
		"Thy sister's naught: O Regan, she hath tied\n"+
		"Sharp-tooth'd unkindness, like a vulture, here:\n"+
		"Points to his heart\n"+
		"I can scarce speak to thee; thou'lt not believe\n"+
		"With how depraved a quality--O Regan!\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"I pray you, sir, take patience: I have hope.\n"+
		"You less know how to value her desert\n"+
		"Than she to scant her duty.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Say, how is that?\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"I cannot think my sister in the least\n"+
		"Would fail her obligation: if, sir, perchance\n"+
		"She have restrain'd the riots of your followers,\n"+
		"'Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end,\n"+
		"As clears her from all blame.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"My curses on her!\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"O, sir, you are old.\n"+
		"Nature in you stands on the very verge\n"+
		"Of her confine: you should be ruled and led\n"+
		"By some discretion, that discerns your state\n"+
		"Better than you yourself. Therefore, I pray you,\n"+
		"That to our sister you do make return;\n"+
		"Say you have wrong'd her, sir.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Ask her forgiveness?\n"+
		"Do you but mark how this becomes the house:\n"+
		"'Dear daughter, I confess that I am old;\n"+
		"Kneeling\n"+
		"Age is unnecessary: on my knees I beg\n"+
		"That you'll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.'\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"Good sir, no more; these are unsightly tricks:\n"+
		"Return you to my sister.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"[Rising] Never, Regan:\n"+
		"She hath abated me of half my train;\n"+
		"Look'd black upon me; struck me with her tongue,\n"+
		"Most serpent-like, upon the very heart:\n"+
		"All the stored vengeances of heaven fall\n"+
		"On her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones,\n"+
		"You taking airs, with lameness!\n"+
		"CORNWALL\n"+
		"Fie, sir, fie!\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames\n"+
		"Into her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty,\n"+
		"You fen-suck'd fogs, drawn by the powerful sun,\n"+
		"To fall and blast her pride!\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"O the blest gods! so will you wish on me,\n"+
		"When the rash mood is on.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse:\n"+
		"Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give\n"+
		"Thee o'er to harshness: her eyes are fierce; but thine\n"+
		"Do comfort and not burn. 'Tis not in thee\n"+
		"To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,\n"+
		"To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,\n"+
		"And in conclusion to oppose the bolt\n"+
		"Against my coming in: thou better know'st\n"+
		"The offices of nature, bond of childhood,\n"+
		"Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude;\n"+
		"Thy half o' the kingdom hast thou not forgot,\n"+
		"Wherein I thee endow'd.\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"Good sir, to the purpose.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Who put my man i' the stocks?\n"+
		"Tucket within\n"+
		"CORNWALL\n"+
		"What trumpet's that?\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"I know't, my sister's: this approves her letter,\n"+
		"That she would soon be here.\n"+
		"Enter OSWALD\n"+
		"Is your lady come?\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"This is a slave, whose easy-borrow'd pride\n"+
		"Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.\n"+
		"Out, varlet, from my sight!\n"+
		"CORNWALL\n"+
		"What means your grace?\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Who stock'd my servant? Regan, I have good hope\n"+
		"Thou didst not know on't. Who comes here? O heavens,\n"+
		"Enter GONERIL\n"+
		"If you do love old men, if your sweet sway\n"+
		"Allow obedience, if yourselves are old,\n"+
		"Make it your cause; send down, and take my part!\n"+
		"To GONERIL\n"+
		"Art not ashamed to look upon this beard?\n"+
		"O Regan, wilt thou take her by the hand?\n"+
		"GONERIL\n"+
		"Why not by the hand, sir? How have I offended?\n"+
		"All's not offence that indiscretion finds\n"+
		"And dotage terms so.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"O sides, you are too tough;\n"+
		"Will you yet hold? How came my man i' the stocks?\n"+
		"CORNWALL\n"+
		"I set him there, sir: but his own disorders\n"+
		"Deserved much less advancement.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"You! did you?\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"I pray you, father, being weak, seem so.\n"+
		"If, till the expiration of your month,\n"+
		"You will return and sojourn with my sister,\n"+
		"Dismissing half your train, come then to me:\n"+
		"I am now from home, and out of that provision\n"+
		"Which shall be needful for your entertainment.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Return to her, and fifty men dismiss'd?\n"+
		"No, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose\n"+
		"To wage against the enmity o' the air;\n"+
		"To be a comrade with the wolf and owl,--\n"+
		"Necessity's sharp pinch! Return with her?\n"+
		"Why, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took\n"+
		"Our youngest born, I could as well be brought\n"+
		"To knee his throne, and, squire-like; pension beg\n"+
		"To keep base life afoot. Return with her?\n"+
		"Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter\n"+
		"To this detested groom.\n"+
		"Pointing at OSWALD\n"+
		"GONERIL\n"+
		"At your choice, sir.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad:\n"+
		"I will not trouble thee, my child; farewell:\n"+
		"We'll no more meet, no more see one another:\n"+
		"But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter;\n"+
		"Or rather a disease that's in my flesh,\n"+
		"Which I must needs call mine: thou art a boil,\n"+
		"A plague-sore, an embossed carbuncle,\n"+
		"In my corrupted blood. But I'll not chide thee;\n"+
		"Let shame come when it will, I do not call it:\n"+
		"I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot,\n"+
		"Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove:\n"+
		"Mend when thou canst; be better at thy leisure:\n"+
		"I can be patient; I can stay with Regan,\n"+
		"I and my hundred knights.\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"Not altogether so:\n"+
		"I look'd not for you yet, nor am provided\n"+
		"For your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister;\n"+
		"For those that mingle reason with your passion\n"+
		"Must be content to think you old, and so--\n"+
		"But she knows what she does.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Is this well spoken?\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"I dare avouch it, sir: what, fifty followers?\n"+
		"Is it not well? What should you need of more?\n"+
		"Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger\n"+
		"Speak 'gainst so great a number? How, in one house,\n"+
		"Should many people, under two commands,\n"+
		"Hold amity? 'Tis hard; almost impossible.\n"+
		"GONERIL\n"+
		"Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance\n"+
		"From those that she calls servants or from mine?\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"Why not, my lord? If then they chanced to slack you,\n"+
		"We could control them. If you will come to me,--\n"+
		"For now I spy a danger,--I entreat you\n"+
		"To bring but five and twenty: to no more\n"+
		"Will I give place or notice.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"I gave you all--\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"And in good time you gave it.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Made you my guardians, my depositaries;\n"+
		"But kept a reservation to be follow'd\n"+
		"With such a number. What, must I come to you\n"+
		"With five and twenty, Regan? said you so?\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"And speak't again, my lord; no more with me.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour'd,\n"+
		"When others are more wicked: not being the worst\n"+
		"Stands in some rank of praise.\n"+
		"To GONERIL\n"+
		"I'll go with thee:\n"+
		"Thy fifty yet doth double five and twenty,\n"+
		"And thou art twice her love.\n"+
		"GONERIL\n"+
		"Hear me, my lord;\n"+
		"What need you five and twenty, ten, or five,\n"+
		"To follow in a house where twice so many\n"+
		"Have a command to tend you?\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"What need one?\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"O, reason not the need: our basest beggars\n"+
		"Are in the poorest thing superfluous:\n"+
		"Allow not nature more than nature needs,\n"+
		"Man's life's as cheap as beast's: thou art a lady;\n"+
		"If only to go warm were gorgeous,\n"+
		"Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st,\n"+
		"Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need,--\n"+
		"You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!\n"+
		"You see me here, you gods, a poor old man,\n"+
		"As full of grief as age; wretched in both!\n"+
		"If it be you that stir these daughters' hearts\n"+
		"Against their father, fool me not so much\n"+
		"To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,\n"+
		"And let not women's weapons, water-drops,\n"+
		"Stain my man's cheeks! No, you unnatural hags,\n"+
		"I will have such revenges on you both,\n"+
		"That all the world shall--I will do such things,--\n"+
		"What they are, yet I know not: but they shall be\n"+
		"The terrors of the earth. You think I'll weep\n"+
		"No, I'll not weep:\n"+
		"I have full cause of weeping; but this heart\n"+
		"Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws,\n"+
		"Or ere I'll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!\n"+
		"Exeunt KING LEAR, GLOUCESTER, KENT, and Fool\n"+
		"Storm and tempest\n"+
		"CORNWALL\n"+
		"Let us withdraw; 'twill be a storm.\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"This house is little: the old man and his people\n"+
		"Cannot be well bestow'd.\n"+
		"GONERIL\n"+
		"'Tis his own blame; hath put himself from rest,\n"+
		"And must needs taste his folly.\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"For his particular, I'll receive him gladly,\n"+
		"But not one follower.\n"+
		"GONERIL\n"+
		"So am I purposed.\n"+
		"Where is my lord of Gloucester?\n"+
		"CORNWALL\n"+
		"Follow'd the old man forth: he is return'd.\n"+
		"Re-enter GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"The king is in high rage.\n"+
		"CORNWALL\n"+
		"Whither is he going?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"He calls to horse; but will I know not whither.\n"+

		"'Tis best to give him way; he leads himself.\n"+
		"GONERIL\n"+
		"My lord, entreat him by no means to stay.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Alack, the night comes on, and the bleak winds\n"+
		"Do sorely ruffle; for many miles a bout\n"+
		"There's scarce a bush.\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"O, sir, to wilful men,\n"+
		"The injuries that they themselves procure\n"+
		"Must be their schoolmasters. Shut up your doors:\n"+
		"He is attended with a desperate train;\n"+
		"And what they may incense him to, being apt\n"+
		"To have his ear abused, wisdom bids fear.\n"+
		"CORNWALL\n"+
		"Shut up your doors, my lord; 'tis a wild night:\n"+
		"My Regan counsels well; come out o' the storm.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT III\n"+
		"SCENE I. A heath.\n"+
		"Storm still. Enter KENT and a Gentleman, meeting\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"Who's there, besides foul weather?\n"+
		"Gentleman\n"+
		"One minded like the weather, most unquietly.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"I know you. Where's the king?\n"+
		"Gentleman\n"+
		"Contending with the fretful element:\n"+
		"Bids the winds blow the earth into the sea,\n"+
		"Or swell the curled water 'bove the main,\n"+
		"That things might change or cease; tears his white hair,\n"+
		"Which the impetuous blasts, with eyeless rage,\n"+
		"Catch in their fury, and make nothing of;\n"+
		"Strives in his little world of man to out-scorn\n"+
		"The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain.\n"+
		"This night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch,\n"+
		"The lion and the belly-pinched wolf\n"+
		"Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs,\n"+
		"And bids what will take all.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"But who is with him?\n"+
		"Gentleman\n"+
		"None but the fool; who labours to out-jest\n"+
		"His heart-struck injuries.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"Sir, I do know you;\n"+
		"And dare, upon the warrant of my note,\n"+
		"Commend a dear thing to you. There is division,\n"+
		"Although as yet the face of it be cover'd\n"+
		"With mutual cunning, 'twixt Albany and Cornwall;\n"+
		"Who have--as who have not, that their great stars\n"+

		"SCENE III. Gloucester's castle.\n"+
		"Enter GLOUCESTER and EDMUND\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Alack, alack, Edmund, I like not this unnatural\n"+
		"dealing. When I desire their leave that I might\n"+
		"pity him, they took from me the use of mine own\n"+

		"displeasure, neither to speak of him, entreat for\n"+
		"him, nor any way sustain him.\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"Most savage and unnatural!\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Go to; say you nothing. There's a division betwixt\n"+
		"the dukes; and a worse matter than that: I have\n"+
		"received a letter this night; 'tis dangerous to be\n"+
		"spoken; I have locked the letter in my closet:\n"+
		"these injuries the king now bears will be revenged\n"+
		"home; there's part of a power already footed: we\n"+
		"must incline to the king. I will seek him, and\n"+
		"privily relieve him: go you and maintain talk with\n"+
		"the duke, that my charity be not of him perceived:\n"+
		"if he ask for me. I am ill, and gone to bed.\n"+
		"Though I die for it, as no less is threatened me,\n"+
		"the king my old master must be relieved. There is\n"+
		"some strange thing toward, Edmund; pray you, be careful.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"This courtesy, forbid thee, shall the duke\n"+
		"Instantly know; and of that letter too:\n"+

		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Thou think'st 'tis much that this contentious storm\n"+
		"Invades us to the skin: so 'tis to thee;\n"+
		"But where the greater malady is fix'd,\n"+
		"The lesser is scarce felt. Thou'ldst shun a bear;\n"+
		"But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea,\n"+
		"Thou'ldst meet the bear i' the mouth. When the\n"+
		"mind's free,\n"+
		"The body's delicate: the tempest in my mind\n"+
		"Doth from my senses take all feeling else\n"+
		"Save what beats there. Filial ingratitude!\n"+

		"For lifting food to't? But I will punish home:\n"+
		"No, I will weep no more. In such a night\n"+
		"To shut me out! Pour on; I will endure.\n"+
		"In such a night as this! O Regan, Goneril!\n"+

		"Who gives any thing to poor Tom? whom the foul\n"+
		"fiend hath led through fire and through flame, and\n"+
		"through ford and whirlipool e'er bog and quagmire;\n"+
		"that hath laid knives under his pillow, and halters\n"+
		"in his pew; set ratsbane by his porridge; made film\n"+
		"proud of heart, to ride on a bay trotting-horse over\n"+
		"four-inched bridges, to course his own shadow for a\n"+
		"traitor. Bless thy five wits! Tom's a-cold,--O, do\n"+
		"de, do de, do de. Bless thee from whirlwinds,\n"+
		"star-blasting, and taking! Do poor Tom some\n"+
		"charity, whom the foul fiend vexes: there could I\n"+

		"Storm still\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"What, have his daughters brought him to this pass?\n"+
		"Couldst thou save nothing? Didst thou give them all?\n"+
		"Fool\n"+
		"Nay, he reserved a blanket, else we had been all shamed.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Now, all the plagues that in the pendulous air\n"+

		"He hath no daughters, sir.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Death, traitor! nothing could have subdued nature\n"+
		"To such a lowness but his unkind daughters.\n"+
		"Is it the fashion, that discarded fathers\n"+

		"Take heed o' the foul fiend: obey thy parents;\n"+

		"array. Tom's a-cold.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"What hast thou been?\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"A serving-man, proud in heart and mind; that curled\n"+
		"my hair; wore gloves in my cap; served the lust of\n"+
		"my mistress' heart, and did the act of darkness with\n"+
		"her; swore as many oaths as I spake words, and\n"+
		"broke them in the sweet face of heaven: one that\n"+
		"slept in the contriving of lust, and waked to do it:\n"+
		"wine loved I deeply, dice dearly: and in woman\n"+
		"out-paramoured the Turk: false of heart, light of\n"+

		"wolf in greediness, dog in madness, lion in prey.\n"+
		"Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of\n"+
		"silks betray thy poor heart to woman: keep thy foot\n"+
		"out of brothels, thy hand out of plackets, thy pen\n"+
		"from lenders' books, and defy the foul fiend.\n"+
		"Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind:\n"+
		"Says suum, mun, ha, no, nonny.\n"+

		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Why, thou wert better in thy grave than to answer\n"+
		"with thy uncovered body this extremity of the skies.\n"+
		"Is man no more than this? Consider him well. Thou\n"+
		"owest the worm no silk, the beast no hide, the sheep\n"+
		"no wool, the cat no perfume. Ha! here's three on\n"+
		"'s are sophisticated! Thou art the thing itself:\n"+

		"Enter GLOUCESTER, with a torch\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet: he begins\n"+
		"at curfew, and walks till the first cock; he gives\n"+

		"poor creature of earth.\n"+
		"S. Withold footed thrice the old;\n"+
		"He met the night-mare, and her nine-fold;\n"+

		"the fury of his heart, when the foul fiend rages,\n"+
		"eats cow-dung for sallets; swallows the old rat and\n"+
		"the ditch-dog; drinks the green mantle of the\n"+
		"standing pool; who is whipped from tithing to\n"+
		"tithing, and stock- punished, and imprisoned; who\n"+
		"hath had three suits to his back, six shirts to his\n"+
		"body, horse to ride, and weapon to wear;\n"+

		"Old Man\n"+
		"O, my good lord, I have been your tenant, and\n"+

		"Away, get thee away; good friend, be gone:\n"+
		"Thy comforts can do me no good at all;\n"+

		"Is it a beggar-man?\n"+
		"Old Man\n"+
		"Madman and beggar too.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"He has some reason, else he could not beg.\n"+
		"I' the last night's storm I such a fellow saw;\n"+
		"Which made me think a man a worm: my son\n"+

		"Was then scarce friends with him: I have heard\n"+
		"more since.\n"+
		"As flies to wanton boys, are we to the gods.\n"+

		"Old Man\n"+
		"Ay, my lord.\n"+

		"Then, prithee, get thee gone: if, for my sake,\n"+
		"Thou wilt o'ertake us, hence a mile or twain,\n"+
		"I' the way toward Dover, do it for ancient love;\n"+

		"EDGAR\n"+
		"Both stile and gate, horse-way and foot-path. Poor\n"+
		"Tom hath been scared out of his good wits: bless\n"+
		"thee, good man's son, from the foul fiend! five\n"+
		"fiends have been in poor Tom at once; of lust, as\n"+

		"Now, where's your master'?\n"+
		"OSWALD\n"+
		"Madam, within; but never man so changed.\n"+
		"I told him of the army that was landed;\n"+
		"He smiled at it: I told him you were coming:\n"+
		"His answer was 'The worse:' of Gloucester's treachery,\n"+
		"And of the loyal service of his son,\n"+
		"When I inform'd him, then he call'd me sot,\n"+

		"What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him;\n"+
		"What like, offensive.\n"+
		"GONERIL\n"+
		"[To EDMUND] Then shall you go no further.\n"+
		"It is the cowish terror of his spirit,\n"+
		"That dares not undertake: he'll not feel wrongs\n"+
		"Which tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way\n"+
		"May prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother;\n"+
		"Hasten his musters and conduct his powers:\n"+
		"I must change arms at home, and give the distaff\n"+
		"Into my husband's hands. This trusty servant\n"+
		"Shall pass between us: ere long you are like to hear,\n"+
		"If you dare venture in your own behalf,\n"+
		"A mistress's command. Wear this; spare speech;\n"+
		"Giving a favour\n"+
		"Decline your head: this kiss, if it durst speak,\n"+
		"Would stretch thy spirits up into the air:\n"+

		"Enter ALBANY\n"+
		"GONERIL\n"+
		"I have been worth the whistle.\n"+
		"ALBANY\n"+
		"O Goneril!\n"+
		"You are not worth the dust which the rude wind\n"+
		"Blows in your face. I fear your disposition:\n"+
		"That nature, which contemns its origin,\n"+
		"Cannot be border'd certain in itself;\n"+
		"She that herself will sliver and disbranch\n"+
		"From her material sap, perforce must wither\n"+

		"No more; the text is foolish.\n"+
		"ALBANY\n"+
		"Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile:\n"+

		"Tigers, not daughters, what have you perform'd?\n"+
		"A father, and a gracious aged man,\n"+
		"Whose reverence even the head-lugg'd bear would lick,\n"+
		"Most barbarous, most degenerate! have you madded.\n"+
		"Could my good brother suffer you to do it?\n"+
		"A man, a prince, by him so benefited!\n"+
		"If that the heavens do not their visible spirits\n"+
		"Send quickly down to tame these vile offences,\n"+
		"It will come,\n"+
		"Humanity must perforce prey on itself,\n"+
		"Like monsters of the deep.\n"+
		"GONERIL\n"+
		"Milk-liver'd man!\n"+
		"That bear'st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs;\n"+
		"Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning\n"+
		"Thine honour from thy suffering; that not know'st\n"+
		"Fools do those villains pity who are punish'd\n"+
		"Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?\n"+
		"France spreads his banners in our noiseless land;\n"+
		"With plumed helm thy slayer begins threats;\n"+
		"Whiles thou, a moral fool, sit'st still, and criest\n"+
		"'Alack, why does he so?'\n"+
		"ALBANY\n"+
		"See thyself, devil!\n"+
		"Proper deformity seems not in the fiend\n"+
		"So horrid as in woman.\n"+
		"GONERIL\n"+
		"O vain fool!\n"+
		"ALBANY\n"+
		"Thou changed and self-cover'd thing, for shame,\n"+
		"Be-monster not thy feature. Were't my fitness\n"+
		"To let these hands obey my blood,\n"+

		"What news?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"O, my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall's dead:\n"+
		"Slain by his servant, going to put out\n"+
		"The other eye of Gloucester.\n"+
		"ALBANY\n"+
		"Gloucester's eye!\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"A servant that he bred, thrill'd with remorse,\n"+
		"Opposed against the act, bending his sword\n"+
		"To his great master; who, thereat enraged,\n"+
		"Flew on him, and amongst them fell'd him dead;\n"+
		"But not without that harmful stroke, which since\n"+
		"Hath pluck'd him after.\n"+
		"ALBANY\n"+
		"This shows you are above,\n"+
		"You justicers, that these our nether crimes\n"+
		"So speedily can venge! But, O poor Gloucester!\n"+
		"Lost he his other eye?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Both, both, my lord.\n"+
		"This letter, madam, craves a speedy answer;\n"+
		"'Tis from your sister.\n"+
		"GONERIL\n"+
		"[Aside] One way I like this well;\n"+
		"But being widow, and my Gloucester with her,\n"+
		"May all the building in my fancy pluck\n"+
		"Upon my hateful life: another way,\n"+
		"The news is not so tart.--I'll read, and answer.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"ALBANY\n"+
		"Where was his son when they did take his eyes?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Come with my lady hither.\n"+
		"ALBANY\n"+
		"He is not here.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"No, my good lord; I met him back again.\n"+
		"ALBANY\n"+
		"Knows he the wickedness?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Ay, my good lord; 'twas he inform'd against him;\n"+
		"And quit the house on purpose, that their punishment\n"+
		"Might have the freer course.\n"+
		"ALBANY\n"+
		"Gloucester, I live\n"+
		"To thank thee for the love thou show'dst the king,\n"+

		"know you the reason?\n"+
		"Gentleman\n"+

		"Gentleman\n"+
		"The Marshal of France, Monsieur La Far.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"Did your letters pierce the queen to any\n"+
		"demonstration of grief?\n"+
		"Gentleman\n"+
		"Ay, sir; she took them, read them in my presence;\n"+
		"And now and then an ample tear trill'd down\n"+
		"Her delicate cheek: it seem'd she was a queen\n"+
		"Over her passion; who, most rebel-like,\n"+
		"Sought to be king o'er her.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"O, then it moved her.\n"+
		"Gentleman\n"+
		"Not to a rage: patience and sorrow strove\n"+
		"Who should express her goodliest. You have seen\n"+
		"Sunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears\n"+
		"Were like a better way: those happy smilets,\n"+
		"That play'd on her ripe lip, seem'd not to know\n"+
		"What guests were in her eyes; which parted thence,\n"+
		"As pearls from diamonds dropp'd. In brief,\n"+
		"Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved,\n"+
		"If all could so become it.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"Made she no verbal question?\n"+
		"Gentleman\n"+
		"'Faith, once or twice she heaved the name of 'father'\n"+
		"Pantingly forth, as if it press'd her heart:\n"+
		"Cried 'Sisters! sisters! Shame of ladies! sisters!\n"+
		"Kent! father! sisters! What, i' the storm? i' the night?\n"+
		"Let pity not be believed!' There she shook\n"+
		"The holy water from her heavenly eyes,\n"+
		"And clamour moisten'd: then away she started\n"+
		"To deal with grief alone.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"It is the stars,\n"+
		"The stars above us, govern our conditions;\n"+
		"Else one self mate and mate could not beget\n"+
		"Such different issues. You spoke not with her since?\n"+
		"Gentleman\n"+
		"No.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"Was this before the king return'd?\n"+
		"Gentleman\n"+
		"No, since.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear's i' the town;\n"+
		"Who sometime, in his better tune, remembers\n"+
		"What we are come about, and by no means\n"+
		"Will yield to see his daughter.\n"+
		"Gentleman\n"+
		"Why, good sir?\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"A sovereign shame so elbows him: his own unkindness,\n"+
		"That stripp'd her from his benediction, turn'd her\n"+
		"To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights\n"+
		"To his dog-hearted daughters, these things sting\n"+
		"His mind so venomously, that burning shame\n"+
		"Detains him from Cordelia.\n"+
		"Gentleman\n"+
		"Alack, poor gentleman!\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"Of Albany's and Cornwall's powers you heard not?\n"+
		"Gentleman\n"+
		"'Tis so, they are afoot.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"Well, sir, I'll bring you to our master Lear,\n"+
		"And leave you to attend him: some dear cause\n"+
		"Will in concealment wrap me up awhile;\n"+
		"When I am known aright, you shall not grieve\n"+
		"Lending me this acquaintance. I pray you, go\n"+
		"Along with me.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV. The same. A tent.\n"+
		"Enter, with drum and colours, CORDELIA, Doctor, and Soldiers\n"+
		"CORDELIA\n"+
		"Alack, 'tis he: why, he was met even now\n"+
		"As mad as the vex'd sea; singing aloud;\n"+
		"Crown'd with rank fumiter and furrow-weeds,\n"+
		"With bur-docks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo-flowers,\n"+
		"Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow\n"+
		"In our sustaining corn. A century send forth;\n"+
		"Search every acre in the high-grown field,\n"+
		"And bring him to our eye.\n"+
		"Exit an Officer\n"+
		"What can man's wisdom\n"+
		"In the restoring his bereaved sense?\n"+
		"He that helps him take all my outward worth.\n"+
		"Doctor\n"+
		"There is means, madam:\n"+
		"Our foster-nurse of nature is repose,\n"+
		"The which he lacks; that to provoke in him,\n"+
		"Are many simples operative, whose power\n"+
		"Will close the eye of anguish.\n"+
		"CORDELIA\n"+
		"All blest secrets,\n"+
		"All you unpublish'd virtues of the earth,\n"+
		"Spring with my tears! be aidant and remediate\n"+
		"In the good man's distress! Seek, seek for him;\n"+
		"Lest his ungovern'd rage dissolve the life\n"+
		"That wants the means to lead it.\n"+
		"Enter a Messenger\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"News, madam;\n"+
		"The British powers are marching hitherward.\n"+
		"CORDELIA\n"+
		"'Tis known before; our preparation stands\n"+
		"In expectation of them. O dear father,\n"+
		"It is thy business that I go about;\n"+
		"Therefore great France\n"+
		"My mourning and important tears hath pitied.\n"+
		"No blown ambition doth our arms incite,\n"+
		"But love, dear love, and our aged father's right:\n"+
		"Soon may I hear and see him!\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE V. Gloucester's castle.\n"+
		"Enter REGAN and OSWALD\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"But are my brother's powers set forth?\n"+
		"OSWALD\n"+
		"Ay, madam.\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"Himself in person there?\n"+
		"OSWALD\n"+
		"Madam, with much ado:\n"+
		"Your sister is the better soldier.\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?\n"+
		"OSWALD\n"+
		"No, madam.\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"What might import my sister's letter to him?\n"+
		"OSWALD\n"+
		"I know not, lady.\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"'Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.\n"+
		"It was great ignorance, Gloucester's eyes being out,\n"+
		"To let him live: where he arrives he moves\n"+
		"All hearts against us: Edmund, I think, is gone,\n"+
		"In pity of his misery, to dispatch\n"+
		"His nighted life: moreover, to descry\n"+
		"The strength o' the enemy.\n"+
		"OSWALD\n"+
		"I must needs after him, madam, with my letter.\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"Our troops set forth to-morrow: stay with us;\n"+
		"The ways are dangerous.\n"+
		"OSWALD\n"+
		"I may not, madam:\n"+
		"My lady charged my duty in this business.\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you\n"+
		"Transport her purposes by word? Belike,\n"+
		"Something--I know not what: I'll love thee much,\n"+
		"Let me unseal the letter.\n"+
		"OSWALD\n"+
		"Madam, I had rather--\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"I know your lady does not love her husband;\n"+
		"I am sure of that: and at her late being here\n"+
		"She gave strange oeillades and most speaking looks\n"+
		"To noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.\n"+
		"OSWALD\n"+
		"I, madam?\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"I speak in understanding; you are; I know't:\n"+
		"Therefore I do advise you, take this note:\n"+
		"My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talk'd;\n"+
		"And more convenient is he for my hand\n"+
		"Than for your lady's: you may gather more.\n"+
		"If you do find him, pray you, give him this;\n"+
		"And when your mistress hears thus much from you,\n"+
		"I pray, desire her call her wisdom to her.\n"+
		"So, fare you well.\n"+
		"If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,\n"+
		"Preferment falls on him that cuts him off.\n"+
		"OSWALD\n"+
		"Would I could meet him, madam! I should show\n"+
		"What party I do follow.\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"Fare thee well.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE VI. Fields near Dover.\n"+
		"Enter GLOUCESTER, and EDGAR dressed like a peasant\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"When shall we come to the top of that same hill?\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"You do climb up it now: look, how we labour.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Methinks the ground is even.\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"Horrible steep.\n"+
		"Hark, do you hear the sea?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"No, truly.\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"Why, then, your other senses grow imperfect\n"+
		"By your eyes' anguish.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"So may it be, indeed:\n"+
		"Methinks thy voice is alter'd; and thou speak'st\n"+
		"In better phrase and matter than thou didst.\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"You're much deceived: in nothing am I changed\n"+
		"But in my garments.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Methinks you're better spoken.\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"Come on, sir; here's the place: stand still. How fearful\n"+
		"And dizzy 'tis, to cast one's eyes so low!\n"+
		"The crows and choughs that wing the midway air\n"+
		"Show scarce so gross as beetles: half way down\n"+
		"Hangs one that gathers samphire, dreadful trade!\n"+
		"Methinks he seems no bigger than his head:\n"+
		"The fishermen, that walk upon the beach,\n"+
		"Appear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark,\n"+
		"Diminish'd to her cock; her cock, a buoy\n"+
		"Almost too small for sight: the murmuring surge,\n"+
		"That on the unnumber'd idle pebbles chafes,\n"+
		"Cannot be heard so high. I'll look no more;\n"+
		"Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight\n"+
		"Topple down headlong.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Set me where you stand.\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"Give me your hand: you are now within a foot\n"+
		"Of the extreme verge: for all beneath the moon\n"+
		"Would I not leap upright.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Let go my hand.\n"+
		"Here, friend, 's another purse; in it a jewel\n"+
		"Well worth a poor man's taking: fairies and gods\n"+
		"Prosper it with thee! Go thou farther off;\n"+
		"Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going.\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"Now fare you well, good sir.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"With all my heart.\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"Why I do trifle thus with his despair\n"+
		"Is done to cure it.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"[Kneeling] O you mighty gods!\n"+
		"This world I do renounce, and, in your sights,\n"+
		"Shake patiently my great affliction off:\n"+
		"If I could bear it longer, and not fall\n"+
		"To quarrel with your great opposeless wills,\n"+
		"My snuff and loathed part of nature should\n"+
		"Burn itself out. If Edgar live, O, bless him!\n"+
		"Now, fellow, fare thee well.\n"+
		"He falls forward\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"Gone, sir: farewell.\n"+
		"And yet I know not how conceit may rob\n"+
		"The treasury of life, when life itself\n"+
		"Yields to the theft: had he been where he thought,\n"+
		"By this, had thought been past. Alive or dead?\n"+
		"Ho, you sir! friend! Hear you, sir! speak!\n"+
		"Thus might he pass indeed: yet he revives.\n"+
		"What are you, sir?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Away, and let me die.\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,\n"+
		"So many fathom down precipitating,\n"+
		"Thou'dst shiver'd like an egg: but thou dost breathe;\n"+
		"Hast heavy substance; bleed'st not; speak'st; art sound.\n"+
		"Ten masts at each make not the altitude\n"+
		"Which thou hast perpendicularly fell:\n"+
		"Thy life's a miracle. Speak yet again.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"But have I fall'n, or no?\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.\n"+
		"Look up a-height; the shrill-gorged lark so far\n"+
		"Cannot be seen or heard: do but look up.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Alack, I have no eyes.\n"+
		"Is wretchedness deprived that benefit,\n"+
		"To end itself by death? 'Twas yet some comfort,\n"+
		"When misery could beguile the tyrant's rage,\n"+
		"And frustrate his proud will.\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"Give me your arm:\n"+
		"Up: so. How is 't? Feel you your legs? You stand.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Too well, too well.\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"This is above all strangeness.\n"+
		"Upon the crown o' the cliff, what thing was that\n"+
		"Which parted from you?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"A poor unfortunate beggar.\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"As I stood here below, methought his eyes\n"+
		"Were two full moons; he had a thousand noses,\n"+
		"Horns whelk'd and waved like the enridged sea:\n"+
		"It was some fiend; therefore, thou happy father,\n"+
		"Think that the clearest gods, who make them honours\n"+
		"Of men's impossibilities, have preserved thee.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"I do remember now: henceforth I'll bear\n"+
		"Affliction till it do cry out itself\n"+
		"'Enough, enough,' and die. That thing you speak of,\n"+
		"I took it for a man; often 'twould say\n"+
		"'The fiend, the fiend:' he led me to that place.\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"Bear free and patient thoughts. But who comes here?\n"+
		"Enter KING LEAR, fantastically dressed with wild flowers\n"+
		"The safer sense will ne'er accommodate\n"+
		"His master thus.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"No, they cannot touch me for coining; I am the\n"+
		"king himself.\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"O thou side-piercing sight!\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Nature's above art in that respect. There's your\n"+
		"press-money. That fellow handles his bow like a\n"+
		"crow-keeper: draw me a clothier's yard. Look,\n"+
		"look, a mouse! Peace, peace; this piece of toasted\n"+
		"cheese will do 't. There's my gauntlet; I'll prove\n"+
		"it on a giant. Bring up the brown bills. O, well\n"+
		"flown, bird! i' the clout, i' the clout: hewgh!\n"+
		"Give the word.\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"Sweet marjoram.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Pass.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"I know that voice.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Ha! Goneril, with a white beard! They flattered\n"+
		"me like a dog; and told me I had white hairs in my\n"+
		"beard ere the black ones were there. To say 'ay'\n"+
		"and 'no' to every thing that I said!--'Ay' and 'no'\n"+
		"too was no good divinity. When the rain came to\n"+
		"wet me once, and the wind to make me chatter; when\n"+
		"the thunder would not peace at my bidding; there I\n"+
		"found 'em, there I smelt 'em out. Go to, they are\n"+
		"not men o' their words: they told me I was every\n"+
		"thing; 'tis a lie, I am not ague-proof.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"The trick of that voice I do well remember:\n"+
		"Is 't not the king?\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Ay, every inch a king:\n"+
		"When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.\n"+
		"I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause? Adultery?\n"+
		"Thou shalt not die: die for adultery! No:\n"+
		"The wren goes to 't, and the small gilded fly\n"+
		"Does lecher in my sight.\n"+
		"Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester's bastard son\n"+
		"Was kinder to his father than my daughters\n"+
		"Got 'tween the lawful sheets.\n"+
		"To 't, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.\n"+
		"Behold yond simpering dame,\n"+
		"Whose face between her forks presages snow;\n"+
		"That minces virtue, and does shake the head\n"+
		"To hear of pleasure's name;\n"+
		"The fitchew, nor the soiled horse, goes to 't\n"+
		"With a more riotous appetite.\n"+
		"Down from the waist they are Centaurs,\n"+
		"Though women all above:\n"+
		"But to the girdle do the gods inherit,\n"+
		"Beneath is all the fiends';\n"+
		"There's hell, there's darkness, there's the\n"+
		"sulphurous pit,\n"+
		"Burning, scalding, stench, consumption; fie,\n"+
		"fie, fie! pah, pah! Give me an ounce of civet,\n"+
		"good apothecary, to sweeten my imagination:\n"+
		"there's money for thee.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"O, let me kiss that hand!\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"O ruin'd piece of nature! This great world\n"+
		"Shall so wear out to nought. Dost thou know me?\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squiny\n"+
		"at me? No, do thy worst, blind Cupid! I'll not\n"+
		"love. Read thou this challenge; mark but the\n"+
		"penning of it.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Were all the letters suns, I could not see one.\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"I would not take this from report; it is,\n"+
		"And my heart breaks at it.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Read.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"What, with the case of eyes?\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"O, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your\n"+
		"head, nor no money in your purse? Your eyes are in\n"+
		"a heavy case, your purse in a light; yet you see how\n"+
		"this world goes.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"I see it feelingly.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"What, art mad? A man may see how this world goes\n"+
		"with no eyes. Look with thine ears: see how yond\n"+
		"justice rails upon yond simple thief. Hark, in\n"+
		"thine ear: change places; and, handy-dandy, which\n"+
		"is the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen\n"+
		"a farmer's dog bark at a beggar?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Ay, sir.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"And the creature run from the cur? There thou\n"+
		"mightst behold the great image of authority: a\n"+
		"dog's obeyed in office.\n"+
		"Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!\n"+
		"Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back;\n"+
		"Thou hotly lust'st to use her in that kind\n"+
		"For which thou whipp'st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.\n"+
		"Through tatter'd clothes small vices do appear;\n"+
		"Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,\n"+
		"And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks:\n"+
		"Arm it in rags, a pigmy's straw does pierce it.\n"+
		"None does offend, none, I say, none; I'll able 'em:\n"+
		"Take that of me, my friend, who have the power\n"+
		"To seal the accuser's lips. Get thee glass eyes;\n"+
		"And like a scurvy politician, seem\n"+
		"To see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now:\n"+
		"Pull off my boots: harder, harder: so.\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"O, matter and impertinency mix'd! Reason in madness!\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.\n"+
		"I know thee well enough; thy name is Gloucester:\n"+
		"Thou must be patient; we came crying hither:\n"+
		"Thou know'st, the first time that we smell the air,\n"+
		"We wawl and cry. I will preach to thee: mark.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Alack, alack the day!\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"When we are born, we cry that we are come\n"+
		"To this great stage of fools: this a good block;\n"+
		"It were a delicate stratagem, to shoe\n"+
		"A troop of horse with felt: I'll put 't in proof;\n"+
		"And when I have stol'n upon these sons-in-law,\n"+
		"Then, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!\n"+
		"Enter a Gentleman, with Attendants\n"+
		"Gentleman\n"+
		"O, here he is: lay hand upon him. Sir,\n"+
		"Your most dear daughter--\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"No rescue? What, a prisoner? I am even\n"+
		"The natural fool of fortune. Use me well;\n"+
		"You shall have ransom. Let me have surgeons;\n"+
		"I am cut to the brains.\n"+
		"Gentleman\n"+
		"You shall have any thing.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"No seconds? all myself?\n"+
		"Why, this would make a man a man of salt,\n"+
		"To use his eyes for garden water-pots,\n"+
		"Ay, and laying autumn's dust.\n"+
		"Gentleman\n"+
		"Good sir,--\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"I will die bravely, like a bridegroom. What!\n"+
		"I will be jovial: come, come; I am a king,\n"+
		"My masters, know you that.\n"+
		"Gentleman\n"+
		"You are a royal one, and we obey you.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Then there's life in't. Nay, if you get it, you\n"+
		"shall get it with running. Sa, sa, sa, sa.\n"+
		"Exit running; Attendants follow\n"+
		"Gentleman\n"+
		"A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch,\n"+
		"Past speaking of in a king! Thou hast one daughter,\n"+
		"Who redeems nature from the general curse\n"+
		"Which twain have brought her to.\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"Hail, gentle sir.\n"+
		"Gentleman\n"+
		"Sir, speed you: what's your will?\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"Do you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward?\n"+
		"Gentleman\n"+
		"Most sure and vulgar: every one hears that,\n"+
		"Which can distinguish sound.\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"But, by your favour,\n"+
		"How near's the other army?\n"+
		"Gentleman\n"+
		"Near and on speedy foot; the main descry\n"+
		"Stands on the hourly thought.\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"I thank you, sir: that's all.\n"+
		"Gentleman\n"+
		"Though that the queen on special cause is here,\n"+
		"Her army is moved on.\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"I thank you, sir.\n"+
		"Exit Gentleman\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"You ever-gentle gods, take my breath from me:\n"+
		"Let not my worser spirit tempt me again\n"+
		"To die before you please!\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"Well pray you, father.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Now, good sir, what are you?\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"A most poor man, made tame to fortune's blows;\n"+
		"Who, by the art of known and feeling sorrows,\n"+
		"Am pregnant to good pity. Give me your hand,\n"+
		"I'll lead you to some biding.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Hearty thanks:\n"+
		"The bounty and the benison of heaven\n"+
		"To boot, and boot!\n"+
		"Enter OSWALD\n"+
		"OSWALD\n"+
		"A proclaim'd prize! Most happy!\n"+
		"That eyeless head of thine was first framed flesh\n"+
		"To raise my fortunes. Thou old unhappy traitor,\n"+
		"Briefly thyself remember: the sword is out\n"+
		"That must destroy thee.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Now let thy friendly hand\n"+
		"Put strength enough to't.\n"+
		"EDGAR interposes\n"+
		"OSWALD\n"+
		"Wherefore, bold peasant,\n"+
		"Darest thou support a publish'd traitor? Hence;\n"+
		"Lest that the infection of his fortune take\n"+
		"Like hold on thee. Let go his arm.\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"Ch'ill not let go, zir, without vurther 'casion.\n"+
		"OSWALD\n"+
		"Let go, slave, or thou diest!\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"Good gentleman, go your gait, and let poor volk\n"+
		"pass. An chud ha' bin zwaggered out of my life,\n"+
		"'twould not ha' bin zo long as 'tis by a vortnight.\n"+
		"Nay, come not near th' old man; keep out, che vor\n"+

		"Out, dunghill!\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"Ch'ill pick your teeth, zir: come; no matter vor\n"+
		"your foins.\n"+
		"They fight, and EDGAR knocks him down\n"+
		"OSWALD\n"+
		"Slave, thou hast slain me: villain, take my purse:\n"+
		"If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body;\n"+
		"And give the letters which thou find'st about me\n"+
		"To Edmund earl of Gloucester; seek him out\n"+
		"Upon the British party: O, untimely death!\n"+
		"Dies\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"I know thee well: a serviceable villain;\n"+
		"As duteous to the vices of thy mistress\n"+
		"As badness would desire.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"What, is he dead?\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+

		"Enter CORDELIA, KENT, and Doctor\n"+
		"CORDELIA\n"+
		"O thou good Kent, how shall I live and work,\n"+
		"To match thy goodness? My life will be too short,\n"+
		"And every measure fail me.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"To be acknowledged, madam, is o'erpaid.\n"+
		"All my reports go with the modest truth;\n"+
		"Nor more nor clipp'd, but so.\n"+
		"CORDELIA\n"+
		"Be better suited:\n"+
		"These weeds are memories of those worser hours:\n"+
		"I prithee, put them off.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"Pardon me, dear madam;\n"+
		"Yet to be known shortens my made intent:\n"+
		"My boon I make it, that you know me not\n"+
		"Till time and I think meet.\n"+
		"CORDELIA\n"+
		"Then be't so, my good lord.\n"+
		"To the Doctor\n"+
		"How does the king?\n"+
		"Doctor\n"+
		"Madam, sleeps still.\n"+
		"CORDELIA\n"+
		"O you kind gods,\n"+
		"Cure this great breach in his abused nature!\n"+
		"The untuned and jarring senses, O, wind up\n"+
		"Of this child-changed father!\n"+
		"Doctor\n"+
		"So please your majesty\n"+
		"That we may wake the king: he hath slept long.\n"+
		"CORDELIA\n"+
		"Be govern'd by your knowledge, and proceed\n"+
		"I' the sway of your own will. Is he array'd?\n"+
		"Gentleman\n"+
		"Ay, madam; in the heaviness of his sleep\n"+
		"We put fresh garments on him.\n"+
		"Doctor\n"+
		"Be by, good madam, when we do awake him;\n"+
		"I doubt not of his temperance.\n"+
		"CORDELIA\n"+
		"Very well.\n"+
		"Doctor\n"+
		"Please you, draw near. Louder the music there!\n"+
		"CORDELIA\n"+
		"O my dear father! Restoration hang\n"+
		"Thy medicine on my lips; and let this kiss\n"+
		"Repair those violent harms that my two sisters\n"+
		"Have in thy reverence made!\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"Kind and dear princess!\n"+
		"CORDELIA\n"+
		"Had you not been their father, these white flakes\n"+
		"Had challenged pity of them. Was this a face\n"+
		"To be opposed against the warring winds?\n"+
		"To stand against the deep dread-bolted thunder?\n"+
		"In the most terrible and nimble stroke\n"+
		"Of quick, cross lightning? to watch--poor perdu!--\n"+
		"With this thin helm? Mine enemy's dog,\n"+
		"Though he had bit me, should have stood that night\n"+
		"Against my fire; and wast thou fain, poor father,\n"+
		"To hovel thee with swine, and rogues forlorn,\n"+
		"In short and musty straw? Alack, alack!\n"+
		"'Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once\n"+
		"Had not concluded all. He wakes; speak to him.\n"+
		"Doctor\n"+
		"Madam, do you; 'tis fittest.\n"+
		"CORDELIA\n"+
		"How does my royal lord? How fares your majesty?\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"You do me wrong to take me out o' the grave:\n"+
		"Thou art a soul in bliss; but I am bound\n"+
		"Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears\n"+
		"Do scald like moulten lead.\n"+
		"CORDELIA\n"+
		"Sir, do you know me?\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"You are a spirit, I know: when did you die?\n"+
		"CORDELIA\n"+
		"Still, still, far wide!\n"+
		"Doctor\n"+
		"He's scarce awake: let him alone awhile.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Where have I been? Where am I? Fair daylight?\n"+
		"I am mightily abused. I should e'en die with pity,\n"+
		"To see another thus. I know not what to say.\n"+
		"I will not swear these are my hands: let's see;\n"+
		"I feel this pin prick. Would I were assured\n"+
		"Of my condition!\n"+
		"CORDELIA\n"+
		"O, look upon me, sir,\n"+
		"And hold your hands in benediction o'er me:\n"+
		"No, sir, you must not kneel.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Pray, do not mock me:\n"+
		"I am a very foolish fond old man,\n"+
		"Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less;\n"+
		"And, to deal plainly,\n"+
		"I fear I am not in my perfect mind.\n"+
		"Methinks I should know you, and know this man;\n"+
		"Yet I am doubtful for I am mainly ignorant\n"+
		"What place this is; and all the skill I have\n"+
		"Remembers not these garments; nor I know not\n"+
		"Where I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me;\n"+
		"For, as I am a man, I think this lady\n"+
		"To be my child Cordelia.\n"+
		"CORDELIA\n"+
		"And so I am, I am.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Be your tears wet? yes, 'faith. I pray, weep not:\n"+
		"If you have poison for me, I will drink it.\n"+
		"I know you do not love me; for your sisters\n"+
		"Have, as I do remember, done me wrong:\n"+
		"You have some cause, they have not.\n"+
		"CORDELIA\n"+
		"No cause, no cause.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Am I in France?\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"In your own kingdom, sir.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Do not abuse me.\n"+
		"Doctor\n"+
		"Be comforted, good madam: the great rage,\n"+
		"You see, is kill'd in him: and yet it is danger\n"+
		"To make him even o'er the time he has lost.\n"+
		"Desire him to go in; trouble him no more\n"+
		"Till further settling.\n"+
		"CORDELIA\n"+
		"Will't please your highness walk?\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"You must bear with me:\n"+
		"Pray you now, forget and forgive: I am old and foolish.\n"+
		"Exeunt all but KENT and Gentleman\n"+
		"Gentleman\n"+
		"Holds it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall was so slain?\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"Most certain, sir.\n"+
		"Gentleman\n"+
		"Who is conductor of his people?\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"As 'tis said, the bastard son of Gloucester.\n"+
		"Gentleman\n"+
		"They say Edgar, his banished son, is with the Earl\n"+

		"KENT\n"+
		"Report is changeable. 'Tis time to look about; the\n"+

		"well, sir.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+

		"In honour'd love.\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"But have you never found my brother's way\n"+
		"To the forfended place?\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"That thought abuses you.\n"+

		"EDMUND\n"+
		"No, by mine honour, madam.\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"I never shall endure her: dear my lord,\n"+

		"Our very loving sister, well be-met.\n"+
		"Sir, this I hear; the king is come to his daughter,\n"+
		"With others whom the rigor of our state\n"+
		"Forced to cry out. Where I could not be honest,\n"+

		"EDMUND\n"+
		"Sir, you speak nobly.\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"Why is this reason'd?\n"+
		"GONERIL\n"+
		"Combine together 'gainst the enemy;\n"+
		"For these domestic and particular broils\n"+
		"Are not the question here.\n"+
		"ALBANY\n"+
		"Let's then determine\n"+

		"Before you fight the battle, ope this letter.\n"+
		"If you have victory, let the trumpet sound\n"+
		"For him that brought it: wretched though I seem,\n"+

		"Exit\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"To both these sisters have I sworn my love;\n"+
		"Each jealous of the other, as the stung\n"+

		"Both? one? or neither? Neither can be enjoy'd,\n"+
		"If both remain alive: to take the widow\n"+
		"Exasperates, makes mad her sister Goneril;\n"+
		"And hardly shall I carry out my side,\n"+
		"Her husband being alive. Now then we'll use\n"+
		"His countenance for the battle; which being done,\n"+
		"Let her who would be rid of him devise\n"+
		"His speedy taking off. As for the mercy\n"+
		"Which he intends to Lear and to Cordelia,\n"+

		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"No, no, no, no! Come, let's away to prison:\n"+
		"We two alone will sing like birds i' the cage:\n"+
		"When thou dost ask me blessing, I'll kneel down,\n"+
		"And ask of thee forgiveness: so we'll live,\n"+
		"And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh\n"+
		"At gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues\n"+
		"Talk of court news; and we'll talk with them too,\n"+
		"Who loses and who wins; who's in, who's out;\n"+
		"And take upon's the mystery of things,\n"+
		"As if we were God's spies: and we'll wear out,\n"+
		"In a wall'd prison, packs and sects of great ones,\n"+
		"That ebb and flow by the moon.\n"+

		"Take them away.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,\n"+
		"The gods themselves throw incense. Have I caught thee?\n"+
		"He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven,\n"+
		"And fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes;\n"+
		"The good-years shall devour them, flesh and fell,\n"+
		"Ere they shall make us weep: we'll see 'em starve\n"+

		"Does not become a sword: thy great employment\n"+
		"Will not bear question; either say thou'lt do 't,\n"+
		"Or thrive by other means.\n"+
		"Captain\n"+
		"I'll do 't, my lord.\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"About it; and write happy when thou hast done.\n"+
		"Mark, I say, instantly; and carry it so\n"+
		"As I have set it down.\n"+
		"Captain\n"+
		"I cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats;\n"+
		"If it be man's work, I'll do 't.\n"+

		"Flourish. Enter ALBANY, GONERIL, REGAN, another Captain, and Soldiers\n"+
		"ALBANY\n"+
		"Sir, you have shown to-day your valiant strain,\n"+
		"And fortune led you well: you have the captives\n"+
		"That were the opposites of this day's strife:\n"+
		"We do require them of you, so to use them\n"+
		"As we shall find their merits and our safety\n"+
		"May equally determine.\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"Sir, I thought it fit\n"+
		"To send the old and miserable king\n"+
		"To some retention and appointed guard;\n"+
		"Whose age has charms in it, whose title more,\n"+
		"To pluck the common bosom on his side,\n"+
		"An turn our impress'd lances in our eyes\n"+
		"Which do command them. With him I sent the queen;\n"+
		"My reason all the same; and they are ready\n"+
		"To-morrow, or at further space, to appear\n"+
		"Where you shall hold your session. At this time\n"+
		"We sweat and bleed: the friend hath lost his friend;\n"+
		"And the best quarrels, in the heat, are cursed\n"+
		"By those that feel their sharpness:\n"+
		"The question of Cordelia and her father\n"+
		"Requires a fitter place.\n"+
		"ALBANY\n"+
		"Sir, by your patience,\n"+
		"I hold you but a subject of this war,\n"+
		"Not as a brother.\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"That's as we list to grace him.\n"+
		"Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded,\n"+
		"Ere you had spoke so far. He led our powers;\n"+
		"Bore the commission of my place and person;\n"+
		"The which immediacy may well stand up,\n"+
		"And call itself your brother.\n"+
		"GONERIL\n"+
		"Not so hot:\n"+
		"In his own grace he doth exalt himself,\n"+
		"More than in your addition.\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"In my rights,\n"+
		"By me invested, he compeers the best.\n"+

		"That eye that told you so look'd but a-squint.\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"Lady, I am not well; else I should answer\n"+
		"From a full-flowing stomach. General,\n"+
		"Take thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony;\n"+
		"Dispose of them, of me; the walls are thine:\n"+
		"Witness the world, that I create thee here\n"+
		"My lord and master.\n"+

		"Mean you to enjoy him?\n"+
		"ALBANY\n"+
		"The let-alone lies not in your good will.\n"+

		"Half-blooded fellow, yes.\n"+
		"REGAN\n"+
		"[To EDMUND] Let the drum strike, and prove my title thine.\n"+

		"On capital treason; and, in thine attaint,\n"+
		"This gilded serpent\n"+
		"Pointing to Goneril\n"+
		"For your claim, fair sister,\n"+
		"I bar it in the interest of my wife:\n"+
		"'Tis she is sub-contracted to this lord,\n"+

		"There is my pledge;\n"+
		"Throwing down a glove\n"+
		"I'll prove it on thy heart,\n"+
		"Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less\n"+

		"Sick, O, sick!\n"+
		"GONERIL\n"+
		"[Aside] If not, I'll ne'er trust medicine.\n"+

		"That names me traitor, villain-like he lies:\n"+
		"Call by thy trumpet: he that dares approach,\n"+
		"On him, on you, who not? I will maintain\n"+
		"My truth and honour firmly.\n"+
		"ALBANY\n"+
		"A herald, ho!\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"A herald, ho, a herald!\n"+
		"ALBANY\n"+
		"Trust to thy single virtue; for thy soldiers,\n"+
		"All levied in my name, have in my name\n"+
		"Took their discharge.\n"+

		"Despite thy victor sword and fire-new fortune,\n"+
		"Thy valour and thy heart, thou art a traitor;\n"+
		"False to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father;\n"+
		"Conspirant 'gainst this high-illustrious prince;\n"+
		"And, from the extremest upward of thy head\n"+

		"ALBANY\n"+
		"Save him, save him!\n"+
		"GONERIL\n"+
		"This is practise, Gloucester:\n"+
		"By the law of arms thou wast not bound to answer\n"+
		"An unknown opposite; thou art not vanquish'd,\n"+
		"But cozen'd and beguiled.\n"+
		"ALBANY\n"+
		"Shut your mouth, dame,\n"+
		"Or with this paper shall I stop it: Hold, sir:\n"+
		"Thou worse than any name, read thine own evil:\n"+
		"No tearing, lady: I perceive you know it.\n"+
		"Gives the letter to EDMUND\n"+
		"GONERIL\n"+
		"Say, if I do, the laws are mine, not thine:\n"+
		"Who can arraign me for't.\n"+
		"ALBANY\n"+
		"Most monstrous! oh!\n"+
		"Know'st thou this paper?\n"+
		"GONERIL\n"+
		"Ask me not what I know.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"ALBANY\n"+
		"Go after her: she's desperate; govern her.\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"What you have charged me with, that have I done;\n"+
		"And more, much more; the time will bring it out:\n"+
		"'Tis past, and so am I. But what art thou\n"+
		"That hast this fortune on me? If thou'rt noble,\n"+
		"I do forgive thee.\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"Let's exchange charity.\n"+
		"I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund;\n"+
		"If more, the more thou hast wrong'd me.\n"+
		"My name is Edgar, and thy father's son.\n"+
		"The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices\n"+
		"Make instruments to plague us:\n"+
		"The dark and vicious place where thee he got\n"+
		"Cost him his eyes.\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"Thou hast spoken right, 'tis true;\n"+
		"The wheel is come full circle: I am here.\n"+
		"ALBANY\n"+
		"Methought thy very gait did prophesy\n"+
		"A royal nobleness: I must embrace thee:\n"+
		"Let sorrow split my heart, if ever I\n"+
		"Did hate thee or thy father!\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"Worthy prince, I know't.\n"+
		"ALBANY\n"+
		"Where have you hid yourself?\n"+
		"How have you known the miseries of your father?\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale;\n"+
		"And when 'tis told, O, that my heart would burst!\n"+
		"The bloody proclamation to escape,\n"+
		"That follow'd me so near,--O, our lives' sweetness!\n"+
		"That we the pain of death would hourly die\n"+
		"Rather than die at once!--taught me to shift\n"+
		"Into a madman's rags; to assume a semblance\n"+
		"That very dogs disdain'd: and in this habit\n"+
		"Met I my father with his bleeding rings,\n"+
		"Their precious stones new lost: became his guide,\n"+
		"Led him, begg'd for him, saved him from despair;\n"+
		"Never,--O fault!--reveal'd myself unto him,\n"+
		"Until some half-hour past, when I was arm'd:\n"+
		"Not sure, though hoping, of this good success,\n"+
		"I ask'd his blessing, and from first to last\n"+
		"Told him my pilgrimage: but his flaw'd heart,\n"+
		"Alack, too weak the conflict to support!\n"+
		"'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,\n"+
		"Burst smilingly.\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"This speech of yours hath moved me,\n"+
		"And shall perchance do good: but speak you on;\n"+
		"You look as you had something more to say.\n"+
		"ALBANY\n"+
		"If there be more, more woeful, hold it in;\n"+
		"For I am almost ready to dissolve,\n"+
		"Hearing of this.\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"This would have seem'd a period\n"+
		"To such as love not sorrow; but another,\n"+
		"To amplify too much, would make much more,\n"+
		"And top extremity.\n"+
		"Whilst I was big in clamour came there in a man,\n"+
		"Who, having seen me in my worst estate,\n"+
		"Shunn'd my abhorr'd society; but then, finding\n"+
		"Who 'twas that so endured, with his strong arms\n"+
		"He fastened on my neck, and bellow'd out\n"+
		"As he'ld burst heaven; threw him on my father;\n"+
		"Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him\n"+
		"That ever ear received: which in recounting\n"+
		"His grief grew puissant and the strings of life\n"+
		"Began to crack: twice then the trumpets sounded,\n"+
		"And there I left him tranced.\n"+
		"ALBANY\n"+
		"But who was this?\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguise\n"+
		"Follow'd his enemy king, and did him service\n"+
		"Improper for a slave.\n"+
		"Enter a Gentleman, with a bloody knife\n"+
		"Gentleman\n"+
		"Help, help, O, help!\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"What kind of help?\n"+
		"ALBANY\n"+
		"Speak, man.\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"What means that bloody knife?\n"+
		"Gentleman\n"+
		"'Tis hot, it smokes;\n"+
		"It came even from the heart of--O, she's dead!\n"+
		"ALBANY\n"+
		"Who dead? speak, man.\n"+
		"Gentleman\n"+
		"Your lady, sir, your lady: and her sister\n"+
		"By her is poisoned; she hath confess'd it.\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"I was contracted to them both: all three\n"+
		"Now marry in an instant.\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"Here comes Kent.\n"+
		"ALBANY\n"+
		"Produce their bodies, be they alive or dead:\n"+
		"This judgment of the heavens, that makes us tremble,\n"+
		"Touches us not with pity.\n"+
		"Exit Gentleman\n"+
		"Enter KENT\n"+
		"O, is this he?\n"+
		"The time will not allow the compliment\n"+
		"Which very manners urges.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"I am come\n"+
		"To bid my king and master aye good night:\n"+
		"Is he not here?\n"+
		"ALBANY\n"+
		"Great thing of us forgot!\n"+
		"Speak, Edmund, where's the king? and where's Cordelia?\n"+
		"See'st thou this object, Kent?\n"+
		"The bodies of GONERIL and REGAN are brought in\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"Alack, why thus?\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"Yet Edmund was beloved:\n"+
		"The one the other poison'd for my sake,\n"+
		"And after slew herself.\n"+
		"ALBANY\n"+
		"Even so. Cover their faces.\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"I pant for life: some good I mean to do,\n"+
		"Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send,\n"+
		"Be brief in it, to the castle; for my writ\n"+
		"Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia:\n"+
		"Nay, send in time.\n"+
		"ALBANY\n"+
		"Run, run, O, run!\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"To who, my lord? Who hath the office? send\n"+
		"Thy token of reprieve.\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"Well thought on: take my sword,\n"+
		"Give it the captain.\n"+
		"ALBANY\n"+
		"Haste thee, for thy life.\n"+
		"Exit EDGAR\n"+
		"EDMUND\n"+
		"He hath commission from thy wife and me\n"+
		"To hang Cordelia in the prison, and\n"+
		"To lay the blame upon her own despair,\n"+
		"That she fordid herself.\n"+
		"ALBANY\n"+
		"The gods defend her! Bear him hence awhile.\n"+
		"EDMUND is borne off\n"+
		"Re-enter KING LEAR, with CORDELIA dead in his arms; EDGAR, Captain, and others following\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Howl, howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stones:\n"+
		"Had I your tongues and eyes, I'ld use them so\n"+
		"That heaven's vault should crack. She's gone for ever!\n"+
		"I know when one is dead, and when one lives;\n"+
		"She's dead as earth. Lend me a looking-glass;\n"+
		"If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,\n"+
		"Why, then she lives.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"Is this the promised end\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"Or image of that horror?\n"+
		"ALBANY\n"+
		"Fall, and cease!\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"This feather stirs; she lives! if it be so,\n"+
		"It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows\n"+
		"That ever I have felt.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"[Kneeling] O my good master!\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Prithee, away.\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"'Tis noble Kent, your friend.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!\n"+
		"I might have saved her; now she's gone for ever!\n"+
		"Cordelia, Cordelia! stay a little. Ha!\n"+
		"What is't thou say'st? Her voice was ever soft,\n"+
		"Gentle, and low, an excellent thing in woman.\n"+
		"I kill'd the slave that was a-hanging thee.\n"+
		"Captain\n"+
		"'Tis true, my lords, he did.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Did I not, fellow?\n"+
		"I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion\n"+
		"I would have made them skip: I am old now,\n"+
		"And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you?\n"+
		"Mine eyes are not o' the best: I'll tell you straight.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"If fortune brag of two she loved and hated,\n"+
		"One of them we behold.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"This is a dull sight. Are you not Kent?\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"The same,\n"+
		"Your servant Kent: Where is your servant Caius?\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"He's a good fellow, I can tell you that;\n"+
		"He'll strike, and quickly too: he's dead and rotten.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"No, my good lord; I am the very man,--\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"I'll see that straight.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"That, from your first of difference and decay,\n"+
		"Have follow'd your sad steps.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"You are welcome hither.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"Nor no man else: all's cheerless, dark, and deadly.\n"+
		"Your eldest daughters have fordone them selves,\n"+
		"And desperately are dead.\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"Ay, so I think.\n"+
		"ALBANY\n"+
		"He knows not what he says: and vain it is\n"+
		"That we present us to him.\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"Very bootless.\n"+
		"Enter a Captain\n"+
		"Captain\n"+
		"Edmund is dead, my lord.\n"+
		"ALBANY\n"+
		"That's but a trifle here.\n"+
		"You lords and noble friends, know our intent.\n"+
		"What comfort to this great decay may come\n"+
		"Shall be applied: for us we will resign,\n"+
		"During the life of this old majesty,\n"+
		"To him our absolute power:\n"+
		"To EDGAR and KENT\n"+
		"you, to your rights:\n"+
		"With boot, and such addition as your honours\n"+
		"Have more than merited. All friends shall taste\n"+
		"The wages of their virtue, and all foes\n"+
		"The cup of their deservings. O, see, see!\n"+
		"KING LEAR\n"+
		"And my poor fool is hang'd! No, no, no life!\n"+
		"Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,\n"+
		"And thou no breath at all? Thou'lt come no more,\n"+
		"Never, never, never, never, never!\n"+
		"Pray you, undo this button: thank you, sir.\n"+
		"Do you see this? Look on her, look, her lips,\n"+
		"Look there, look there!\n"+
		"Dies\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"He faints! My lord, my lord!\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"Break, heart; I prithee, break!\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"Look up, my lord.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"Vex not his ghost: O, let him pass! he hates him much\n"+
		"That would upon the rack of this tough world\n"+
		"Stretch him out longer.\n"+
		"EDGAR\n"+
		"He is gone, indeed.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"The wonder is, he hath endured so long:\n"+
		"He but usurp'd his life.\n"+
		"ALBANY\n"+
		"Bear them from hence. Our present business\n"+
		"Is general woe.\n"+
		"To KENT and EDGAR\n"+
		"Friends of my soul, you twain\n"+
		"Rule in this realm, and the gored state sustain.\n"+
		"KENT\n"+
		"I have a journey, sir, shortly to go;\n"+
		"My master calls me, I must not say no.\n"+
		"ALBANY\n"+
		"The weight of this sad time we must obey;\n"+
		"Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.\n"+
		"The oldest hath borne most: we that are young\n"+
		"Shall never see so much, nor live so long.\n"+
		"Exeunt, with a dead march\n"
