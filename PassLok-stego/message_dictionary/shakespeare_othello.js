		"Othello, the Moore of Venice\n"+
		"ACT I\n"+
		"SCENE I. Venice. A street.\n"+
		"Enter RODERIGO and IAGO\n"+
		"RODERIGO\n"+
		"Tush! never tell me; I take it much unkindly\n"+
		"That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse\n"+
		"As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"'Sblood, but you will not hear me:\n"+
		"If ever I did dream of such a matter, Abhor me.\n"+
		"RODERIGO\n"+
		"Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city,\n"+
		"In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,\n"+
		"Off-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man,\n"+
		"I know my price, I am worth no worse a place:\n"+
		"But he; as loving his own pride and purposes,\n"+
		"Evades them, with a bombast circumstance\n"+
		"Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war;\n"+
		"And, in conclusion,\n"+
		"Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he,\n"+
		"'I have already chose my officer.'\n"+
		"And what was he?\n"+
		"Forsooth, a great arithmetician,\n"+
		"One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,\n"+
		"A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;\n"+
		"That never set a squadron in the field,\n"+
		"Nor the division of a battle knows\n"+
		"More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,\n"+
		"Wherein the toged consuls can propose\n"+
		"As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,\n"+
		"Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election:\n"+
		"And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof\n"+
		"At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds\n"+
		"Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd\n"+
		"By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,\n"+
		"He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,\n"+
		"And I--God bless the mark!--his Moorship's ancient.\n"+
		"RODERIGO\n"+
		"By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Why, there's no remedy; 'tis the curse of service,\n"+
		"Preferment goes by letter and affection,\n"+
		"And not by old gradation, where each second\n"+
		"Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself,\n"+
		"Whether I in any just term am affined\n"+
		"To love the Moor.\n"+
		"RODERIGO\n"+
		"I would not follow him then.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"O, sir, content you;\n"+
		"I follow him to serve my turn upon him:\n"+
		"We cannot all be masters, nor all masters\n"+
		"Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark\n"+
		"Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,\n"+
		"That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,\n"+
		"Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,\n"+
		"For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd:\n"+
		"Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are\n"+
		"Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,\n"+
		"Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,\n"+
		"And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,\n"+
		"Do well thrive by them and when they have lined\n"+
		"their coats\n"+
		"Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;\n"+
		"And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,\n"+
		"It is as sure as you are Roderigo,\n"+
		"Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:\n"+
		"In following him, I follow but myself;\n"+
		"Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,\n"+
		"But seeming so, for my peculiar end:\n"+
		"For when my outward action doth demonstrate\n"+
		"The native act and figure of my heart\n"+
		"In compliment extern, 'tis not long after\n"+
		"But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve\n"+
		"For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.\n"+
		"RODERIGO\n"+
		"What a full fortune does the thicklips owe\n"+
		"If he can carry't thus!\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Call up her father,\n"+
		"Rouse him: make after him, poison his delight,\n"+
		"Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,\n"+
		"And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,\n"+
		"Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,\n"+
		"Yet throw such changes of vexation on't,\n"+
		"As it may lose some colour.\n"+
		"RODERIGO\n"+
		"Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell\n"+
		"As when, by night and negligence, the fire\n"+
		"Is spied in populous cities.\n"+
		"RODERIGO\n"+
		"What, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Awake! what, ho, Brabantio! thieves! thieves! thieves!\n"+
		"Look to your house, your daughter and your bags!\n"+
		"Thieves! thieves!\n"+
		"BRABANTIO appears above, at a window\n"+
		"BRABANTIO\n"+
		"What is the reason of this terrible summons?\n"+
		"What is the matter there?\n"+
		"RODERIGO\n"+
		"Signior, is all your family within?\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Are your doors lock'd?\n"+
		"BRABANTIO\n"+
		"Why, wherefore ask you this?\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"'Zounds, sir, you're robb'd; for shame, put on\n"+
		"your gown;\n"+
		"Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;\n"+
		"Even now, now, very now, an old black ram\n"+
		"Is topping your white ewe. Arise, arise;\n"+
		"Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,\n"+
		"Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you:\n"+
		"Arise, I say.\n"+
		"BRABANTIO\n"+
		"What, have you lost your wits?\n"+
		"RODERIGO\n"+
		"Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?\n"+
		"BRABANTIO\n"+
		"Not I what are you?\n"+
		"RODERIGO\n"+
		"My name is Roderigo.\n"+
		"BRABANTIO\n"+
		"The worser welcome:\n"+
		"I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors:\n"+
		"In honest plainness thou hast heard me say\n"+
		"My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness,\n"+
		"Being full of supper and distempering draughts,\n"+
		"Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come\n"+
		"To start my quiet.\n"+
		"RODERIGO\n"+
		"Sir, sir, sir,--\n"+
		"BRABANTIO\n"+
		"But thou must needs be sure\n"+
		"My spirit and my place have in them power\n"+
		"To make this bitter to thee.\n"+
		"RODERIGO\n"+
		"Patience, good sir.\n"+
		"BRABANTIO\n"+
		"What tell'st thou me of robbing? this is Venice;\n"+
		"My house is not a grange.\n"+
		"RODERIGO\n"+
		"Most grave Brabantio,\n"+
		"In simple and pure soul I come to you.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"'Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not\n"+
		"serve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come to\n"+
		"do you service and you think we are ruffians, you'll\n"+
		"have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse;\n"+
		"you'll have your nephews neigh to you; you'll have\n"+
		"coursers for cousins and gennets for germans.\n"+
		"BRABANTIO\n"+
		"What profane wretch art thou?\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter\n"+
		"and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.\n"+
		"BRABANTIO\n"+
		"Thou art a villain.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"You are--a senator.\n"+
		"BRABANTIO\n"+
		"This thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo.\n"+
		"RODERIGO\n"+
		"Sir, I will answer any thing. But, I beseech you,\n"+
		"If't be your pleasure and most wise consent,\n"+
		"As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter,\n"+
		"At this odd-even and dull watch o' the night,\n"+
		"Transported, with no worse nor better guard\n"+
		"But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,\n"+
		"To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor--\n"+
		"If this be known to you and your allowance,\n"+
		"We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;\n"+
		"But if you know not this, my manners tell me\n"+
		"We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe\n"+
		"That, from the sense of all civility,\n"+
		"I thus would play and trifle with your reverence:\n"+
		"Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,\n"+
		"I say again, hath made a gross revolt;\n"+
		"Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes\n"+
		"In an extravagant and wheeling stranger\n"+
		"Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself:\n"+
		"If she be in her chamber or your house,\n"+
		"Let loose on me the justice of the state\n"+
		"For thus deluding you.\n"+
		"BRABANTIO\n"+
		"Strike on the tinder, ho!\n"+
		"Give me a taper! call up all my people!\n"+
		"This accident is not unlike my dream:\n"+
		"Belief of it oppresses me already.\n"+
		"Light, I say! light!\n"+
		"Exit above\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Farewell; for I must leave you:\n"+
		"It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,\n"+
		"To be produced--as, if I stay, I shall--\n"+
		"Against the Moor: for, I do know, the state,\n"+
		"However this may gall him with some cheque,\n"+
		"Cannot with safety cast him, for he's embark'd\n"+
		"With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,\n"+
		"Which even now stand in act, that, for their souls,\n"+
		"Another of his fathom they have none,\n"+
		"To lead their business: in which regard,\n"+
		"Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains.\n"+
		"Yet, for necessity of present life,\n"+
		"I must show out a flag and sign of love,\n"+
		"Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,\n"+
		"Lead to the Sagittary the raised search;\n"+
		"And there will I be with him. So, farewell.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"Enter, below, BRABANTIO, and Servants with torches\n"+
		"BRABANTIO\n"+
		"It is too true an evil: gone she is;\n"+
		"And what's to come of my despised time\n"+
		"Is nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo,\n"+
		"Where didst thou see her? O unhappy girl!\n"+
		"With the Moor, say'st thou? Who would be a father!\n"+
		"How didst thou know 'twas she? O she deceives me\n"+
		"Past thought! What said she to you? Get more tapers:\n"+
		"Raise all my kindred. Are they married, think you?\n"+
		"RODERIGO\n"+
		"Truly, I think they are.\n"+
		"BRABANTIO\n"+
		"O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!\n"+
		"Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds\n"+
		"By what you see them act. Is there not charms\n"+
		"By which the property of youth and maidhood\n"+
		"May be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo,\n"+
		"Of some such thing?\n"+
		"RODERIGO\n"+
		"Yes, sir, I have indeed.\n"+
		"BRABANTIO\n"+
		"Call up my brother. O, would you had had her!\n"+
		"Some one way, some another. Do you know\n"+
		"Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?\n"+
		"RODERIGO\n"+
		"I think I can discover him, if you please,\n"+
		"To get good guard and go along with me.\n"+
		"BRABANTIO\n"+
		"Pray you, lead on. At every house I'll call;\n"+
		"I may command at most. Get weapons, ho!\n"+
		"And raise some special officers of night.\n"+
		"On, good Roderigo: I'll deserve your pains.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. Another street.\n"+
		"Enter OTHELLO, IAGO, and Attendants with torches\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Though in the trade of war I have slain men,\n"+
		"Yet do I hold it very stuff o' the conscience\n"+
		"To do no contrived murder: I lack iniquity\n"+
		"Sometimes to do me service: nine or ten times\n"+
		"I had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"'Tis better as it is.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Nay, but he prated,\n"+
		"And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms\n"+
		"Against your honour\n"+
		"That, with the little godliness I have,\n"+
		"I did full hard forbear him. But, I pray you, sir,\n"+
		"Are you fast married? Be assured of this,\n"+
		"That the magnifico is much beloved,\n"+
		"And hath in his effect a voice potential\n"+
		"As double as the duke's: he will divorce you;\n"+
		"Or put upon you what restraint and grievance\n"+
		"The law, with all his might to enforce it on,\n"+
		"Will give him cable.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Let him do his spite:\n"+
		"My services which I have done the signiory\n"+
		"Shall out-tongue his complaints. 'Tis yet to know,--\n"+
		"Which, when I know that boasting is an honour,\n"+
		"I shall promulgate--I fetch my life and being\n"+
		"From men of royal siege, and my demerits\n"+
		"May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune\n"+
		"As this that I have reach'd: for know, Iago,\n"+
		"But that I love the gentle Desdemona,\n"+
		"I would not my unhoused free condition\n"+
		"Put into circumscription and confine\n"+
		"For the sea's worth. But, look! what lights come yond?\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Those are the raised father and his friends:\n"+
		"You were best go in.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Not I I must be found:\n"+
		"My parts, my title and my perfect soul\n"+
		"Shall manifest me rightly. Is it they?\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"By Janus, I think no.\n"+
		"Enter CASSIO, and certain Officers with torches\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"The servants of the duke, and my lieutenant.\n"+
		"The goodness of the night upon you, friends!\n"+
		"What is the news?\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"The duke does greet you, general,\n"+
		"And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance,\n"+
		"Even on the instant.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"What is the matter, think you?\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"Something from Cyprus as I may divine:\n"+
		"It is a business of some heat: the galleys\n"+
		"Have sent a dozen sequent messengers\n"+
		"This very night at one another's heels,\n"+
		"And many of the consuls, raised and met,\n"+
		"Are at the duke's already: you have been\n"+
		"hotly call'd for;\n"+
		"When, being not at your lodging to be found,\n"+
		"The senate hath sent about three several guests\n"+
		"To search you out.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"'Tis well I am found by you.\n"+
		"I will but spend a word here in the house,\n"+
		"And go with you.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"Ancient, what makes he here?\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"'Faith, he to-night hath boarded a land carack:\n"+
		"If it prove lawful prize, he's made for ever.\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"I do not understand.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"He's married.\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"To who?\n"+
		"Re-enter OTHELLO\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Marry, to--Come, captain, will you go?\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Have with you.\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"Here comes another troop to seek for you.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"It is Brabantio. General, be advised;\n"+
		"He comes to bad intent.\n"+
		"Enter BRABANTIO, RODERIGO, and Officers with torches and weapons\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Holla! stand there!\n"+
		"RODERIGO\n"+
		"Signior, it is the Moor.\n"+
		"BRABANTIO\n"+
		"Down with him, thief!\n"+
		"They draw on both sides\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"You, Roderigo! come, sir, I am for you.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them.\n"+
		"Good signior, you shall more command with years\n"+
		"Than with your weapons.\n"+
		"BRABANTIO\n"+
		"O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow'd my daughter?\n"+
		"Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchanted her;\n"+
		"For I'll refer me to all things of sense,\n"+
		"If she in chains of magic were not bound,\n"+
		"Whether a maid so tender, fair and happy,\n"+
		"So opposite to marriage that she shunned\n"+
		"The wealthy curled darlings of our nation,\n"+
		"Would ever have, to incur a general mock,\n"+
		"Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom\n"+
		"Of such a thing as thou, to fear, not to delight.\n"+
		"Judge me the world, if 'tis not gross in sense\n"+
		"That thou hast practised on her with foul charms,\n"+
		"Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals\n"+
		"That weaken motion: I'll have't disputed on;\n"+
		"'Tis probable and palpable to thinking.\n"+
		"I therefore apprehend and do attach thee\n"+
		"For an abuser of the world, a practiser\n"+
		"Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.\n"+
		"Lay hold upon him: if he do resist,\n"+
		"Subdue him at his peril.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Hold your hands,\n"+
		"Both you of my inclining, and the rest:\n"+
		"Were it my cue to fight, I should have known it\n"+
		"Without a prompter. Where will you that I go\n"+
		"To answer this your charge?\n"+
		"BRABANTIO\n"+
		"To prison, till fit time\n"+
		"Of law and course of direct session\n"+
		"Call thee to answer.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"What if I do obey?\n"+
		"How may the duke be therewith satisfied,\n"+
		"Whose messengers are here about my side,\n"+
		"Upon some present business of the state\n"+
		"To bring me to him?\n"+
		"First Officer\n"+
		"'Tis true, most worthy signior;\n"+
		"The duke's in council and your noble self,\n"+
		"I am sure, is sent for.\n"+
		"BRABANTIO\n"+
		"How! the duke in council!\n"+
		"In this time of the night! Bring him away:\n"+
		"Mine's not an idle cause: the duke himself,\n"+
		"Or any of my brothers of the state,\n"+
		"Cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own;\n"+
		"For if such actions may have passage free,\n"+
		"Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. A council-chamber.\n"+
		"The DUKE and Senators sitting at a table; Officers attending\n"+
		"DUKE OF VENICE\n"+
		"There is no composition in these news\n"+
		"That gives them credit.\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"Indeed, they are disproportion'd;\n"+
		"My letters say a hundred and seven galleys.\n"+
		"DUKE OF VENICE\n"+
		"And mine, a hundred and forty.\n"+
		"Second Senator\n"+
		"And mine, two hundred:\n"+
		"But though they jump not on a just account,--\n"+
		"As in these cases, where the aim reports,\n"+
		"'Tis oft with difference--yet do they all confirm\n"+
		"A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.\n"+
		"DUKE OF VENICE\n"+
		"Nay, it is possible enough to judgment:\n"+
		"I do not so secure me in the error,\n"+
		"But the main article I do approve\n"+
		"In fearful sense.\n"+
		"Sailor\n"+
		"[Within] What, ho! what, ho! what, ho!\n"+
		"First Officer\n"+
		"A messenger from the galleys.\n"+
		"Enter a Sailor\n"+
		"DUKE OF VENICE\n"+
		"Now, what's the business?\n"+
		"Sailor\n"+
		"The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes;\n"+
		"So was I bid report here to the state\n"+
		"By Signior Angelo.\n"+
		"DUKE OF VENICE\n"+
		"How say you by this change?\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"This cannot be,\n"+
		"By no assay of reason: 'tis a pageant,\n"+
		"To keep us in false gaze. When we consider\n"+
		"The importancy of Cyprus to the Turk,\n"+
		"And let ourselves again but understand,\n"+
		"That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes,\n"+
		"So may he with more facile question bear it,\n"+
		"For that it stands not in such warlike brace,\n"+
		"But altogether lacks the abilities\n"+
		"That Rhodes is dress'd in: if we make thought of this,\n"+
		"We must not think the Turk is so unskilful\n"+
		"To leave that latest which concerns him first,\n"+
		"Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain,\n"+
		"To wake and wage a danger profitless.\n"+
		"DUKE OF VENICE\n"+
		"Nay, in all confidence, he's not for Rhodes.\n"+
		"First Officer\n"+
		"Here is more news.\n"+
		"Enter a Messenger\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"The Ottomites, reverend and gracious,\n"+
		"Steering with due course towards the isle of Rhodes,\n"+
		"Have there injointed them with an after fleet.\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"Ay, so I thought. How many, as you guess?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Of thirty sail: and now they do restem\n"+
		"Their backward course, bearing with frank appearance\n"+
		"Their purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano,\n"+
		"Your trusty and most valiant servitor,\n"+
		"With his free duty recommends you thus,\n"+
		"And prays you to believe him.\n"+
		"DUKE OF VENICE\n"+
		"'Tis certain, then, for Cyprus.\n"+
		"Marcus Luccicos, is not he in town?\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"He's now in Florence.\n"+
		"DUKE OF VENICE\n"+
		"Write from us to him; post-post-haste dispatch.\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.\n"+
		"Enter BRABANTIO, OTHELLO, IAGO, RODERIGO, and Officers\n"+
		"DUKE OF VENICE\n"+
		"Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you\n"+
		"Against the general enemy Ottoman.\n"+
		"To BRABANTIO\n"+
		"I did not see you; welcome, gentle signior;\n"+
		"We lack'd your counsel and your help tonight.\n"+
		"BRABANTIO\n"+
		"So did I yours. Good your grace, pardon me;\n"+
		"Neither my place nor aught I heard of business\n"+
		"Hath raised me from my bed, nor doth the general care\n"+
		"Take hold on me, for my particular grief\n"+
		"Is of so flood-gate and o'erbearing nature\n"+
		"That it engluts and swallows other sorrows\n"+
		"And it is still itself.\n"+
		"DUKE OF VENICE\n"+
		"Why, what's the matter?\n"+
		"BRABANTIO\n"+
		"My daughter! O, my daughter!\n"+
		"DUKE OF VENICE\n"+
		"Senator\n"+
		"Dead?\n"+
		"BRABANTIO\n"+
		"Ay, to me;\n"+
		"She is abused, stol'n from me, and corrupted\n"+
		"By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks;\n"+
		"For nature so preposterously to err,\n"+
		"Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense,\n"+
		"Sans witchcraft could not.\n"+
		"DUKE OF VENICE\n"+
		"Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding\n"+
		"Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself\n"+
		"And you of her, the bloody book of law\n"+
		"You shall yourself read in the bitter letter\n"+
		"After your own sense, yea, though our proper son\n"+
		"Stood in your action.\n"+
		"BRABANTIO\n"+
		"Humbly I thank your grace.\n"+
		"Here is the man, this Moor, whom now, it seems,\n"+
		"Your special mandate for the state-affairs\n"+
		"Hath hither brought.\n"+
		"DUKE OF VENICE\n"+
		"Senator\n"+
		"We are very sorry for't.\n"+
		"DUKE OF VENICE\n"+
		"[To OTHELLO] What, in your own part, can you say to this?\n"+
		"BRABANTIO\n"+
		"Nothing, but this is so.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,\n"+
		"My very noble and approved good masters,\n"+
		"That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter,\n"+
		"It is most true; true, I have married her:\n"+
		"The very head and front of my offending\n"+
		"Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,\n"+
		"And little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace:\n"+
		"For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith,\n"+
		"Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used\n"+
		"Their dearest action in the tented field,\n"+
		"And little of this great world can I speak,\n"+
		"More than pertains to feats of broil and battle,\n"+
		"And therefore little shall I grace my cause\n"+
		"In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,\n"+
		"I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver\n"+
		"Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,\n"+
		"What conjuration and what mighty magic,\n"+
		"For such proceeding I am charged withal,\n"+
		"I won his daughter.\n"+
		"BRABANTIO\n"+
		"A maiden never bold;\n"+
		"Of spirit so still and quiet, that her motion\n"+
		"Blush'd at herself; and she, in spite of nature,\n"+

		"That I have passed.\n"+
		"I ran it through, even from my boyish days,\n"+
		"To the very moment that he bade me tell it;\n"+

		"Of hair-breadth scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,\n"+

		"She'ld come again, and with a greedy ear\n"+

		"Took once a pliant hour, and found good means\n"+
		"To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart\n"+
		"That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,\n"+
		"Whereof by parcels she had something heard,\n"+
		"But not intentively: I did consent,\n"+
		"And often did beguile her of her tears,\n"+
		"When I did speak of some distressful stroke\n"+

		"She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd\n"+
		"That heaven had made her such a man: she thank'd me,\n"+
		"And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,\n"+
		"I should but teach him how to tell my story.\n"+
		"And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:\n"+
		"She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,\n"+
		"And I loved her that she did pity them.\n"+

		"IAGO\n"+
		"O villainous! I have looked upon the world for four\n"+
		"times seven years; and since I could distinguish\n"+
		"betwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found man\n"+
		"that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say, I\n"+

		"would change my humanity with a baboon.\n"+
		"RODERIGO\n"+
		"What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so\n"+
		"fond; but it is not in my virtue to amend it.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Virtue! a fig! 'tis in ourselves that we are thus\n"+
		"or thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which\n"+
		"our wills are gardeners: so that if we will plant\n"+
		"nettles, or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up\n"+
		"thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs, or\n"+
		"distract it with many, either to have it sterile\n"+
		"with idleness, or manured with industry, why, the\n"+
		"power and corrigible authority of this lies in our\n"+
		"wills. If the balance of our lives had not one\n"+
		"scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the\n"+
		"blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us\n"+
		"to most preposterous conclusions: but we have\n"+
		"reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal\n"+
		"stings, our unbitted lusts, whereof I take this that\n"+
		"you call love to be a sect or scion.\n"+
		"RODERIGO\n"+
		"It cannot be.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of\n"+
		"the will. Come, be a man. Drown thyself! drown\n"+
		"cats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy\n"+
		"friend and I confess me knit to thy deserving with\n"+
		"cables of perdurable toughness; I could never\n"+
		"better stead thee than now. Put money in thy\n"+
		"purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favour with\n"+
		"an usurped beard; I say, put money in thy purse. It\n"+
		"cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her\n"+
		"love to the Moor,-- put money in thy purse,--nor he\n"+
		"his to her: it was a violent commencement, and thou\n"+
		"shalt see an answerable sequestration:--put but\n"+
		"money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in\n"+
		"their wills: fill thy purse with money:--the food\n"+
		"that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be\n"+
		"to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida. She must\n"+
		"change for youth: when she is sated with his body,\n"+
		"she will find the error of her choice: she must\n"+
		"have change, she must: therefore put money in thy\n"+
		"purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a\n"+
		"more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money\n"+
		"thou canst: if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt\n"+
		"an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian not\n"+
		"too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou\n"+
		"shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of\n"+
		"drowning thyself! it is clean out of the way: seek\n"+
		"thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than\n"+
		"to be drowned and go without her.\n"+
		"RODERIGO\n"+
		"Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on\n"+
		"the issue?\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Thou art sure of me:--go, make money:--I have told\n"+
		"thee often, and I re-tell thee again and again, I\n"+
		"hate the Moor: my cause is hearted; thine hath no\n"+
		"less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge\n"+
		"against him: if thou canst cuckold him, thou dost\n"+
		"thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many\n"+
		"events in the womb of time which will be delivered.\n"+
		"Traverse! go, provide thy money. We will have more\n"+
		"of this to-morrow. Adieu.\n"+
		"RODERIGO\n"+
		"Where shall we meet i' the morning?\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"At my lodging.\n"+
		"RODERIGO\n"+
		"I'll be with thee betimes.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Go to; farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo?\n"+
		"RODERIGO\n"+
		"What say you?\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"No more of drowning, do you hear?\n"+
		"RODERIGO\n"+
		"I am changed: I'll go sell all my land.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Thus do I ever make my fool my purse:\n"+
		"For I mine own gain'd knowledge should profane,\n"+
		"If I would time expend with such a snipe.\n"+
		"But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor:\n"+
		"And it is thought abroad, that 'twixt my sheets\n"+
		"He has done my office: I know not if't be true;\n"+
		"But I, for mere suspicion in that kind,\n"+
		"Will do as if for surety. He holds me well;\n"+
		"The better shall my purpose work on him.\n"+
		"Cassio's a proper man: let me see now:\n"+
		"To get his place and to plume up my will\n"+
		"In double knavery--How, how? Let's see:--\n"+
		"After some time, to abuse Othello's ear\n"+
		"That he is too familiar with his wife.\n"+
		"He hath a person and a smooth dispose\n"+
		"To be suspected, framed to make women false.\n"+
		"The Moor is of a free and open nature,\n"+
		"That thinks men honest that but seem to be so,\n"+
		"And will as tenderly be led by the nose\n"+
		"As asses are.\n"+
		"I have't. It is engender'd. Hell and night\n"+
		"Must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"ACT II\n"+
		"SCENE I. A Sea-port in Cyprus. An open place near the quay.\n"+
		"Enter MONTANO and two Gentlemen\n"+
		"MONTANO\n"+
		"What from the cape can you discern at sea?\n"+
		"First Gentleman\n"+
		"Nothing at all: it is a highwrought flood;\n"+
		"I cannot, 'twixt the heaven and the main,\n"+
		"Descry a sail.\n"+
		"MONTANO\n"+
		"Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land;\n"+
		"A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements:\n"+
		"If it hath ruffian'd so upon the sea,\n"+
		"What ribs of oak, when mountains melt on them,\n"+
		"Can hold the mortise? What shall we hear of this?\n"+
		"Second Gentleman\n"+
		"A segregation of the Turkish fleet:\n"+
		"For do but stand upon the foaming shore,\n"+
		"The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds;\n"+
		"The wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous mane,\n"+
		"seems to cast water on the burning bear,\n"+
		"And quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole:\n"+
		"I never did like molestation view\n"+
		"On the enchafed flood.\n"+
		"MONTANO\n"+
		"If that the Turkish fleet\n"+
		"Be not enshelter'd and embay'd, they are drown'd:\n"+
		"It is impossible they bear it out.\n"+
		"Enter a third Gentleman\n"+
		"Third Gentleman\n"+
		"News, lads! our wars are done.\n"+
		"The desperate tempest hath so bang'd the Turks,\n"+
		"That their designment halts: a noble ship of Venice\n"+
		"Hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance\n"+
		"On most part of their fleet.\n"+
		"MONTANO\n"+
		"How! is this true?\n"+
		"Third Gentleman\n"+
		"The ship is here put in,\n"+
		"A Veronesa; Michael Cassio,\n"+
		"Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello,\n"+
		"Is come on shore: the Moor himself at sea,\n"+
		"And is in full commission here for Cyprus.\n"+
		"MONTANO\n"+
		"I am glad on't; 'tis a worthy governor.\n"+
		"Third Gentleman\n"+
		"But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort\n"+
		"Touching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly,\n"+
		"And prays the Moor be safe; for they were parted\n"+
		"With foul and violent tempest.\n"+
		"MONTANO\n"+
		"Pray heavens he be;\n"+
		"For I have served him, and the man commands\n"+
		"Like a full soldier. Let's to the seaside, ho!\n"+
		"As well to see the vessel that's come in\n"+
		"As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello,\n"+
		"Even till we make the main and the aerial blue\n"+
		"An indistinct regard.\n"+
		"Third Gentleman\n"+
		"Come, let's do so:\n"+
		"For every minute is expectancy\n"+
		"Of more arrivance.\n"+
		"Enter CASSIO\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle,\n"+
		"That so approve the Moor! O, let the heavens\n"+
		"Give him defence against the elements,\n"+
		"For I have lost us him on a dangerous sea.\n"+
		"MONTANO\n"+
		"Is he well shipp'd?\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"His bark is stoutly timber'd, his pilot\n"+
		"Of very expert and approved allowance;\n"+
		"Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death,\n"+
		"Stand in bold cure.\n"+
		"A cry within 'A sail, a sail, a sail!'\n"+
		"Enter a fourth Gentleman\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"What noise?\n"+
		"Fourth Gentleman\n"+
		"The town is empty; on the brow o' the sea\n"+
		"Stand ranks of people, and they cry 'A sail!'\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"My hopes do shape him for the governor.\n"+
		"Guns heard\n"+
		"Second Gentlemen\n"+
		"They do discharge their shot of courtesy:\n"+
		"Our friends at least.\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"I pray you, sir, go forth,\n"+
		"And give us truth who 'tis that is arrived.\n"+
		"Second Gentleman\n"+
		"I shall.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"MONTANO\n"+
		"But, good lieutenant, is your general wived?\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"Most fortunately: he hath achieved a maid\n"+
		"That paragons description and wild fame;\n"+
		"One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,\n"+
		"And in the essential vesture of creation\n"+
		"Does tire the ingener.\n"+
		"Re-enter second Gentleman\n"+
		"How now! who has put in?\n"+
		"Second Gentleman\n"+
		"'Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"Has had most favourable and happy speed:\n"+
		"Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds,\n"+
		"The gutter'd rocks and congregated sands--\n"+
		"Traitors ensteep'd to clog the guiltless keel,--\n"+
		"As having sense of beauty, do omit\n"+
		"Their mortal natures, letting go safely by\n"+
		"The divine Desdemona.\n"+
		"MONTANO\n"+
		"What is she?\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"She that I spake of, our great captain's captain,\n"+
		"Left in the conduct of the bold Iago,\n"+
		"Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts\n"+
		"A se'nnight's speed. Great Jove, Othello guard,\n"+
		"And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath,\n"+
		"That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,\n"+
		"Make love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms,\n"+
		"Give renew'd fire to our extincted spirits\n"+
		"And bring all Cyprus comfort!\n"+
		"Enter DESDEMONA, EMILIA, IAGO, RODERIGO, and Attendants\n"+
		"O, behold,\n"+
		"The riches of the ship is come on shore!\n"+
		"Ye men of Cyprus, let her have your knees.\n"+
		"Hail to thee, lady! and the grace of heaven,\n"+
		"Before, behind thee, and on every hand,\n"+
		"Enwheel thee round!\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"I thank you, valiant Cassio.\n"+
		"What tidings can you tell me of my lord?\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"He is not yet arrived: nor know I aught\n"+
		"But that he's well and will be shortly here.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"O, but I fear--How lost you company?\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"The great contention of the sea and skies\n"+
		"Parted our fellowship--But, hark! a sail.\n"+
		"Within 'A sail, a sail!' Guns heard\n"+
		"Second Gentleman\n"+
		"They give their greeting to the citadel;\n"+
		"This likewise is a friend.\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"See for the news.\n"+
		"Exit Gentleman\n"+
		"Good ancient, you are welcome.\n"+
		"To EMILIA\n"+
		"Welcome, mistress.\n"+
		"Let it not gall your patience, good Iago,\n"+
		"That I extend my manners; 'tis my breeding\n"+
		"That gives me this bold show of courtesy.\n"+
		"Kissing her\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Sir, would she give you so much of her lips\n"+
		"As of her tongue she oft bestows on me,\n"+
		"You'll have enough.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"Alas, she has no speech.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"In faith, too much;\n"+
		"I find it still, when I have list to sleep:\n"+
		"Marry, before your ladyship, I grant,\n"+
		"She puts her tongue a little in her heart,\n"+
		"And chides with thinking.\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"You have little cause to say so.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Come on, come on; you are pictures out of doors,\n"+

		"IAGO\n"+

		"Ay, madam.\n"+

		"I am not merry; but I do beguile\n"+

		"Worse and worse.\n"+

		"It gives me wonder great as my content\n"+
		"To see you here before me. O my soul's joy!\n"+
		"If after every tempest come such calms,\n"+
		"May the winds blow till they have waken'd death!\n"+
		"And let the labouring bark climb hills of seas\n"+
		"Olympus-high and duck again as low\n"+
		"As hell's from heaven! If it were now to die,\n"+
		"'Twere now to be most happy; for, I fear,\n"+
		"My soul hath her content so absolute\n"+
		"That not another comfort like to this\n"+
		"Succeeds in unknown fate.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"The heavens forbid\n"+
		"But that our loves and comforts should increase,\n"+
		"Even as our days do grow!\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Amen to that, sweet powers!\n"+
		"I cannot speak enough of this content;\n"+
		"It stops me here; it is too much of joy:\n"+
		"And this, and this, the greatest discords be\n"+
		"Kissing her\n"+
		"That e'er our hearts shall make!\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"[Aside] O, you are well tuned now!\n"+
		"But I'll set down the pegs that make this music,\n"+
		"As honest as I am.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Come, let us to the castle.\n"+
		"News, friends; our wars are done, the Turks\n"+
		"are drown'd.\n"+
		"How does my old acquaintance of this isle?\n"+
		"Honey, you shall be well desired in Cyprus;\n"+
		"I have found great love amongst them. O my sweet,\n"+
		"I prattle out of fashion, and I dote\n"+
		"In mine own comforts. I prithee, good Iago,\n"+
		"Go to the bay and disembark my coffers:\n"+
		"Bring thou the master to the citadel;\n"+
		"He is a good one, and his worthiness\n"+
		"Does challenge much respect. Come, Desdemona,\n"+
		"Once more, well met at Cyprus.\n"+
		"Exeunt OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, and Attendants\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Do thou meet me presently at the harbour. Come\n"+
		"hither. If thou be'st valiant,-- as, they say, base\n"+
		"men being in love have then a nobility in their\n"+
		"natures more than is native to them--list me. The\n"+
		"lieutenant tonight watches on the court of\n"+
		"guard:--first, I must tell thee this--Desdemona is\n"+
		"directly in love with him.\n"+
		"RODERIGO\n"+
		"With him! why, 'tis not possible.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed.\n"+
		"Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor,\n"+
		"but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies:\n"+
		"and will she love him still for prating? let not\n"+
		"thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed;\n"+
		"and what delight shall she have to look on the\n"+
		"devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of\n"+
		"sport, there should be, again to inflame it and to\n"+
		"give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favour,\n"+
		"sympathy in years, manners and beauties; all which\n"+
		"the Moor is defective in: now, for want of these\n"+
		"required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will\n"+
		"find itself abused, begin to heave the gorge,\n"+
		"disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature will\n"+
		"instruct her in it and compel her to some second\n"+
		"choice. Now, sir, this granted,--as it is a most\n"+
		"pregnant and unforced position--who stands so\n"+
		"eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio\n"+
		"does? a knave very voluble; no further\n"+
		"conscionable than in putting on the mere form of\n"+
		"civil and humane seeming, for the better compassing\n"+
		"of his salt and most hidden loose affection? why,\n"+
		"none; why, none: a slipper and subtle knave, a\n"+
		"finder of occasions, that has an eye can stamp and\n"+
		"counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never\n"+
		"present itself; a devilish knave. Besides, the\n"+
		"knave is handsome, young, and hath all those\n"+
		"requisites in him that folly and green minds look\n"+
		"after: a pestilent complete knave; and the woman\n"+
		"hath found him already.\n"+
		"RODERIGO\n"+
		"I cannot believe that in her; she's full of\n"+
		"most blessed condition.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Blessed fig's-end! the wine she drinks is made of\n"+
		"grapes: if she had been blessed, she would never\n"+
		"have loved the Moor. Blessed pudding! Didst thou\n"+
		"not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? didst\n"+
		"not mark that?\n"+
		"RODERIGO\n"+
		"Yes, that I did; but that was but courtesy.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Lechery, by this hand; an index and obscure prologue\n"+
		"to the history of lust and foul thoughts. They met\n"+
		"so near with their lips that their breaths embraced\n"+
		"together. Villanous thoughts, Roderigo! when these\n"+
		"mutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand comes\n"+
		"the master and main exercise, the incorporate\n"+
		"conclusion, Pish! But, sir, be you ruled by me: I\n"+
		"have brought you from Venice. Watch you to-night;\n"+
		"for the command, I'll lay't upon you. Cassio knows\n"+
		"you not. I'll not be far from you: do you find\n"+
		"some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking\n"+
		"too loud, or tainting his discipline; or from what\n"+
		"other course you please, which the time shall more\n"+
		"favourably minister.\n"+
		"RODERIGO\n"+
		"Well.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Sir, he is rash and very sudden in choler, and haply\n"+
		"may strike at you: provoke him, that he may; for\n"+
		"even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to\n"+
		"mutiny; whose qualification shall come into no true\n"+
		"taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So\n"+
		"shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by\n"+
		"the means I shall then have to prefer them; and the\n"+
		"impediment most profitably removed, without the\n"+
		"which there were no expectation of our prosperity.\n"+
		"RODERIGO\n"+
		"I will do this, if I can bring it to any\n"+
		"opportunity.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"I warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel:\n"+
		"I must fetch his necessaries ashore. Farewell.\n"+
		"RODERIGO\n"+
		"Adieu.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"That Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;\n"+
		"That she loves him, 'tis apt and of great credit:\n"+
		"The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,\n"+
		"Is of a constant, loving, noble nature,\n"+
		"And I dare think he'll prove to Desdemona\n"+
		"A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too;\n"+
		"Not out of absolute lust, though peradventure\n"+
		"I stand accountant for as great a sin,\n"+
		"But partly led to diet my revenge,\n"+
		"For that I do suspect the lusty Moor\n"+
		"Hath leap'd into my seat; the thought whereof\n"+
		"Doth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards;\n"+
		"And nothing can or shall content my soul\n"+
		"Till I am even'd with him, wife for wife,\n"+
		"Or failing so, yet that I put the Moor\n"+
		"At least into a jealousy so strong\n"+
		"That judgment cannot cure. Which thing to do,\n"+
		"If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trash\n"+
		"For his quick hunting, stand the putting on,\n"+
		"I'll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,\n"+
		"Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb--\n"+
		"For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too--\n"+
		"Make the Moor thank me, love me and reward me.\n"+
		"For making him egregiously an ass\n"+
		"And practising upon his peace and quiet\n"+
		"Even to madness. 'Tis here, but yet confused:\n"+
		"Knavery's plain face is never seen tin used.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE II. A street.\n"+
		"Enter a Herald with a proclamation; People following\n"+
		"Herald\n"+
		"It is Othello's pleasure, our noble and valiant\n"+
		"general, that, upon certain tidings now arrived,\n"+
		"importing the mere perdition of the Turkish fleet,\n"+
		"every man put himself into triumph; some to dance,\n"+
		"some to make bonfires, each man to what sport and\n"+
		"revels his addiction leads him: for, besides these\n"+
		"beneficial news, it is the celebration of his\n"+
		"nuptial. So much was his pleasure should be\n"+
		"proclaimed. All offices are open, and there is full\n"+
		"liberty of feasting from this present hour of five\n"+
		"till the bell have told eleven. Heaven bless the\n"+
		"isle of Cyprus and our noble general Othello!\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. A hall in the castle.\n"+
		"Enter OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, CASSIO, and Attendants\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Good Michael, look you to the guard to-night:\n"+
		"Let's teach ourselves that honourable stop,\n"+
		"Not to outsport discretion.\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"Iago hath direction what to do;\n"+
		"But, notwithstanding, with my personal eye\n"+
		"Will I look to't.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Iago is most honest.\n"+
		"Michael, good night: to-morrow with your earliest\n"+
		"Let me have speech with you.\n"+
		"To DESDEMONA\n"+
		"Come, my dear love,\n"+
		"The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue;\n"+
		"That profit's yet to come 'tween me and you.\n"+
		"Good night.\n"+
		"Exeunt OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, and Attendants\n"+
		"Enter IAGO\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"Welcome, Iago; we must to the watch.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Not this hour, lieutenant; 'tis not yet ten o' the\n"+
		"clock. Our general cast us thus early for the love\n"+
		"of his Desdemona; who let us not therefore blame:\n"+
		"he hath not yet made wanton the night with her; and\n"+
		"she is sport for Jove.\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"She's a most exquisite lady.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"And, I'll warrant her, fun of game.\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"Indeed, she's a most fresh and delicate creature.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"What an eye she has! methinks it sounds a parley of\n"+
		"provocation.\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"An inviting eye; and yet methinks right modest.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"She is indeed perfection.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Well, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant, I\n"+
		"have a stoup of wine; and here without are a brace\n"+
		"of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to\n"+
		"the health of black Othello.\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"Not to-night, good Iago: I have very poor and\n"+
		"unhappy brains for drinking: I could well wish\n"+
		"courtesy would invent some other custom of\n"+
		"entertainment.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"O, they are our friends; but one cup: I'll drink for\n"+
		"you.\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"I have drunk but one cup to-night, and that was\n"+
		"craftily qualified too, and, behold, what innovation\n"+
		"it makes here: I am unfortunate in the infirmity,\n"+
		"and dare not task my weakness with any more.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"What, man! 'tis a night of revels: the gallants\n"+
		"desire it.\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"Where are they?\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Here at the door; I pray you, call them in.\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"I'll do't; but it dislikes me.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"If I can fasten but one cup upon him,\n"+
		"With that which he hath drunk to-night already,\n"+
		"He'll be as full of quarrel and offence\n"+
		"As my young mistress' dog. Now, my sick fool Roderigo,\n"+
		"Whom love hath turn'd almost the wrong side out,\n"+
		"To Desdemona hath to-night caroused\n"+
		"Potations pottle-deep; and he's to watch:\n"+
		"Three lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits,\n"+
		"That hold their honours in a wary distance,\n"+
		"The very elements of this warlike isle,\n"+
		"Have I to-night fluster'd with flowing cups,\n"+
		"And they watch too. Now, 'mongst this flock of drunkards,\n"+
		"Am I to put our Cassio in some action\n"+
		"That may offend the isle.--But here they come:\n"+
		"If consequence do but approve my dream,\n"+
		"My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.\n"+
		"Re-enter CASSIO; with him MONTANO and Gentlemen; servants following with wine\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"'Fore God, they have given me a rouse already.\n"+
		"MONTANO\n"+
		"Good faith, a little one; not past a pint, as I am\n"+
		"a soldier.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Some wine, ho!\n"+
		"Sings\n"+
		"And let me the canakin clink, clink;\n"+
		"And let me the canakin clink\n"+
		"A soldier's a man;\n"+
		"A life's but a span;\n"+
		"Why, then, let a soldier drink.\n"+
		"Some wine, boys!\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"'Fore God, an excellent song.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"I learned it in England, where, indeed, they are\n"+
		"most potent in potting: your Dane, your German, and\n"+
		"your swag-bellied Hollander--Drink, ho!--are nothing\n"+
		"to your English.\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking?\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Why, he drinks you, with facility, your Dane dead\n"+
		"drunk; he sweats not to overthrow your Almain; he\n"+
		"gives your Hollander a vomit, ere the next pottle\n"+
		"can be filled.\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"To the health of our general!\n"+
		"MONTANO\n"+
		"I am for it, lieutenant; and I'll do you justice.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"O sweet England!\n"+
		"King Stephen was a worthy peer,\n"+
		"His breeches cost him but a crown;\n"+
		"He held them sixpence all too dear,\n"+
		"With that he call'd the tailor lown.\n"+
		"He was a wight of high renown,\n"+
		"And thou art but of low degree:\n"+
		"'Tis pride that pulls the country down;\n"+
		"Then take thine auld cloak about thee.\n"+
		"Some wine, ho!\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"Why, this is a more exquisite song than the other.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Will you hear't again?\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"No; for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that\n"+
		"does those things. Well, God's above all; and there\n"+
		"be souls must be saved, and there be souls must not be saved.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"It's true, good lieutenant.\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"For mine own part,--no offence to the general, nor\n"+
		"any man of quality,--I hope to be saved.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"And so do I too, lieutenant.\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"Ay, but, by your leave, not before me; the\n"+
		"lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient. Let's\n"+
		"have no more of this; let's to our affairs.--Forgive\n"+
		"us our sins!--Gentlemen, let's look to our business.\n"+
		"Do not think, gentlemen. I am drunk: this is my\n"+
		"ancient; this is my right hand, and this is my left:\n"+
		"I am not drunk now; I can stand well enough, and\n"+
		"speak well enough.\n"+
		"All\n"+
		"Excellent well.\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"Why, very well then; you must not think then that I am drunk.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"MONTANO\n"+
		"To the platform, masters; come, let's set the watch.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"You see this fellow that is gone before;\n"+
		"He is a soldier fit to stand by Caesar\n"+
		"And give direction: and do but see his vice;\n"+
		"'Tis to his virtue a just equinox,\n"+
		"The one as long as the other: 'tis pity of him.\n"+
		"I fear the trust Othello puts him in.\n"+
		"On some odd time of his infirmity,\n"+
		"Will shake this island.\n"+
		"MONTANO\n"+
		"But is he often thus?\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"'Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep:\n"+
		"He'll watch the horologe a double set,\n"+
		"If drink rock not his cradle.\n"+
		"MONTANO\n"+
		"It were well\n"+

		"Perhaps he sees it not; or his good nature\n"+
		"Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio,\n"+
		"And looks not on his evils: is not this true?\n"+
		"Enter RODERIGO\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"[Aside to him] How now, Roderigo!\n"+
		"I pray you, after the lieutenant; go.\n"+
		"Exit RODERIGO\n"+
		"MONTANO\n"+
		"And 'tis great pity that the noble Moor\n"+

		"The gravity and stillness of your youth\n"+
		"The world hath noted, and your name is great\n"+
		"In mouths of wisest censure: what's the matter,\n"+
		"That you unlace your reputation thus\n"+
		"And spend your rich opinion for the name\n"+
		"Of a night-brawler? give me answer to it.\n"+
		"MONTANO\n"+
		"Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger:\n"+
		"Your officer, Iago, can inform you,--\n"+
		"While I spare speech, which something now\n"+
		"offends me,--\n"+
		"Of all that I do know: nor know I aught\n"+
		"By me that's said or done amiss this night;\n"+
		"Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice,\n"+
		"And to defend ourselves it be a sin\n"+
		"When violence assails us.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Now, by heaven,\n"+
		"My blood begins my safer guides to rule;\n"+
		"And passion, having my best judgment collied,\n"+
		"Assays to lead the way: if I once stir,\n"+
		"Or do but lift this arm, the best of you\n"+
		"Shall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know\n"+
		"How this foul rout began, who set it on;\n"+
		"And he that is approved in this offence,\n"+
		"Though he had twinn'd with me, both at a birth,\n"+
		"Shall lose me. What! in a town of war,\n"+
		"Yet wild, the people's hearts brimful of fear,\n"+
		"To manage private and domestic quarrel,\n"+
		"In night, and on the court and guard of safety!\n"+
		"'Tis monstrous. Iago, who began't?\n"+
		"MONTANO\n"+
		"If partially affined, or leagued in office,\n"+
		"Thou dost deliver more or less than truth,\n"+
		"Thou art no soldier.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Touch me not so near:\n"+
		"I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth\n"+
		"Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio;\n"+
		"Yet, I persuade myself, to speak the truth\n"+
		"Shall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general.\n"+
		"Montano and myself being in speech,\n"+
		"There comes a fellow crying out for help:\n"+
		"And Cassio following him with determined sword,\n"+
		"To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman\n"+
		"Steps in to Cassio, and entreats his pause:\n"+
		"Myself the crying fellow did pursue,\n"+
		"Lest by his clamour--as it so fell out--\n"+
		"The town might fall in fright: he, swift of foot,\n"+
		"Outran my purpose; and I return'd the rather\n"+
		"For that I heard the clink and fall of swords,\n"+
		"And Cassio high in oath; which till to-night\n"+
		"I ne'er might say before. When I came back--\n"+
		"For this was brief--I found them close together,\n"+
		"At blow and thrust; even as again they were\n"+
		"When you yourself did part them.\n"+
		"More of this matter cannot I report:\n"+
		"But men are men; the best sometimes forget:\n"+
		"Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,\n"+
		"As men in rage strike those that wish them best,\n"+
		"Yet surely Cassio, I believe, received\n"+
		"From him that fled some strange indignity,\n"+
		"Which patience could not pass.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"I know, Iago,\n"+
		"Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter,\n"+
		"Making it light to Cassio. Cassio, I love thee\n"+
		"But never more be officer of mine.\n"+
		"Re-enter DESDEMONA, attended\n"+
		"Look, if my gentle love be not raised up!\n"+
		"I'll make thee an example.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"What's the matter?\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"All's well now, sweeting; come away to bed.\n"+
		"Sir, for your hurts, myself will be your surgeon:\n"+
		"Lead him off.\n"+
		"To MONTANO, who is led off\n"+
		"Iago, look with care about the town,\n"+
		"And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted.\n"+
		"Come, Desdemona: 'tis the soldiers' life\n"+
		"To have their balmy slumbers waked with strife.\n"+
		"Exeunt all but IAGO and CASSIO\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"What, are you hurt, lieutenant?\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"Ay, past all surgery.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Marry, heaven forbid!\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"Reputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have lost\n"+
		"my reputation! I have lost the immortal part of\n"+
		"myself, and what remains is bestial. My reputation,\n"+
		"Iago, my reputation!\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"As I am an honest man, I thought you had received\n"+
		"some bodily wound; there is more sense in that than\n"+
		"in reputation. Reputation is an idle and most false\n"+
		"imposition: oft got without merit, and lost without\n"+
		"deserving: you have lost no reputation at all,\n"+
		"unless you repute yourself such a loser. What, man!\n"+
		"there are ways to recover the general again: you\n"+
		"are but now cast in his mood, a punishment more in\n"+
		"policy than in malice, even so as one would beat his\n"+
		"offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion: sue\n"+
		"to him again, and he's yours.\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so\n"+
		"good a commander with so slight, so drunken, and so\n"+
		"indiscreet an officer. Drunk? and speak parrot?\n"+
		"and squabble? swagger? swear? and discourse\n"+
		"fustian with one's own shadow? O thou invisible\n"+
		"spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by,\n"+
		"let us call thee devil!\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"What was he that you followed with your sword? What\n"+
		"had he done to you?\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"I know not.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Is't possible?\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly;\n"+
		"a quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O God, that men\n"+
		"should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away\n"+
		"their brains! that we should, with joy, pleasance\n"+
		"revel and applause, transform ourselves into beasts!\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Why, but you are now well enough: how came you thus\n"+
		"recovered?\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place\n"+
		"to the devil wrath; one unperfectness shows me\n"+
		"another, to make me frankly despise myself.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Come, you are too severe a moraler: as the time,\n"+
		"the place, and the condition of this country\n"+
		"stands, I could heartily wish this had not befallen;\n"+
		"but, since it is as it is, mend it for your own good.\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me\n"+
		"I am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra,\n"+
		"such an answer would stop them all. To be now a\n"+
		"sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a\n"+
		"beast! O strange! Every inordinate cup is\n"+
		"unblessed and the ingredient is a devil.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature,\n"+
		"if it be well used: exclaim no more against it.\n"+
		"And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"I have well approved it, sir. I drunk!\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"You or any man living may be drunk! at a time, man.\n"+
		"I'll tell you what you shall do. Our general's wife\n"+
		"is now the general: may say so in this respect, for\n"+
		"that he hath devoted and given up himself to the\n"+
		"contemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts and\n"+
		"graces: confess yourself freely to her; importune\n"+
		"her help to put you in your place again: she is of\n"+
		"so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition,\n"+
		"she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more\n"+
		"than she is requested: this broken joint between\n"+
		"you and her husband entreat her to splinter; and, my\n"+
		"fortunes against any lay worth naming, this\n"+
		"crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before.\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"You advise me well.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I will\n"+
		"beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me:\n"+
		"I am desperate of my fortunes if they cheque me here.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant; I\n"+
		"must to the watch.\n"+
		"CASSIO: Good night, honest Iago.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"And what's he then that says I play the villain?\n"+
		"When this advice is free I give and honest,\n"+
		"Probal to thinking and indeed the course\n"+
		"To win the Moor again? For 'tis most easy\n"+
		"The inclining Desdemona to subdue\n"+
		"In any honest suit: she's framed as fruitful\n"+
		"As the free elements. And then for her\n"+
		"To win the Moor--were't to renounce his baptism,\n"+
		"All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,\n"+
		"His soul is so enfetter'd to her love,\n"+
		"That she may make, unmake, do what she list,\n"+
		"Even as her appetite shall play the god\n"+
		"With his weak function. How am I then a villain\n"+
		"To counsel Cassio to this parallel course,\n"+
		"Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!\n"+
		"When devils will the blackest sins put on,\n"+
		"They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,\n"+
		"As I do now: for whiles this honest fool\n"+
		"Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes\n"+
		"And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,\n"+
		"I'll pour this pestilence into his ear,\n"+
		"That she repeals him for her body's lust;\n"+
		"And by how much she strives to do him good,\n"+
		"She shall undo her credit with the Moor.\n"+
		"So will I turn her virtue into pitch,\n"+
		"And out of her own goodness make the net\n"+
		"That shall enmesh them all.\n"+
		"Re-enter RODERIGO\n"+
		"How now, Roderigo!\n"+
		"RODERIGO\n"+
		"I do follow here in the chase, not like a hound that\n"+
		"hunts, but one that fills up the cry. My money is\n"+
		"almost spent; I have been to-night exceedingly well\n"+
		"cudgelled; and I think the issue will be, I shall\n"+
		"have so much experience for my pains, and so, with\n"+
		"no money at all and a little more wit, return again to Venice.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"How poor are they that have not patience!\n"+
		"What wound did ever heal but by degrees?\n"+
		"Thou know'st we work by wit, and not by witchcraft;\n"+
		"And wit depends on dilatory time.\n"+
		"Does't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee.\n"+
		"And thou, by that small hurt, hast cashier'd Cassio:\n"+
		"Though other things grow fair against the sun,\n"+
		"Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe:\n"+
		"Content thyself awhile. By the mass, 'tis morning;\n"+
		"Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.\n"+
		"Retire thee; go where thou art billeted:\n"+
		"Away, I say; thou shalt know more hereafter:\n"+
		"Nay, get thee gone.\n"+
		"Exit RODERIGO\n"+
		"Two things are to be done:\n"+
		"My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress;\n"+
		"I'll set her on;\n"+
		"Myself the while to draw the Moor apart,\n"+
		"And bring him jump when he may Cassio find\n"+
		"Soliciting his wife: ay, that's the way\n"+
		"Dull not device by coldness and delay.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"ACT III\n"+
		"SCENE I. Before the castle.\n"+
		"Enter CASSIO and some Musicians\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"Masters, play here; I will content your pains;\n"+
		"Something that's brief; and bid 'Good morrow, general.'\n"+
		"Music\n"+
		"Enter Clown\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Why masters, have your instruments been in Naples,\n"+
		"that they speak i' the nose thus?\n"+
		"First Musician\n"+
		"How, sir, how!\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Are these, I pray you, wind-instruments?\n"+
		"First Musician\n"+
		"Ay, marry, are they, sir.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"O, thereby hangs a tail.\n"+
		"First Musician\n"+
		"Whereby hangs a tale, sir?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Marry. sir, by many a wind-instrument that I know.\n"+
		"But, masters, here's money for you: and the general\n"+
		"so likes your music, that he desires you, for love's\n"+
		"sake, to make no more noise with it.\n"+
		"First Musician\n"+
		"Well, sir, we will not.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"If you have any music that may not be heard, to't\n"+
		"again: but, as they say to hear music the general\n"+
		"does not greatly care.\n"+
		"First Musician\n"+
		"We have none such, sir.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Then put up your pipes in your bag, for I'll away:\n"+
		"go; vanish into air; away!\n"+
		"Exeunt Musicians\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"Dost thou hear, my honest friend?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"No, I hear not your honest friend; I hear you.\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"Prithee, keep up thy quillets. There's a poor piece\n"+
		"of gold for thee: if the gentlewoman that attends\n"+
		"the general's wife be stirring, tell her there's\n"+
		"one Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech:\n"+
		"wilt thou do this?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"She is stirring, sir: if she will stir hither, I\n"+
		"shall seem to notify unto her.\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"Do, good my friend.\n"+
		"Exit Clown\n"+
		"Enter IAGO\n"+
		"In happy time, Iago.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"You have not been a-bed, then?\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"Why, no; the day had broke\n"+
		"Before we parted. I have made bold, Iago,\n"+
		"To send in to your wife: my suit to her\n"+
		"Is, that she will to virtuous Desdemona\n"+
		"Procure me some access.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"I'll send her to you presently;\n"+
		"And I'll devise a mean to draw the Moor\n"+
		"Out of the way, that your converse and business\n"+
		"May be more free.\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"I humbly thank you for't.\n"+
		"Exit IAGO\n"+
		"I never knew\n"+
		"A Florentine more kind and honest.\n"+
		"Enter EMILIA\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"Good morrow, good Lieutenant: I am sorry\n"+
		"For your displeasure; but all will sure be well.\n"+
		"The general and his wife are talking of it;\n"+
		"And she speaks for you stoutly: the Moor replies,\n"+
		"That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus,\n"+
		"And great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom\n"+
		"He might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you\n"+
		"And needs no other suitor but his likings\n"+
		"To take the safest occasion by the front\n"+
		"To bring you in again.\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"Yet, I beseech you,\n"+
		"If you think fit, or that it may be done,\n"+
		"Give me advantage of some brief discourse\n"+
		"With Desdemona alone.\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"Pray you, come in;\n"+
		"I will bestow you where you shall have time\n"+
		"To speak your bosom freely.\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"I am much bound to you.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. A room in the castle.\n"+
		"Enter OTHELLO, IAGO, and Gentlemen\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"These letters give, Iago, to the pilot;\n"+
		"And by him do my duties to the senate:\n"+
		"That done, I will be walking on the works;\n"+
		"Repair there to me.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Well, my good lord, I'll do't.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"This fortification, gentlemen, shall we see't?\n"+
		"Gentleman\n"+
		"We'll wait upon your lordship.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. The garden of the castle.\n"+
		"Enter DESDEMONA, CASSIO, and EMILIA\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will do\n"+
		"All my abilities in thy behalf.\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"Good madam, do: I warrant it grieves my husband,\n"+
		"As if the case were his.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"O, that's an honest fellow. Do not doubt, Cassio,\n"+
		"But I will have my lord and you again\n"+
		"As friendly as you were.\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"Bounteous madam,\n"+
		"Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio,\n"+
		"He's never any thing but your true servant.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"I know't; I thank you. You do love my lord:\n"+
		"You have known him long; and be you well assured\n"+
		"He shall in strangeness stand no further off\n"+
		"Than in a polite distance.\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"Ay, but, lady,\n"+
		"That policy may either last so long,\n"+
		"Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet,\n"+
		"Or breed itself so out of circumstance,\n"+
		"That, I being absent and my place supplied,\n"+
		"My general will forget my love and service.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"Do not doubt that; before Emilia here\n"+
		"I give thee warrant of thy place: assure thee,\n"+
		"If I do vow a friendship, I'll perform it\n"+
		"To the last article: my lord shall never rest;\n"+
		"I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience;\n"+
		"His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;\n"+
		"I'll intermingle every thing he does\n"+
		"With Cassio's suit: therefore be merry, Cassio;\n"+
		"For thy solicitor shall rather die\n"+
		"Than give thy cause away.\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"Madam, here comes my lord.\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"Madam, I'll take my leave.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"Why, stay, and hear me speak.\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"Madam, not now: I am very ill at ease,\n"+
		"Unfit for mine own purposes.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"Well, do your discretion.\n"+
		"Exit CASSIO\n"+
		"Enter OTHELLO and IAGO\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Ha! I like not that.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"What dost thou say?\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Nothing, my lord: or if--I know not what.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Cassio, my lord! No, sure, I cannot think it,\n"+
		"That he would steal away so guilty-like,\n"+
		"Seeing you coming.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"I do believe 'twas he.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"How now, my lord!\n"+
		"I have been talking with a suitor here,\n"+
		"A man that languishes in your displeasure.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Who is't you mean?\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,\n"+
		"If I have any grace or power to move you,\n"+
		"His present reconciliation take;\n"+
		"For if he be not one that truly loves you,\n"+
		"That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,\n"+
		"I have no judgment in an honest face:\n"+
		"I prithee, call him back.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Went he hence now?\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"Ay, sooth; so humbled\n"+
		"That he hath left part of his grief with me,\n"+
		"To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Not now, sweet Desdemona; some other time.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"But shall't be shortly?\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"The sooner, sweet, for you.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"Shall't be to-night at supper?\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"No, not to-night.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"To-morrow dinner, then?\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"I shall not dine at home;\n"+
		"I meet the captains at the citadel.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"Why, then, to-morrow night; or Tuesday morn;\n"+
		"On Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn:\n"+
		"I prithee, name the time, but let it not\n"+
		"Exceed three days: in faith, he's penitent;\n"+
		"And yet his trespass, in our common reason--\n"+
		"Save that, they say, the wars must make examples\n"+
		"Out of their best--is not almost a fault\n"+
		"To incur a private cheque. When shall he come?\n"+
		"Tell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul,\n"+
		"What you would ask me, that I should deny,\n"+
		"Or stand so mammering on. What! Michael Cassio,\n"+
		"That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,\n"+
		"When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,\n"+
		"Hath ta'en your part; to have so much to do\n"+
		"To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much,--\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Prithee, no more: let him come when he will;\n"+
		"I will deny thee nothing.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"Why, this is not a boon;\n"+
		"'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,\n"+
		"Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,\n"+
		"Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit\n"+
		"To your own person: nay, when I have a suit\n"+
		"Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,\n"+
		"It shall be full of poise and difficult weight\n"+
		"And fearful to be granted.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"I will deny thee nothing:\n"+
		"Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,\n"+
		"To leave me but a little to myself.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"Shall I deny you? no: farewell, my lord.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Farewell, my Desdemona: I'll come to thee straight.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"Emilia, come. Be as your fancies teach you;\n"+
		"Whate'er you be, I am obedient.\n"+
		"Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,\n"+
		"But I do love thee! and when I love thee not,\n"+
		"Chaos is come again.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"My noble lord--\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"What dost thou say, Iago?\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Did Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady,\n"+
		"Know of your love?\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"He did, from first to last: why dost thou ask?\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"But for a satisfaction of my thought;\n"+
		"No further harm.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Why of thy thought, Iago?\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"I did not think he had been acquainted with her.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"O, yes; and went between us very oft.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Indeed!\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Indeed! ay, indeed: discern'st thou aught in that?\n"+
		"Is he not honest?\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Honest, my lord!\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Honest! ay, honest.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"My lord, for aught I know.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"What dost thou think?\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Think, my lord!\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Think, my lord!\n"+
		"By heaven, he echoes me,\n"+
		"As if there were some monster in his thought\n"+
		"Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something:\n"+
		"I heard thee say even now, thou likedst not that,\n"+
		"When Cassio left my wife: what didst not like?\n"+
		"And when I told thee he was of my counsel\n"+
		"In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst 'Indeed!'\n"+
		"And didst contract and purse thy brow together,\n"+
		"As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain\n"+
		"Some horrible conceit: if thou dost love me,\n"+
		"Show me thy thought.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"My lord, you know I love you.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"I think thou dost;\n"+
		"And, for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty,\n"+
		"And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath,\n"+
		"Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more:\n"+
		"For such things in a false disloyal knave\n"+
		"Are tricks of custom, but in a man that's just\n"+
		"They are close delations, working from the heart\n"+
		"That passion cannot rule.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"For Michael Cassio,\n"+
		"I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"I think so too.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Men should be what they seem;\n"+
		"Or those that be not, would they might seem none!\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Certain, men should be what they seem.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Why, then, I think Cassio's an honest man.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Nay, yet there's more in this:\n"+
		"I prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,\n"+
		"As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts\n"+
		"The worst of words.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Good my lord, pardon me:\n"+
		"Though I am bound to every act of duty,\n"+
		"I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.\n"+
		"Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false;\n"+
		"As where's that palace whereinto foul things\n"+
		"Sometimes intrude not? who has a breast so pure,\n"+
		"But some uncleanly apprehensions\n"+
		"Keep leets and law-days and in session sit\n"+
		"With meditations lawful?\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,\n"+
		"If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear\n"+
		"A stranger to thy thoughts.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"I do beseech you--\n"+
		"Though I perchance am vicious in my guess,\n"+
		"As, I confess, it is my nature's plague\n"+
		"To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy\n"+
		"Shapes faults that are not--that your wisdom yet,\n"+
		"From one that so imperfectly conceits,\n"+
		"Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble\n"+
		"Out of his scattering and unsure observance.\n"+
		"It were not for your quiet nor your good,\n"+
		"Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom,\n"+
		"To let you know my thoughts.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"What dost thou mean?\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,\n"+
		"Is the immediate jewel of their souls:\n"+
		"Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing;\n"+
		"'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands:\n"+
		"But he that filches from me my good name\n"+
		"Robs me of that which not enriches him\n"+
		"And makes me poor indeed.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"You cannot, if my heart were in your hand;\n"+
		"Nor shall not, whilst 'tis in my custody.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Ha!\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"O, beware, my lord, of jealousy;\n"+
		"It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock\n"+
		"The meat it feeds on; that cuckold lives in bliss\n"+
		"Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;\n"+
		"But, O, what damned minutes tells he o'er\n"+
		"Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"O misery!\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Poor and content is rich and rich enough,\n"+
		"But riches fineless is as poor as winter\n"+
		"To him that ever fears he shall be poor.\n"+
		"Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend\n"+
		"From jealousy!\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Why, why is this?\n"+
		"Think'st thou I'ld make a lie of jealousy,\n"+
		"To follow still the changes of the moon\n"+
		"With fresh suspicions? No; to be once in doubt\n"+
		"Is once to be resolved: exchange me for a goat,\n"+
		"When I shall turn the business of my soul\n"+
		"To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,\n"+
		"Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me jealous\n"+
		"To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,\n"+
		"Is free of speech, sings, plays and dances well;\n"+
		"Where virtue is, these are more virtuous:\n"+
		"Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw\n"+
		"The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt;\n"+
		"For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago;\n"+
		"I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;\n"+
		"And on the proof, there is no more but this,--\n"+
		"Away at once with love or jealousy!\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"I am glad of it; for now I shall have reason\n"+
		"To show the love and duty that I bear you\n"+
		"With franker spirit: therefore, as I am bound,\n"+
		"Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.\n"+
		"Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;\n"+
		"Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure:\n"+
		"I would not have your free and noble nature,\n"+
		"Out of self-bounty, be abused; look to't:\n"+
		"I know our country disposition well;\n"+
		"In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks\n"+
		"They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience\n"+
		"Is not to leave't undone, but keep't unknown.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Dost thou say so?\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"She did deceive her father, marrying you;\n"+
		"And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks,\n"+
		"She loved them most.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"And so she did.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Why, go to then;\n"+
		"She that, so young, could give out such a seeming,\n"+
		"To seal her father's eyes up close as oak-\n"+
		"He thought 'twas witchcraft--but I am much to blame;\n"+
		"I humbly do beseech you of your pardon\n"+
		"For too much loving you.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"I am bound to thee for ever.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"I see this hath a little dash'd your spirits.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Not a jot, not a jot.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"I' faith, I fear it has.\n"+
		"I hope you will consider what is spoke\n"+
		"Comes from my love. But I do see you're moved:\n"+
		"I am to pray you not to strain my speech\n"+
		"To grosser issues nor to larger reach\n"+
		"Than to suspicion.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"I will not.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Should you do so, my lord,\n"+
		"My speech should fall into such vile success\n"+
		"As my thoughts aim not at. Cassio's my worthy friend--\n"+
		"My lord, I see you're moved.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"No, not much moved:\n"+
		"I do not think but Desdemona's honest.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Long live she so! and long live you to think so!\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"And yet, how nature erring from itself,--\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Ay, there's the point: as--to be bold with you--\n"+
		"Not to affect many proposed matches\n"+
		"Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,\n"+
		"Whereto we see in all things nature tends--\n"+
		"Foh! one may smell in such a will most rank,\n"+
		"Foul disproportion thoughts unnatural.\n"+
		"But pardon me; I do not in position\n"+
		"Distinctly speak of her; though I may fear\n"+
		"Her will, recoiling to her better judgment,\n"+
		"May fall to match you with her country forms\n"+
		"And happily repent.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Farewell, farewell:\n"+
		"If more thou dost perceive, let me know more;\n"+
		"Set on thy wife to observe: leave me, Iago:\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"[Going] My lord, I take my leave.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless\n"+
		"Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"[Returning] My lord, I would I might entreat\n"+
		"your honour\n"+
		"To scan this thing no further; leave it to time:\n"+
		"Though it be fit that Cassio have his place,\n"+
		"For sure, he fills it up with great ability,\n"+
		"Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile,\n"+
		"You shall by that perceive him and his means:\n"+
		"Note, if your lady strain his entertainment\n"+
		"With any strong or vehement importunity;\n"+
		"Much will be seen in that. In the mean time,\n"+
		"Let me be thought too busy in my fears--\n"+
		"As worthy cause I have to fear I am--\n"+
		"And hold her free, I do beseech your honour.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Fear not my government.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"I once more take my leave.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"This fellow's of exceeding honesty,\n"+
		"And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,\n"+
		"Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,\n"+
		"Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,\n"+
		"I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind,\n"+
		"To pray at fortune. Haply, for I am black\n"+
		"And have not those soft parts of conversation\n"+
		"That chamberers have, or for I am declined\n"+
		"Into the vale of years,--yet that's not much--\n"+
		"She's gone. I am abused; and my relief\n"+
		"Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,\n"+
		"That we can call these delicate creatures ours,\n"+
		"And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad,\n"+
		"And live upon the vapour of a dungeon,\n"+
		"Than keep a corner in the thing I love\n"+
		"For others' uses. Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones;\n"+
		"Prerogatived are they less than the base;\n"+
		"'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death:\n"+
		"Even then this forked plague is fated to us\n"+
		"When we do quicken. Desdemona comes:\n"+
		"Re-enter DESDEMONA and EMILIA\n"+
		"If she be false, O, then heaven mocks itself!\n"+
		"I'll not believe't.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"How now, my dear Othello!\n"+
		"Your dinner, and the generous islanders\n"+
		"By you invited, do attend your presence.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"I am to blame.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"Why do you speak so faintly?\n"+
		"Are you not well?\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"I have a pain upon my forehead here.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"'Faith, that's with watching; 'twill away again:\n"+
		"Let me but bind it hard, within this hour\n"+
		"It will be well.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Your napkin is too little:\n"+
		"He puts the handkerchief from him; and it drops\n"+
		"Let it alone. Come, I'll go in with you.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"I am very sorry that you are not well.\n"+
		"Exeunt OTHELLO and DESDEMONA\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"I am glad I have found this napkin:\n"+
		"This was her first remembrance from the Moor:\n"+
		"My wayward husband hath a hundred times\n"+
		"Woo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token,\n"+
		"For he conjured her she should ever keep it,\n"+
		"That she reserves it evermore about her\n"+
		"To kiss and talk to. I'll have the work ta'en out,\n"+
		"And give't Iago: what he will do with it\n"+
		"Heaven knows, not I;\n"+
		"I nothing but to please his fantasy.\n"+
		"Re-enter Iago\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"How now! what do you here alone?\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"Do not you chide; I have a thing for you.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"A thing for me? it is a common thing--\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"Ha!\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"To have a foolish wife.\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"O, is that all? What will you give me now\n"+
		"For the same handkerchief?\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"What handkerchief?\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"What handkerchief?\n"+
		"Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona;\n"+
		"That which so often you did bid me steal.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Hast stol'n it from her?\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"No, 'faith; she let it drop by negligence.\n"+
		"And, to the advantage, I, being here, took't up.\n"+
		"Look, here it is.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"A good wench; give it me.\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"What will you do with 't, that you have been\n"+
		"so earnest\n"+
		"To have me filch it?\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"[Snatching it] Why, what's that to you?\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"If it be not for some purpose of import,\n"+
		"Give't me again: poor lady, she'll run mad\n"+
		"When she shall lack it.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Be not acknown on 't; I have use for it.\n"+
		"Go, leave me.\n"+
		"Exit EMILIA\n"+
		"I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin,\n"+
		"And let him find it. Trifles light as air\n"+
		"Are to the jealous confirmations strong\n"+
		"As proofs of holy writ: this may do something.\n"+
		"The Moor already changes with my poison:\n"+
		"Dangerous conceits are, in their natures, poisons.\n"+
		"Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,\n"+
		"But with a little act upon the blood.\n"+
		"Burn like the mines of Sulphur. I did say so:\n"+
		"Look, where he comes!\n"+
		"Re-enter OTHELLO\n"+
		"Not poppy, nor mandragora,\n"+
		"Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world,\n"+
		"Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep\n"+
		"Which thou owedst yesterday.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Ha! ha! false to me?\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Why, how now, general! no more of that.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Avaunt! be gone! thou hast set me on the rack:\n"+
		"I swear 'tis better to be much abused\n"+
		"Than but to know't a little.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"How now, my lord!\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust?\n"+
		"I saw't not, thought it not, it harm'd not me:\n"+
		"I slept the next night well, was free and merry;\n"+
		"I found not Cassio's kisses on her lips:\n"+
		"He that is robb'd, not wanting what is stol'n,\n"+
		"Let him not know't, and he's not robb'd at all.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"I am sorry to hear this.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"I had been happy, if the general camp,\n"+
		"Pioners and all, had tasted her sweet body,\n"+
		"So I had nothing known. O, now, for ever\n"+
		"Farewell the tranquil mind! farewell content!\n"+
		"Farewell the plumed troop, and the big wars,\n"+
		"That make ambition virtue! O, farewell!\n"+
		"Farewell the neighing steed, and the shrill trump,\n"+
		"The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife,\n"+
		"The royal banner, and all quality,\n"+
		"Pride, pomp and circumstance of glorious war!\n"+
		"And, O you mortal engines, whose rude throats\n"+
		"The immortal Jove's dead clamours counterfeit,\n"+
		"Farewell! Othello's occupation's gone!\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Is't possible, my lord?\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore,\n"+
		"Be sure of it; give me the ocular proof:\n"+
		"Or by the worth of man's eternal soul,\n"+
		"Thou hadst been better have been born a dog\n"+
		"Than answer my waked wrath!\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Is't come to this?\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Make me to see't; or, at the least, so prove it,\n"+
		"That the probation bear no hinge nor loop\n"+
		"To hang a doubt on; or woe upon thy life!\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"My noble lord,--\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"If thou dost slander her and torture me,\n"+
		"Never pray more; abandon all remorse;\n"+
		"On horror's head horrors accumulate;\n"+
		"Do deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amazed;\n"+
		"For nothing canst thou to damnation add\n"+
		"Greater than that.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"O grace! O heaven forgive me!\n"+
		"Are you a man? have you a soul or sense?\n"+
		"God be wi' you; take mine office. O wretched fool.\n"+
		"That livest to make thine honesty a vice!\n"+
		"O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world,\n"+
		"To be direct and honest is not safe.\n"+
		"I thank you for this profit; and from hence\n"+
		"I'll love no friend, sith love breeds such offence.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Nay, stay: thou shouldst be honest.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"I should be wise, for honesty's a fool\n"+
		"And loses that it works for.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"By the world,\n"+
		"I think my wife be honest and think she is not;\n"+
		"I think that thou art just and think thou art not.\n"+
		"I'll have some proof. Her name, that was as fresh\n"+
		"As Dian's visage, is now begrimed and black\n"+
		"As mine own face. If there be cords, or knives,\n"+
		"Poison, or fire, or suffocating streams,\n"+
		"I'll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion:\n"+
		"I do repent me that I put it to you.\n"+
		"You would be satisfied?\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Would! nay, I will.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"And may: but, how? how satisfied, my lord?\n"+
		"Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on--\n"+
		"Behold her topp'd?\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Death and damnation! O!\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"It were a tedious difficulty, I think,\n"+
		"To bring them to that prospect: damn them then,\n"+
		"If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster\n"+
		"More than their own! What then? how then?\n"+
		"What shall I say? Where's satisfaction?\n"+
		"It is impossible you should see this,\n"+
		"Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,\n"+
		"As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross\n"+
		"As ignorance made drunk. But yet, I say,\n"+
		"If imputation and strong circumstances,\n"+
		"Which lead directly to the door of truth,\n"+
		"Will give you satisfaction, you may have't.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Give me a living reason she's disloyal.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"I do not like the office:\n"+
		"But, sith I am enter'd in this cause so far,\n"+
		"Prick'd to't by foolish honesty and love,\n"+
		"I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately;\n"+
		"And, being troubled with a raging tooth,\n"+
		"I could not sleep.\n"+
		"There are a kind of men so loose of soul,\n"+
		"That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs:\n"+
		"One of this kind is Cassio:\n"+
		"In sleep I heard him say 'Sweet Desdemona,\n"+
		"Let us be wary, let us hide our loves;'\n"+
		"And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,\n"+
		"Cry 'O sweet creature!' and then kiss me hard,\n"+
		"As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots\n"+
		"That grew upon my lips: then laid his leg\n"+
		"Over my thigh, and sigh'd, and kiss'd; and then\n"+
		"Cried 'Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!'\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"O monstrous! monstrous!\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Nay, this was but his dream.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"But this denoted a foregone conclusion:\n"+
		"'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"And this may help to thicken other proofs\n"+
		"That do demonstrate thinly.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"I'll tear her all to pieces.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Nay, but be wise: yet we see nothing done;\n"+
		"She may be honest yet. Tell me but this,\n"+
		"Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief\n"+
		"Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand?\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"I know not that; but such a handkerchief--\n"+
		"I am sure it was your wife's--did I to-day\n"+
		"See Cassio wipe his beard with.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"If it be that--\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"If it be that, or any that was hers,\n"+
		"It speaks against her with the other proofs.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!\n"+
		"One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.\n"+
		"Now do I see 'tis true. Look here, Iago;\n"+
		"All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.\n"+
		"'Tis gone.\n"+
		"Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow cell!\n"+
		"Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne\n"+
		"To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,\n"+
		"For 'tis of aspics' tongues!\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Yet be content.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"O, blood, blood, blood!\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may change.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Never, Iago: Like to the Pontic sea,\n"+
		"Whose icy current and compulsive course\n"+
		"Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on\n"+
		"To the Propontic and the Hellespont,\n"+
		"Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace,\n"+
		"Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love,\n"+
		"Till that a capable and wide revenge\n"+
		"Swallow them up. Now, by yond marble heaven,\n"+
		"Kneels\n"+
		"In the due reverence of a sacred vow\n"+
		"I here engage my words.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Do not rise yet.\n"+
		"Kneels\n"+
		"Witness, you ever-burning lights above,\n"+
		"You elements that clip us round about,\n"+
		"Witness that here Iago doth give up\n"+
		"The execution of his wit, hands, heart,\n"+
		"To wrong'd Othello's service! Let him command,\n"+
		"And to obey shall be in me remorse,\n"+
		"What bloody business ever.\n"+
		"They rise\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"I greet thy love,\n"+
		"Not with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,\n"+
		"And will upon the instant put thee to't:\n"+
		"Within these three days let me hear thee say\n"+
		"That Cassio's not alive.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"My friend is dead; 'tis done at your request:\n"+
		"But let her live.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her!\n"+
		"Come, go with me apart; I will withdraw,\n"+
		"To furnish me with some swift means of death\n"+
		"For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"I am your own for ever.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV. Before the castle.\n"+
		"Enter DESDEMONA, EMILIA, and Clown\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"I dare not say he lies any where.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"Why, man?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"He's a soldier, and for one to say a soldier lies,\n"+
		"is stabbing.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"Go to: where lodges he?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"Can any thing be made of this?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a\n"+
		"lodging and say he lies here or he lies there, were\n"+
		"to lie in mine own throat.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"Can you inquire him out, and be edified by report?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"I will catechise the world for him; that is, make\n"+
		"questions, and by them answer.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"Seek him, bid him come hither: tell him I have\n"+
		"moved my lord on his behalf, and hope all will be well.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"To do this is within the compass of man's wit: and\n"+
		"therefore I will attempt the doing it.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"I know not, madam.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse\n"+
		"Full of crusadoes: and, but my noble Moor\n"+
		"Is true of mind and made of no such baseness\n"+
		"As jealous creatures are, it were enough\n"+
		"To put him to ill thinking.\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"Is he not jealous?\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"Who, he? I think the sun where he was born\n"+
		"Drew all such humours from him.\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"Look, where he comes.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"I will not leave him now till Cassio\n"+
		"Be call'd to him.\n"+
		"Enter OTHELLO\n"+
		"How is't with you, my lord\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Well, my good lady.\n"+
		"Aside\n"+
		"O, hardness to dissemble!--\n"+
		"How do you, Desdemona?\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"Well, my good lord.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Give me your hand: this hand is moist, my lady.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"It yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart:\n"+
		"Hot, hot, and moist: this hand of yours requires\n"+
		"A sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer,\n"+
		"Much castigation, exercise devout;\n"+
		"For here's a young and sweating devil here,\n"+
		"That commonly rebels. 'Tis a good hand,\n"+
		"A frank one.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"You may, indeed, say so;\n"+
		"For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"A liberal hand: the hearts of old gave hands;\n"+
		"But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"What promise, chuck?\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me;\n"+
		"Lend me thy handkerchief.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"Here, my lord.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"That which I gave you.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"I have it not about me.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Not?\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"No, indeed, my lord.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"That is a fault.\n"+
		"That handkerchief\n"+
		"Did an Egyptian to my mother give;\n"+
		"She was a charmer, and could almost read\n"+
		"The thoughts of people: she told her, while\n"+
		"she kept it,\n"+
		"'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father\n"+
		"Entirely to her love, but if she lost it\n"+
		"Or made gift of it, my father's eye\n"+
		"Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt\n"+
		"After new fancies: she, dying, gave it me;\n"+
		"And bid me, when my fate would have me wive,\n"+
		"To give it her. I did so: and take heed on't;\n"+
		"Make it a darling like your precious eye;\n"+
		"To lose't or give't away were such perdition\n"+
		"As nothing else could match.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"Is't possible?\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"'Tis true: there's magic in the web of it:\n"+
		"A sibyl, that had number'd in the world\n"+
		"The sun to course two hundred compasses,\n"+
		"In her prophetic fury sew'd the work;\n"+
		"The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk;\n"+
		"And it was dyed in mummy which the skilful\n"+
		"Conserved of maidens' hearts.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"Indeed! is't true?\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Most veritable; therefore look to't well.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"Then would to God that I had never seen't!\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Ha! wherefore?\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"Why do you speak so startingly and rash?\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Is't lost? is't gone? speak, is it out\n"+
		"o' the way?\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"Heaven bless us!\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Say you?\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"It is not lost; but what an if it were?\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"How!\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"I say, it is not lost.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Fetch't, let me see't.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now.\n"+
		"This is a trick to put me from my suit:\n"+
		"Pray you, let Cassio be received again.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Fetch me the handkerchief: my mind misgives.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"Come, come;\n"+
		"You'll never meet a more sufficient man.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"The handkerchief!\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"I pray, talk me of Cassio.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"The handkerchief!\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"A man that all his time\n"+
		"Hath founded his good fortunes on your love,\n"+
		"Shared dangers with you,--\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"The handkerchief!\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"In sooth, you are to blame.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Away!\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"Is not this man jealous?\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"I ne'er saw this before.\n"+
		"Sure, there's some wonder in this handkerchief:\n"+
		"I am most unhappy in the loss of it.\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"'Tis not a year or two shows us a man:\n"+
		"They are all but stomachs, and we all but food;\n"+
		"To eat us hungerly, and when they are full,\n"+
		"They belch us. Look you, Cassio and my husband!\n"+
		"Enter CASSIO and IAGO\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"There is no other way; 'tis she must do't:\n"+
		"And, lo, the happiness! go, and importune her.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"How now, good Cassio! what's the news with you?\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"Madam, my former suit: I do beseech you\n"+
		"That by your virtuous means I may again\n"+
		"Exist, and be a member of his love\n"+
		"Whom I with all the office of my heart\n"+
		"Entirely honour: I would not be delay'd.\n"+
		"If my offence be of such mortal kind\n"+
		"That nor my service past, nor present sorrows,\n"+
		"Nor purposed merit in futurity,\n"+
		"Can ransom me into his love again,\n"+
		"But to know so must be my benefit;\n"+
		"So shall I clothe me in a forced content,\n"+
		"And shut myself up in some other course,\n"+
		"To fortune's alms.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio!\n"+
		"My advocation is not now in tune;\n"+
		"My lord is not my lord; nor should I know him,\n"+
		"Were he in favour as in humour alter'd.\n"+
		"So help me every spirit sanctified,\n"+
		"As I have spoken for you all my best\n"+
		"And stood within the blank of his displeasure\n"+
		"For my free speech! you must awhile be patient:\n"+
		"What I can do I will; and more I will\n"+
		"Than for myself I dare: let that suffice you.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Is my lord angry?\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"He went hence but now,\n"+
		"And certainly in strange unquietness.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon,\n"+
		"When it hath blown his ranks into the air,\n"+
		"And, like the devil, from his very arm\n"+
		"Puff'd his own brother:--and can he be angry?\n"+
		"Something of moment then: I will go meet him:\n"+
		"There's matter in't indeed, if he be angry.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"I prithee, do so.\n"+
		"Exit IAGO\n"+
		"Something, sure, of state,\n"+
		"Either from Venice, or some unhatch'd practise\n"+
		"Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,\n"+
		"Hath puddled his clear spirit: and in such cases\n"+
		"Men's natures wrangle with inferior things,\n"+
		"Though great ones are their object. 'Tis even so;\n"+
		"For let our finger ache, and it indues\n"+
		"Our other healthful members even to that sense\n"+
		"Of pain: nay, we must think men are not gods,\n"+
		"Nor of them look for such observances\n"+
		"As fit the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,\n"+
		"I was, unhandsome warrior as I am,\n"+
		"Arraigning his unkindness with my soul;\n"+
		"But now I find I had suborn'd the witness,\n"+
		"And he's indicted falsely.\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"Pray heaven it be state-matters, as you think,\n"+
		"And no conception nor no jealous toy\n"+
		"Concerning you.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"Alas the day! I never gave him cause.\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"But jealous souls will not be answer'd so;\n"+
		"They are not ever jealous for the cause,\n"+
		"But jealous for they are jealous: 'tis a monster\n"+
		"Begot upon itself, born on itself.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind!\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"Lady, amen.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"I will go seek him. Cassio, walk hereabout:\n"+
		"If I do find him fit, I'll move your suit\n"+
		"And seek to effect it to my uttermost.\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"I humbly thank your ladyship.\n"+
		"Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA\n"+
		"Enter BIANCA\n"+
		"BIANCA\n"+
		"Save you, friend Cassio!\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"What make you from home?\n"+
		"How is it with you, my most fair Bianca?\n"+
		"I' faith, sweet love, I was coming to your house.\n"+
		"BIANCA\n"+
		"And I was going to your lodging, Cassio.\n"+
		"What, keep a week away? seven days and nights?\n"+
		"Eight score eight hours? and lovers' absent hours,\n"+
		"More tedious than the dial eight score times?\n"+
		"O weary reckoning!\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"Pardon me, Bianca:\n"+
		"I have this while with leaden thoughts been press'd:\n"+
		"But I shall, in a more continuate time,\n"+
		"Strike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca,\n"+
		"Giving her DESDEMONA's handkerchief\n"+
		"Take me this work out.\n"+
		"BIANCA\n"+
		"O Cassio, whence came this?\n"+
		"This is some token from a newer friend:\n"+
		"To the felt absence now I feel a cause:\n"+
		"Is't come to this? Well, well.\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"Go to, woman!\n"+
		"Throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth,\n"+
		"From whence you have them. You are jealous now\n"+
		"That this is from some mistress, some remembrance:\n"+
		"No, in good troth, Bianca.\n"+
		"BIANCA\n"+
		"Why, whose is it?\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"I know not, sweet: I found it in my chamber.\n"+
		"I like the work well: ere it be demanded--\n"+
		"As like enough it will--I'ld have it copied:\n"+
		"Take it, and do't; and leave me for this time.\n"+
		"BIANCA\n"+
		"Leave you! wherefore?\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"I do attend here on the general;\n"+
		"And think it no addition, nor my wish,\n"+
		"To have him see me woman'd.\n"+
		"BIANCA\n"+
		"Why, I pray you?\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"Not that I love you not.\n"+
		"BIANCA\n"+
		"But that you do not love me.\n"+
		"I pray you, bring me on the way a little,\n"+
		"And say if I shall see you soon at night.\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"'Tis but a little way that I can bring you;\n"+
		"For I attend here: but I'll see you soon.\n"+
		"BIANCA\n"+
		"'Tis very good; I must be circumstanced.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT IV\n"+
		"SCENE I. Cyprus. Before the castle.\n"+
		"Enter OTHELLO and IAGO\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Will you think so?\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Think so, Iago!\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"What,\n"+
		"To kiss in private?\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"An unauthorized kiss.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Or to be naked with her friend in bed\n"+
		"An hour or more, not meaning any harm?\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm!\n"+
		"It is hypocrisy against the devil:\n"+
		"They that mean virtuously, and yet do so,\n"+
		"The devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt heaven.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"So they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip:\n"+
		"But if I give my wife a handkerchief,--\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"What then?\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Why, then, 'tis hers, my lord; and, being hers,\n"+
		"She may, I think, bestow't on any man.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"She is protectress of her honour too:\n"+
		"May she give that?\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Her honour is an essence that's not seen;\n"+
		"They have it very oft that have it not:\n"+
		"But, for the handkerchief,--\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.\n"+
		"Thou said'st, it comes o'er my memory,\n"+
		"As doth the raven o'er the infected house,\n"+
		"Boding to all--he had my handkerchief.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Ay, what of that?\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"That's not so good now.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"What,\n"+
		"If I had said I had seen him do you wrong?\n"+
		"Or heard him say,--as knaves be such abroad,\n"+
		"Who having, by their own importunate suit,\n"+
		"Or voluntary dotage of some mistress,\n"+
		"Convinced or supplied them, cannot choose\n"+
		"But they must blab--\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Hath he said any thing?\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"He hath, my lord; but be you well assured,\n"+
		"No more than he'll unswear.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"What hath he said?\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"'Faith, that he did--I know not what he did.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"What? what?\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Lie--\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"With her?\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"With her, on her; what you will.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Lie with her! lie on her! We say lie on her, when\n"+
		"they belie her. Lie with her! that's fulsome.\n"+
		"--Handkerchief--confessions--handkerchief!--To\n"+
		"confess, and be hanged for his labour;--first, to be\n"+
		"hanged, and then to confess.--I tremble at it.\n"+
		"Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing\n"+
		"passion without some instruction. It is not words\n"+
		"that shake me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips.\n"+
		"--Is't possible?--Confess--handkerchief!--O devil!--\n"+
		"Falls in a trance\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Work on,\n"+
		"My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught;\n"+
		"And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,\n"+
		"All guiltless, meet reproach. What, ho! my lord!\n"+
		"My lord, I say! Othello!\n"+
		"Enter CASSIO\n"+
		"How now, Cassio!\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"What's the matter?\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"My lord is fall'n into an epilepsy:\n"+
		"This is his second fit; he had one yesterday.\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"Rub him about the temples.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"No, forbear;\n"+
		"The lethargy must have his quiet course:\n"+
		"If not, he foams at mouth and by and by\n"+
		"Breaks out to savage madness. Look he stirs:\n"+
		"Do you withdraw yourself a little while,\n"+
		"He will recover straight: when he is gone,\n"+
		"I would on great occasion speak with you.\n"+
		"Exit CASSIO\n"+
		"How is it, general? have you not hurt your head?\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Dost thou mock me?\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"I mock you! no, by heaven.\n"+
		"Would you would bear your fortune like a man!\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"A horned man's a monster and a beast.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"There's many a beast then in a populous city,\n"+
		"And many a civil monster.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Did he confess it?\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Good sir, be a man;\n"+
		"Think every bearded fellow that's but yoked\n"+
		"May draw with you: there's millions now alive\n"+
		"That nightly lie in those unproper beds\n"+
		"Which they dare swear peculiar: your case is better.\n"+
		"O, 'tis the spite of hell, the fiend's arch-mock,\n"+
		"To lip a wanton in a secure couch,\n"+
		"And to suppose her chaste! No, let me know;\n"+
		"And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"O, thou art wise; 'tis certain.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Stand you awhile apart;\n"+
		"Confine yourself but in a patient list.\n"+
		"Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief--\n"+
		"A passion most unsuiting such a man--\n"+
		"Cassio came hither: I shifted him away,\n"+
		"And laid good 'scuse upon your ecstasy,\n"+
		"Bade him anon return and here speak with me;\n"+
		"The which he promised. Do but encave yourself,\n"+
		"And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns,\n"+
		"That dwell in every region of his face;\n"+
		"For I will make him tell the tale anew,\n"+
		"Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when\n"+
		"He hath, and is again to cope your wife:\n"+
		"I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience;\n"+
		"Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen,\n"+
		"And nothing of a man.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Dost thou hear, Iago?\n"+
		"I will be found most cunning in my patience;\n"+
		"But--dost thou hear?--most bloody.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"That's not amiss;\n"+
		"But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?\n"+
		"OTHELLO retires\n"+
		"Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,\n"+
		"A housewife that by selling her desires\n"+
		"Buys herself bread and clothes: it is a creature\n"+
		"That dotes on Cassio; as 'tis the strumpet's plague\n"+
		"To beguile many and be beguiled by one:\n"+
		"He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain\n"+
		"From the excess of laughter. Here he comes:\n"+
		"Re-enter CASSIO\n"+
		"As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad;\n"+
		"And his unbookish jealousy must construe\n"+
		"Poor Cassio's smiles, gestures and light behavior,\n"+
		"Quite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant?\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"The worser that you give me the addition\n"+
		"Whose want even kills me.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on't.\n"+
		"Speaking lower\n"+
		"Now, if this suit lay in Bianco's power,\n"+
		"How quickly should you speed!\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"Alas, poor caitiff!\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Look, how he laughs already!\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"I never knew woman love man so.\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"Alas, poor rogue! I think, i' faith, she loves me.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Now he denies it faintly, and laughs it out.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Do you hear, Cassio?\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Now he importunes him\n"+
		"To tell it o'er: go to; well said, well said.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"She gives it out that you shall marry hey:\n"+
		"Do you intend it?\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"Ha, ha, ha!\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Do you triumph, Roman? do you triumph?\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"I marry her! what? a customer! Prithee, bear some\n"+
		"charity to my wit: do not think it so unwholesome.\n"+
		"Ha, ha, ha!\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"So, so, so, so: they laugh that win.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"'Faith, the cry goes that you shall marry her.\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"Prithee, say true.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"I am a very villain else.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Have you scored me? Well.\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"This is the monkey's own giving out: she is\n"+
		"persuaded I will marry her, out of her own love and\n"+
		"flattery, not out of my promise.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Iago beckons me; now he begins the story.\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"She was here even now; she haunts me in every place.\n"+
		"I was the other day talking on the sea-bank with\n"+
		"certain Venetians; and thither comes the bauble,\n"+
		"and, by this hand, she falls me thus about my neck--\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Crying 'O dear Cassio!' as it were: his gesture\n"+
		"imports it.\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"So hangs, and lolls, and weeps upon me; so hales,\n"+
		"and pulls me: ha, ha, ha!\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O,\n"+
		"I see that nose of yours, but not that dog I shall\n"+
		"throw it to.\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"Well, I must leave her company.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Before me! look, where she comes.\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"'Tis such another fitchew! marry a perfumed one.\n"+
		"Enter BIANCA\n"+
		"What do you mean by this haunting of me?\n"+
		"BIANCA\n"+
		"Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you\n"+
		"mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now?\n"+
		"I was a fine fool to take it. I must take out the\n"+
		"work?--A likely piece of work, that you should find\n"+
		"it in your chamber, and not know who left it there!\n"+
		"This is some minx's token, and I must take out the\n"+
		"work? There; give it your hobby-horse: wheresoever\n"+
		"you had it, I'll take out no work on't.\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"How now, my sweet Bianca! how now! how now!\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!\n"+
		"BIANCA\n"+
		"An you'll come to supper to-night, you may; an you\n"+
		"will not, come when you are next prepared for.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"After her, after her.\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"'Faith, I must; she'll rail in the street else.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Will you sup there?\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"'Faith, I intend so.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Well, I may chance to see you; for I would very fain\n"+
		"speak with you.\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"Prithee, come; will you?\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Go to; say no more.\n"+
		"Exit CASSIO\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"[Advancing] How shall I murder him, Iago?\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"O Iago!\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"And did you see the handkerchief?\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Was that mine?\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Yours by this hand: and to see how he prizes the\n"+
		"foolish woman your wife! she gave it him, and he\n"+
		"hath given it his whore.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"I would have him nine years a-killing.\n"+
		"A fine woman! a fair woman! a sweet woman!\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Nay, you must forget that.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Ay, let her rot, and perish, and be damned to-night;\n"+
		"for she shall not live: no, my heart is turned to\n"+
		"stone; I strike it, and it hurts my hand. O, the\n"+
		"world hath not a sweeter creature: she might lie by\n"+
		"an emperor's side and command him tasks.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Nay, that's not your way.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Hang her! I do but say what she is: so delicate\n"+
		"with her needle: an admirable musician: O! she\n"+
		"will sing the savageness out of a bear: of so high\n"+
		"and plenteous wit and invention:--\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"She's the worse for all this.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"O, a thousand thousand times: and then, of so\n"+
		"gentle a condition!\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Ay, too gentle.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Nay, that's certain: but yet the pity of it, Iago!\n"+
		"O Iago, the pity of it, Iago!\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her\n"+
		"patent to offend; for, if it touch not you, it comes\n"+
		"near nobody.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+

		"What trumpet is that same?\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Something from Venice, sure. 'Tis Lodovico\n"+
		"Come from the duke: and, see, your wife is with him.\n"+

		"Save you, worthy general!\n"+

		"The duke and senators of Venice greet you.\n"+
		"Gives him a letter\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"I kiss the instrument of their pleasures.\n"+
		"Opens the letter, and reads\n"+

		"And what's the news, good cousin Lodovico?\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"I am very glad to see you, signior\n"+
		"Welcome to Cyprus.\n"+

		"I thank you. How does Lieutenant Cassio?\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Lives, sir.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"Cousin, there's fall'n between him and my lord\n"+
		"An unkind breach: but you shall make all well.\n"+

		"My lord?\n"+

		"[Reads] 'This fail you not to do, as you will--'\n"+
		"LODOVICO\n"+
		"He did not call; he's busy in the paper.\n"+
		"Is there division 'twixt my lord and Cassio?\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"A most unhappy one: I would do much\n"+
		"To atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Fire and brimstone!\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"My lord?\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Are you wise?\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"What, is he angry?\n"+
		"LODOVICO\n"+
		"May be the letter moved him;\n"+

		"My lord, this would not be believed in Venice,\n"+

		"Make her amends; she weeps.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"O devil, devil!\n"+
		"If that the earth could teem with woman's tears,\n"+

		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"What would you with her, sir?\n"+
		"LODOVICO\n"+
		"Who, I, my lord?\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Ay; you did wish that I would make her turn:\n"+
		"Sir, she can turn, and turn, and yet go on,\n"+
		"And turn again; and she can weep, sir, weep;\n"+
		"And she's obedient, as you say, obedient,\n"+
		"Very obedient. Proceed you in your tears.\n"+
		"Concerning this, sir,--O well-painted passion!--\n"+
		"I am commanded home. Get you away;\n"+

		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"You have seen nothing then?\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together.\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+

		"What, did they never whisper?\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"Never, my lord.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+

		"Never.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"Never, my lord.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"That's strange.\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest,\n"+
		"Lay down my soul at stake: if you think other,\n"+
		"Remove your thought; it doth abuse your bosom.\n"+
		"If any wretch have put this in your head,\n"+
		"Let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse!\n"+
		"For, if she be not honest, chaste, and true,\n"+
		"There's no man happy; the purest of their wives\n"+
		"Is foul as slander.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Bid her come hither: go.\n"+
		"Exit EMILIA\n"+
		"She says enough; yet she's a simple bawd\n"+
		"That cannot say as much. This is a subtle whore,\n"+
		"A closet lock and key of villanous secrets\n"+
		"And yet she'll kneel and pray; I have seen her do't.\n"+
		"Enter DESDEMONA with EMILIA\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"My lord, what is your will?\n"+

		"What is your pleasure?\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Let me see your eyes;\n"+

		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"[To EMILIA] Some of your function, mistress;\n"+

		"Exit EMILIA\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?\n"+
		"I understand a fury in your words.\n"+
		"But not the words.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Why, what art thou?\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"Your wife, my lord; your true\n"+
		"And loyal wife.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Come, swear it, damn thyself\n"+
		"Lest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselves\n"+
		"Should fear to seize thee: therefore be double damn'd:\n"+
		"Swear thou art honest.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"Heaven doth truly know it.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"To whom, my lord? with whom? how am I false?\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"O Desdemona! away! away! away!\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+

		"If haply you my father do suspect\n"+
		"An instrument of this your calling back,\n"+
		"Lay not your blame on me: If you have lost him,\n"+
		"Why, I have lost him too.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Had it pleased heaven\n"+
		"To try me with affliction; had they rain'd\n"+
		"All kinds of sores and shames on my bare head.\n"+
		"Steep'd me in poverty to the very lips,\n"+
		"Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes,\n"+
		"I should have found in some place of my soul\n"+
		"A drop of patience: but, alas, to make me\n"+
		"A fixed figure for the time of scorn\n"+
		"To point his slow unmoving finger at!\n"+
		"Yet could I bear that too; well, very well:\n"+
		"But there, where I have garner'd up my heart,\n"+
		"Where either I must live, or bear no life;\n"+
		"The fountain from the which my current runs,\n"+
		"Or else dries up; to be discarded thence!\n"+
		"Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads\n"+
		"To knot and gender in! Turn thy complexion there,\n"+
		"Patience, thou young and rose-lipp'd cherubin,--\n"+
		"Ay, there, look grim as hell!\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"O, ay; as summer flies are in the shambles,\n"+
		"That quicken even with blowing. O thou weed,\n"+
		"Who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet\n"+
		"That the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst\n"+
		"ne'er been born!\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed?\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Was this fair paper, this most goodly book,\n"+
		"Made to write 'whore' upon? What committed!\n"+
		"Committed! O thou public commoner!\n"+
		"I should make very forges of my cheeks,\n"+
		"That would to cinders burn up modesty,\n"+
		"Did I but speak thy deeds. What committed!\n"+
		"Heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks,\n"+
		"The bawdy wind that kisses all it meets\n"+
		"Is hush'd within the hollow mine of earth,\n"+
		"And will not hear it. What committed!\n"+
		"Impudent strumpet!\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"By heaven, you do me wrong.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Are you not a strumpet?\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"No, as I am a Christian:\n"+
		"If to preserve this vessel for my lord\n"+
		"From any other foul unlawful touch\n"+
		"Be not to be a strumpet, I am none.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"What, not a whore?\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"No, as I shall be saved.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Is't possible?\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"O, heaven forgive us!\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"I cry you mercy, then:\n"+
		"I took you for that cunning whore of Venice\n"+
		"That married with Othello.\n"+
		"Raising his voice\n"+
		"You, mistress,\n"+
		"That have the office opposite to Saint Peter,\n"+

		"Why, with my lord, madam.\n"+

		"He that is yours, sweet lady.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"I have none: do not talk to me, Emilia;\n"+
		"I cannot weep; nor answer have I none,\n"+
		"But what should go by water. Prithee, tonight\n"+
		"Lay on my bed my wedding sheets: remember;\n"+
		"And call thy husband hither.\n"+

		"Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her.\n"+

		"What name, fair lady?\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"Such as she says my lord did say I was.\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"He call'd her whore: a beggar in his drink\n"+
		"Could not have laid such terms upon his callat.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Why did he so?\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"I do not know; I am sure I am none such.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Do not weep, do not weep. Alas the day!\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"Hath she forsook so many noble matches,\n"+
		"Her father and her country and her friends,\n"+
		"To be call'd whore? would it not make one weep?\n"+

		"It is my wretched fortune.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Beshrew him for't!\n"+
		"How comes this trick upon him?\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"Nay, heaven doth know.\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"I will be hang'd, if some eternal villain,\n"+
		"Some busy and insinuating rogue,\n"+
		"Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office,\n"+
		"Have not devised this slander; I'll be hang'd else.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Fie, there is no such man; it is impossible.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+
		"If any such there be, heaven pardon him!\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"A halter pardon him! and hell gnaw his bones!\n"+
		"Why should he call her whore? who keeps her company?\n"+
		"What place? what time? what form? what likelihood?\n"+
		"The Moor's abused by some most villanous knave,\n"+
		"Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow.\n"+

		"And put in every honest hand a whip\n"+
		"To lash the rascals naked through the world\n"+
		"Even from the east to the west!\n"+

		"Speak within door.\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"O, fie upon them! Some such squire he was\n"+
		"That turn'd your wit the seamy side without,\n"+

		"You are a fool; go to.\n"+

		"O good Iago,\n"+
		"What shall I do to win my lord again?\n"+
		"Good friend, go to him; for, by this light of heaven,\n"+
		"I know not how I lost him. Here I kneel:\n"+
		"If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love,\n"+
		"Either in discourse of thought or actual deed,\n"+
		"Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense,\n"+
		"Delighted them in any other form;\n"+
		"Or that I do not yet, and ever did.\n"+
		"And ever will--though he do shake me off\n"+
		"To beggarly divorcement--love him dearly,\n"+
		"Comfort forswear me! Unkindness may do much;\n"+
		"And his unkindness may defeat my life,\n"+
		"But never taint my love. I cannot say 'whore:'\n"+

		"To do the act that might the addition earn\n"+
		"Not the world's mass of vanity could make me.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"I pray you, be content; 'tis but his humour:\n"+

		"Enter RODERIGO\n"+
		"How now, Roderigo!\n"+
		"RODERIGO\n"+
		"I do not find that thou dealest justly with me.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"What in the contrary?\n"+
		"RODERIGO\n"+
		"Every day thou daffest me with some device, Iago;\n"+
		"and rather, as it seems to me now, keepest from me\n"+
		"all conveniency than suppliest me with the least\n"+
		"advantage of hope. I will indeed no longer endure\n"+
		"it, nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what\n"+
		"already I have foolishly suffered.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Will you hear me, Roderigo?\n"+
		"RODERIGO\n"+
		"'Faith, I have heard too much, for your words and\n"+
		"performances are no kin together.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"You charge me most unjustly.\n"+
		"RODERIGO\n"+
		"With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out of\n"+
		"my means. The jewels you have had from me to\n"+
		"deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted a\n"+
		"votarist: you have told me she hath received them\n"+
		"and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden\n"+
		"respect and acquaintance, but I find none.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Well; go to; very well.\n"+
		"RODERIGO\n"+
		"Very well! go to! I cannot go to, man; nor 'tis\n"+
		"not very well: nay, I think it is scurvy, and begin\n"+
		"to find myself fobbed in it.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Very well.\n"+
		"RODERIGO\n"+
		"I tell you 'tis not very well. I will make myself\n"+
		"known to Desdemona: if she will return me my\n"+
		"jewels, I will give over my suit and repent my\n"+
		"unlawful solicitation; if not, assure yourself I\n"+
		"will seek satisfaction of you.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"You have said now.\n"+
		"RODERIGO\n"+
		"Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Why, now I see there's mettle in thee, and even from\n"+
		"this instant to build on thee a better opinion than\n"+
		"ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo: thou hast\n"+
		"taken against me a most just exception; but yet, I\n"+
		"protest, I have dealt most directly in thy affair.\n"+
		"RODERIGO\n"+
		"It hath not appeared.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your\n"+
		"suspicion is not without wit and judgment. But,\n"+
		"Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which I\n"+
		"have greater reason to believe now than ever, I mean\n"+
		"purpose, courage and valour, this night show it: if\n"+
		"thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona,\n"+
		"take me from this world with treachery and devise\n"+
		"engines for my life.\n"+
		"RODERIGO\n"+
		"Well, what is it? is it within reason and compass?\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice\n"+
		"to depute Cassio in Othello's place.\n"+
		"RODERIGO\n"+
		"Is that true? why, then Othello and Desdemona\n"+
		"return again to Venice.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"O, no; he goes into Mauritania and takes away with\n"+
		"him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be\n"+
		"lingered here by some accident: wherein none can be\n"+
		"so determinate as the removing of Cassio.\n"+
		"RODERIGO\n"+
		"How do you mean, removing of him?\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place;\n"+
		"knocking out his brains.\n"+
		"RODERIGO\n"+
		"And that you would have me to do?\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right.\n"+
		"He sups to-night with a harlotry, and thither will I\n"+
		"go to him: he knows not yet of his horrorable\n"+
		"fortune. If you will watch his going thence, which\n"+
		"I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one,\n"+
		"you may take him at your pleasure: I will be near\n"+
		"to second your attempt, and he shall fall between\n"+
		"us. Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with\n"+
		"me; I will show you such a necessity in his death\n"+
		"that you shall think yourself bound to put it on\n"+
		"him. It is now high suppertime, and the night grows\n"+
		"to waste: about it.\n"+
		"RODERIGO\n"+
		"I will hear further reason for this.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"And you shall be satisfied.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+

		"How goes it now? he looks gentler than he did.\n"+
		"DESDEMONA\n"+

		"EMILIA\n"+
		"Dismiss me!\n"+

		"It was his bidding: therefore, good Emilia,.\n"+

		"And she died singing it: that song to-night\n"+

		"No, unpin me here.\n"+

		"Ay, but not yet to die.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Yes, presently:\n"+

		"My husband!\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Thy husband.\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"That she was false to wedlock?\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Ay, with Cassio. Nay, had she been true,\n"+
		"If heaven would make me such another world\n"+
		"Of one entire and Perfect chrysolite,\n"+
		"I'ld not have sold her for it.\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"My husband!\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Ay, 'twas he that told me first:\n"+
		"An honest man he is, and hates the slime\n"+
		"That sticks on filthy deeds.\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"My husband!\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"What needs this iteration, woman? I say thy husband.\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"O mistress, villany hath made mocks with love,\n"+
		"My husband say that she was false!\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"He, woman;\n"+
		"I say thy husband: dost understand the word?\n"+
		"My friend, thy husband, honest, honest Iago.\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"If he say so, may his pernicious soul\n"+
		"Rot half a grain a day! he lies to the heart:\n"+
		"She was too fond of her most filthy bargain.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Ha!\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"Do thy worst:\n"+
		"This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven\n"+
		"Than thou wast worthy her.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Peace, you were best.\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"Thou hast not half that power to do me harm\n"+
		"As I have to be hurt. O gull! O dolt!\n"+
		"As ignorant as dirt! thou hast done a deed--\n"+
		"I care not for thy sword; I'll make thee known,\n"+
		"Though I lost twenty lives.--Help! help, ho! help!\n"+
		"The Moor hath kill'd my mistress! Murder! murder!\n"+
		"Enter MONTANO, GRATIANO, IAGO, and others\n"+
		"MONTANO\n"+
		"What is the matter? How now, general!\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"O, are you come, Iago? you have done well,\n"+
		"That men must lay their murders on your neck.\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"What is the matter?\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"Disprove this villain, if thou be'st a man:\n"+
		"He says thou told'st him that his wife was false:\n"+
		"I know thou didst not, thou'rt not such a villain:\n"+
		"Speak, for my heart is full.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"I told him what I thought, and told no more\n"+
		"Than what he found himself was apt and true.\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"But did you ever tell him she was false?\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"I did.\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"You told a lie, an odious, damned lie;\n"+
		"Upon my soul, a lie, a wicked lie.\n"+
		"She false with Cassio!--did you say with Cassio?\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"With Cassio, mistress. Go to, charm your tongue.\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"I will not charm my tongue; I am bound to speak:\n"+
		"My mistress here lies murder'd in her bed,--\n"+
		"All\n"+
		"O heavens forfend!\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"And your reports have set the murder on.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Nay, stare not, masters: it is true, indeed.\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"'Tis a strange truth.\n"+
		"MONTANO\n"+
		"O monstrous act!\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"Villany, villany, villany!\n"+
		"I think upon't, I think: I smell't: O villany!--\n"+
		"I thought so then:--I'll kill myself for grief:--\n"+
		"O villany, villany!\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"What, are you mad? I charge you, get you home.\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"Good gentlemen, let me have leave to speak:\n"+
		"'Tis proper I obey him, but not now.\n"+
		"Perchance, Iago, I will ne'er go home.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"O! O! O!\n"+
		"He falls on the bed\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"Nay, lay thee down and roar;\n"+
		"For thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocent\n"+
		"That e'er did lift up eye.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"[Rising] O, she was foul!\n"+
		"I scarce did know you, uncle: there lies your niece,\n"+
		"Whose breath, indeed, these hands have newly stopp'd:\n"+
		"I know this act shows horrible and grim.\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"Poor Desdemona! I am glad thy father's dead:\n"+
		"Thy match was mortal to him, and pure grief\n"+
		"Shore his old thread in twain: did he live now,\n"+
		"This sight would make him do a desperate turn,\n"+
		"Yea, curse his better angel from his side,\n"+
		"And fall to reprobation.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"'Tis pitiful; but yet Iago knows\n"+
		"That she with Cassio hath the act of shame\n"+
		"A thousand times committed; Cassio confess'd it:\n"+
		"And she did gratify his amorous works\n"+
		"With that recognizance and pledge of love\n"+
		"Which I first gave her; I saw it in his hand:\n"+
		"It was a handkerchief, an antique token\n"+
		"My father gave my mother.\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"O heaven! O heavenly powers!\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Come, hold your peace.\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"'Twill out, 'twill out: I peace!\n"+
		"No, I will speak as liberal as the north:\n"+
		"Let heaven and men and devils, let them all,\n"+
		"All, all, cry shame against me, yet I'll speak.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Be wise, and get you home.\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"I will not.\n"+
		"IAGO offers to stab EMILIA\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"Fie!\n"+
		"Your sword upon a woman?\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"O thou dull Moor! that handkerchief thou speak'st of\n"+
		"I found by fortune and did give my husband;\n"+
		"For often, with a solemn earnestness,\n"+
		"More than indeed belong'd to such a trifle,\n"+
		"He begg'd of me to steal it.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Villanous whore!\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"She give it Cassio! no, alas! I found it,\n"+
		"And I did give't my husband.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Filth, thou liest!\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"By heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen.\n"+
		"O murderous coxcomb! what should such a fool\n"+
		"Do with so good a woman?\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Are there no stones in heaven\n"+
		"But what serve for the thunder?--Precious villain!\n"+
		"He runs at IAGO IAGO, from behind, stabs EMILIA, and exit\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"The woman falls; sure, he hath kill'd his wife.\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"Ay, ay: O, lay me by my mistress' side.\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"He's gone, but his wife's kill'd.\n"+
		"MONTANO\n"+
		"'Tis a notorious villain. Take you this weapon,\n"+
		"Which I have here recover'd from the Moor:\n"+
		"Come, guard the door without; let him not pass,\n"+
		"But kill him rather. I'll after that same villain,\n"+
		"For 'tis a damned slave.\n"+
		"Exeunt MONTANO and GRATIANO\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"I am not valiant neither,\n"+
		"But ever puny whipster gets my sword:\n"+
		"But why should honour outlive honesty?\n"+
		"Let it go all.\n"+
		"EMILIA\n"+
		"What did thy song bode, lady?\n"+
		"Hark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan.\n"+
		"And die in music.\n"+
		"Singing\n"+
		"Willow, willow, willow,--\n"+
		"Moor, she was chaste; she loved thee, cruel Moor;\n"+
		"So come my soul to bliss, as I speak true;\n"+
		"So speaking as I think, I die, I die.\n"+
		"Dies\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"I have another weapon in this chamber;\n"+
		"It is a sword of Spain, the ice-brook's temper:--\n"+
		"O, here it is. Uncle, I must come forth.\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"[Within] If thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear:\n"+
		"Thou hast no weapon, and perforce must suffer.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Look in upon me then and speak with me,\n"+
		"Or, naked as I am, I will assault thee.\n"+
		"Re-enter GRATIANO\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"What is the matter?\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Behold, I have a weapon;\n"+
		"A better never did itself sustain\n"+
		"Upon a soldier's thigh: I have seen the day,\n"+
		"That, with this little arm and this good sword,\n"+
		"I have made my way through more impediments\n"+
		"Than twenty times your stop: but, O vain boast!\n"+
		"Who can control his fate? 'tis not so now.\n"+
		"Be not afraid, though you do see me weapon'd;\n"+
		"Here is my journey's end, here is my butt,\n"+
		"And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.\n"+
		"Do you go back dismay'd? 'tis a lost fear;\n"+
		"Man but a rush against Othello's breast,\n"+
		"And he retires. Where should Othello go?\n"+
		"Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starr'd wench!\n"+
		"Pale as thy smock! when we shall meet at compt,\n"+
		"This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,\n"+
		"And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl!\n"+
		"Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!\n"+
		"Whip me, ye devils,\n"+
		"From the possession of this heavenly sight!\n"+
		"Blow me about in winds! roast me in sulphur!\n"+
		"Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!\n"+
		"O Desdemona! Desdemona! dead!\n"+
		"Oh! Oh! Oh!\n"+
		"Enter LODOVICO. MONTANO, CASSIO carried in a chair, and Officers with IAGO, prisoner\n"+
		"LODOVICO\n"+
		"Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"That's he that was Othello: here I am.\n"+
		"LODOVICO\n"+
		"Where is that viper? bring the villain forth.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"I look down towards his feet; but that's a fable.\n"+
		"If that thou best a devil, I cannot kill thee.\n"+
		"Wounds IAGO\n"+
		"LODOVICO\n"+
		"Wrench his sword from him.\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"I bleed, sir; but not kill'd.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"I am not sorry neither: I'ld have thee live;\n"+
		"For, in my sense, 'tis happiness to die.\n"+
		"LODOVICO\n"+
		"O thou Othello, thou wert once so good,\n"+
		"Fall'n in the practise of a damned slave,\n"+
		"What shall be said to thee?\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Why, any thing:\n"+
		"An honourable murderer, if you will;\n"+
		"For nought I did in hate, but all in honour.\n"+
		"LODOVICO\n"+
		"This wretch hath part confess'd his villany:\n"+
		"Did you and he consent in Cassio's death?\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Ay.\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"Dear general, I never gave you cause.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.\n"+
		"Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil\n"+
		"Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body?\n"+
		"IAGO\n"+
		"Demand me nothing: what you know, you know:\n"+
		"From this time forth I never will speak word.\n"+
		"LODOVICO\n"+
		"What, not to pray?\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"Torments will ope your lips.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Well, thou dost best.\n"+
		"LODOVICO\n"+
		"Sir, you shall understand what hath befall'n,\n"+
		"Which, as I think, you know not. Here is a letter\n"+
		"Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo;\n"+
		"And here another: the one of them imports\n"+
		"The death of Cassio to be undertook\n"+
		"By Roderigo.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"O villain!\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"Most heathenish and most gross!\n"+
		"LODOVICO\n"+
		"Now here's another discontented paper,\n"+
		"Found in his pocket too; and this, it seems,\n"+
		"Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain;\n"+
		"But that belike Iago in the interim\n"+
		"Came in and satisfied him.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"O the pernicious caitiff!\n"+
		"How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief\n"+
		"That was my wife's?\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"I found it in my chamber:\n"+
		"And he himself confess'd but even now\n"+
		"That there he dropp'd it for a special purpose\n"+
		"Which wrought to his desire.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"O fool! fool! fool!\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"There is besides in Roderigo's letter,\n"+
		"How he upbraids Iago, that he made him\n"+
		"Brave me upon the watch; whereon it came\n"+
		"That I was cast: and even but now he spake,\n"+
		"After long seeming dead, Iago hurt him,\n"+
		"Iago set him on.\n"+
		"LODOVICO\n"+
		"You must forsake this room, and go with us:\n"+
		"Your power and your command is taken off,\n"+
		"And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave,\n"+
		"If there be any cunning cruelty\n"+
		"That can torment him much and hold him long,\n"+
		"It shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest,\n"+
		"Till that the nature of your fault be known\n"+
		"To the Venetian state. Come, bring him away.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"Soft you; a word or two before you go.\n"+
		"I have done the state some service, and they know't.\n"+
		"No more of that. I pray you, in your letters,\n"+
		"When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,\n"+
		"Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate,\n"+
		"Nor set down aught in malice: then must you speak\n"+
		"Of one that loved not wisely but too well;\n"+
		"Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought\n"+
		"Perplex'd in the extreme; of one whose hand,\n"+
		"Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away\n"+
		"Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdued eyes,\n"+
		"Albeit unused to the melting mood,\n"+
		"Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees\n"+
		"Their medicinal gum. Set you down this;\n"+
		"And say besides, that in Aleppo once,\n"+
		"Where a malignant and a turban'd Turk\n"+
		"Beat a Venetian and traduced the state,\n"+
		"I took by the throat the circumcised dog,\n"+
		"And smote him, thus.\n"+
		"Stabs himself\n"+
		"LODOVICO\n"+
		"O bloody period!\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"All that's spoke is marr'd.\n"+
		"OTHELLO\n"+
		"I kiss'd thee ere I kill'd thee: no way but this;\n"+
		"Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.\n"+
		"Falls on the bed, and dies\n"+
		"CASSIO\n"+
		"This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon;\n"+
		"For he was great of heart.\n"+
		"LODOVICO\n"+
		"[To IAGO] O Spartan dog,\n"+
		"More fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea!\n"+
		"Look on the tragic loading of this bed;\n"+
		"This is thy work: the object poisons sight;\n"+
		"Let it be hid. Gratiano, keep the house,\n"+
		"And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor,\n"+
		"For they succeed on you. To you, lord governor,\n"+
		"Remains the censure of this hellish villain;\n"+
		"The time, the place, the torture: O, enforce it!\n"+
		"Myself will straight aboard: and to the state\n"+
		"This heavy act with heavy heart relate.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"
