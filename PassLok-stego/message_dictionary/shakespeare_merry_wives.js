		"despise one that is false, or as I despise one that\n"+

		"broke open my lodge.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"But not kissed your keeper's daughter?\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"Tut, a pin! this shall be answered.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"I will answer it straight; I have done all this.\n"+
		"That is now answered.\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"The council shall know this.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"'Twere better for you if it were known in counsel:\n"+
		"you'll be laughed at.\n"+
		"SIR HUGH EVANS\n"+
		"Pauca verba, Sir John; goot worts.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Good worts! good cabbage. Slender, I broke your\n"+
		"head: what matter have you against me?\n"+
		"SLENDER\n"+
		"Marry, sir, I have matter in my head against you;\n"+
		"and against your cony-catching rascals, Bardolph,\n"+
		"Nym, and Pistol.\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"You Banbury cheese!\n"+
		"SLENDER\n"+
		"Ay, it is no matter.\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"How now, Mephostophilus!\n"+
		"SLENDER\n"+
		"Ay, it is no matter.\n"+
		"NYM\n"+
		"Slice, I say! pauca, pauca: slice! that's my humour.\n"+
		"SLENDER\n"+
		"Where's Simple, my man? Can you tell, cousin?\n"+
		"SIR HUGH EVANS\n"+
		"Peace, I pray you. Now let us understand. There is\n"+
		"three umpires in this matter, as I understand; that\n"+
		"is, Master Page, fidelicet Master Page; and there is\n"+
		"myself, fidelicet myself; and the three party is,\n"+
		"lastly and finally, mine host of the Garter.\n"+
		"PAGE\n"+
		"We three, to hear it and end it between them.\n"+
		"SIR HUGH EVANS\n"+
		"Fery goot: I will make a prief of it in my note-\n"+
		"book; and we will afterwards ork upon the cause with\n"+
		"as great discreetly as we can.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Pistol!\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"He hears with ears.\n"+
		"SIR HUGH EVANS\n"+
		"The tevil and his tam! what phrase is this, 'He\n"+
		"hears with ear'? why, it is affectations.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Pistol, did you pick Master Slender's purse?\n"+
		"SLENDER\n"+
		"Ay, by these gloves, did he, or I would I might\n"+
		"never come in mine own great chamber again else, of\n"+
		"seven groats in mill-sixpences, and two Edward\n"+
		"shovel-boards, that cost me two shilling and two\n"+
		"pence apiece of Yead Miller, by these gloves.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Is this true, Pistol?\n"+
		"SIR HUGH EVANS\n"+
		"No; it is false, if it is a pick-purse.\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"Ha, thou mountain-foreigner! Sir John and Master mine,\n"+
		"I combat challenge of this latten bilbo.\n"+
		"Word of denial in thy labras here!\n"+
		"Word of denial: froth and scum, thou liest!\n"+
		"SLENDER\n"+
		"By these gloves, then, 'twas he.\n"+
		"NYM\n"+
		"Be avised, sir, and pass good humours: I will say\n"+
		"'marry trap' with you, if you run the nuthook's\n"+
		"humour on me; that is the very note of it.\n"+
		"SLENDER\n"+
		"By this hat, then, he in the red face had it; for\n"+
		"though I cannot remember what I did when you made me\n"+
		"drunk, yet I am not altogether an ass.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"What say you, Scarlet and John?\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Why, sir, for my part I say the gentleman had drunk\n"+
		"himself out of his five sentences.\n"+
		"SIR HUGH EVANS\n"+
		"It is his five senses: fie, what the ignorance is!\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"And being fap, sir, was, as they say, cashiered; and\n"+
		"so conclusions passed the careires.\n"+
		"SLENDER\n"+
		"Ay, you spake in Latin then too; but 'tis no\n"+
		"matter: I'll ne'er be drunk whilst I live again,\n"+
		"but in honest, civil, godly company, for this trick:\n"+
		"if I be drunk, I'll be drunk with those that have\n"+
		"the fear of God, and not with drunken knaves.\n"+
		"SIR HUGH EVANS\n"+
		"So Got udge me, that is a virtuous mind.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"You hear all these matters denied, gentlemen; you hear it.\n"+
		"Enter ANNE PAGE, with wine; MISTRESS FORD and MISTRESS PAGE, following\n"+
		"PAGE\n"+
		"Nay, daughter, carry the wine in; we'll drink within.\n"+
		"Exit ANNE PAGE\n"+
		"SLENDER\n"+
		"O heaven! this is Mistress Anne Page.\n"+
		"PAGE\n"+
		"How now, Mistress Ford!\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Mistress Ford, by my troth, you are very well met:\n"+
		"by your leave, good mistress.\n"+
		"Kisses her\n"+
		"PAGE\n"+
		"Wife, bid these gentlemen welcome. Come, we have a\n"+
		"hot venison pasty to dinner: come, gentlemen, I hope\n"+
		"we shall drink down all unkindness.\n"+
		"Exeunt all except SHALLOW, SLENDER, and SIR HUGH EVANS\n"+
		"SLENDER\n"+
		"I had rather than forty shillings I had my Book of\n"+
		"Songs and Sonnets here.\n"+
		"Enter SIMPLE\n"+
		"How now, Simple! where have you been? I must wait\n"+
		"on myself, must I? You have not the Book of Riddles\n"+
		"about you, have you?\n"+
		"SIMPLE\n"+
		"Book of Riddles! why, did you not lend it to Alice\n"+
		"Shortcake upon All-hallowmas last, a fortnight\n"+
		"afore Michaelmas?\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"Come, coz; come, coz; we stay for you. A word with\n"+
		"you, coz; marry, this, coz: there is, as 'twere, a\n"+
		"tender, a kind of tender, made afar off by Sir Hugh\n"+
		"here. Do you understand me?\n"+
		"SLENDER\n"+
		"Ay, sir, you shall find me reasonable; if it be so,\n"+
		"I shall do that that is reason.\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"Nay, but understand me.\n"+
		"SLENDER\n"+
		"So I do, sir.\n"+
		"SIR HUGH EVANS\n"+
		"Give ear to his motions, Master Slender: I will\n"+
		"description the matter to you, if you be capacity of it.\n"+
		"SLENDER\n"+
		"Nay, I will do as my cousin Shallow says: I pray\n"+
		"you, pardon me; he's a justice of peace in his\n"+
		"country, simple though I stand here.\n"+
		"SIR HUGH EVANS\n"+
		"But that is not the question: the question is\n"+
		"concerning your marriage.\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"Ay, there's the point, sir.\n"+
		"SIR HUGH EVANS\n"+
		"Marry, is it; the very point of it; to Mistress Anne Page.\n"+
		"SLENDER\n"+
		"Why, if it be so, I will marry her upon any\n"+
		"reasonable demands.\n"+
		"SIR HUGH EVANS\n"+
		"But can you affection the 'oman? Let us command to\n"+
		"know that of your mouth or of your lips; for divers\n"+
		"philosophers hold that the lips is parcel of the\n"+
		"mouth. Therefore, precisely, can you carry your\n"+
		"good will to the maid?\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"Cousin Abraham Slender, can you love her?\n"+
		"SLENDER\n"+
		"I hope, sir, I will do as it shall become one that\n"+
		"would do reason.\n"+
		"SIR HUGH EVANS\n"+
		"Nay, Got's lords and his ladies! you must speak\n"+
		"possitable, if you can carry her your desires\n"+
		"towards her.\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"That you must. Will you, upon good dowry, marry her?\n"+
		"SLENDER\n"+
		"I will do a greater thing than that, upon your\n"+
		"request, cousin, in any reason.\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"Nay, conceive me, conceive me, sweet coz: what I do\n"+
		"is to pleasure you, coz. Can you love the maid?\n"+
		"SLENDER\n"+
		"I will marry her, sir, at your request: but if there\n"+
		"be no great love in the beginning, yet heaven may\n"+
		"decrease it upon better acquaintance, when we are\n"+
		"married and have more occasion to know one another;\n"+
		"I hope, upon familiarity will grow more contempt:\n"+
		"but if you say, 'Marry her,' I will marry her; that\n"+
		"I am freely dissolved, and dissolutely.\n"+
		"SIR HUGH EVANS\n"+
		"It is a fery discretion answer; save the fall is in\n"+
		"the ort 'dissolutely:' the ort is, according to our\n"+
		"meaning, 'resolutely:' his meaning is good.\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"Ay, I think my cousin meant well.\n"+
		"SLENDER\n"+
		"Ay, or else I would I might be hanged, la!\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"Here comes fair Mistress Anne.\n"+
		"Re-enter ANNE PAGE\n"+
		"Would I were young for your sake, Mistress Anne!\n"+
		"ANNE PAGE\n"+
		"The dinner is on the table; my father desires your\n"+
		"worships' company.\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"I will wait on him, fair Mistress Anne.\n"+
		"SIR HUGH EVANS\n"+
		"Od's plessed will! I will not be absence at the grace.\n"+
		"Exeunt SHALLOW and SIR HUGH EVANS\n"+
		"ANNE PAGE\n"+
		"Will't please your worship to come in, sir?\n"+
		"SLENDER\n"+
		"No, I thank you, forsooth, heartily; I am very well.\n"+
		"ANNE PAGE\n"+
		"The dinner attends you, sir.\n"+
		"SLENDER\n"+
		"I am not a-hungry, I thank you, forsooth. Go,\n"+
		"sirrah, for all you are my man, go wait upon my\n"+
		"cousin Shallow.\n"+
		"Exit SIMPLE\n"+
		"A justice of peace sometimes may be beholding to his\n"+
		"friend for a man. I keep but three men and a boy\n"+
		"yet, till my mother be dead: but what though? Yet I\n"+
		"live like a poor gentleman born.\n"+
		"ANNE PAGE\n"+
		"I may not go in without your worship: they will not\n"+
		"sit till you come.\n"+
		"SLENDER\n"+
		"I' faith, I'll eat nothing; I thank you as much as\n"+
		"though I did.\n"+
		"ANNE PAGE\n"+
		"I pray you, sir, walk in.\n"+
		"SLENDER\n"+
		"I had rather walk here, I thank you. I bruised\n"+
		"my shin th' other day with playing at sword and\n"+
		"dagger with a master of fence; three veneys for a\n"+
		"dish of stewed prunes; and, by my troth, I cannot\n"+
		"abide the smell of hot meat since. Why do your\n"+
		"dogs bark so? be there bears i' the town?\n"+
		"ANNE PAGE\n"+
		"I think there are, sir; I heard them talked of.\n"+
		"SLENDER\n"+
		"I love the sport well but I shall as soon quarrel at\n"+
		"it as any man in England. You are afraid, if you see\n"+
		"the bear loose, are you not?\n"+
		"ANNE PAGE\n"+
		"Ay, indeed, sir.\n"+
		"SLENDER\n"+
		"That's meat and drink to me, now. I have seen\n"+
		"Sackerson loose twenty times, and have taken him by\n"+
		"the chain; but, I warrant you, the women have so\n"+
		"cried and shrieked at it, that it passed: but women,\n"+
		"indeed, cannot abide 'em; they are very ill-favored\n"+
		"rough things.\n"+
		"Re-enter PAGE\n"+
		"PAGE\n"+
		"Come, gentle Master Slender, come; we stay for you.\n"+
		"SLENDER\n"+
		"I'll eat nothing, I thank you, sir.\n"+
		"PAGE\n"+
		"By cock and pie, you shall not choose, sir! come, come.\n"+
		"SLENDER\n"+
		"Nay, pray you, lead the way.\n"+
		"PAGE\n"+
		"Come on, sir.\n"+
		"SLENDER\n"+
		"Mistress Anne, yourself shall go first.\n"+
		"ANNE PAGE\n"+
		"Not I, sir; pray you, keep on.\n"+
		"SLENDER\n"+
		"I'll rather be unmannerly than troublesome.\n"+
		"You do yourself wrong, indeed, la!\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. The same.\n"+
		"Enter SIR HUGH EVANS and SIMPLE\n"+
		"SIR HUGH EVANS\n"+
		"Go your ways, and ask of Doctor Caius' house which\n"+
		"is the way: and there dwells one Mistress Quickly,\n"+
		"which is in the manner of his nurse, or his dry\n"+
		"nurse, or his cook, or his laundry, his washer, and\n"+
		"his wringer.\n"+
		"SIMPLE\n"+
		"Well, sir.\n"+
		"SIR HUGH EVANS\n"+
		"Nay, it is petter yet. Give her this letter; for it\n"+
		"is a 'oman that altogether's acquaintance with\n"+
		"Mistress Anne Page: and the letter is, to desire\n"+
		"and require her to solicit your master's desires to\n"+
		"Mistress Anne Page. I pray you, be gone: I will\n"+
		"make an end of my dinner; there's pippins and cheese to come.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. A room in the Garter Inn.\n"+
		"Enter FALSTAFF, Host, BARDOLPH, NYM, PISTOL, and ROBIN\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Mine host of the Garter!\n"+
		"Host\n"+
		"What says my bully-rook? speak scholarly and wisely.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Truly, mine host, I must turn away some of my\n"+
		"followers.\n"+
		"Host\n"+
		"Discard, bully Hercules; cashier: let them wag; trot, trot.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"I sit at ten pounds a week.\n"+
		"Host\n"+
		"Thou'rt an emperor, Caesar, Keisar, and Pheezar. I\n"+
		"will entertain Bardolph; he shall draw, he shall\n"+
		"tap: said I well, bully Hector?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Do so, good mine host.\n"+
		"Host\n"+
		"I have spoke; let him follow.\n"+
		"To BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Let me see thee froth and lime: I am at a word; follow.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Bardolph, follow him. A tapster is a good trade:\n"+
		"an old cloak makes a new jerkin; a withered\n"+
		"serving-man a fresh tapster. Go; adieu.\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"It is a life that I have desired: I will thrive.\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"O base Hungarian wight! wilt thou the spigot wield?\n"+
		"Exit BARDOLPH\n"+
		"NYM\n"+
		"He was gotten in drink: is not the humour conceited?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"I am glad I am so acquit of this tinderbox: his\n"+
		"thefts were too open; his filching was like an\n"+
		"unskilful singer; he kept not time.\n"+
		"NYM\n"+
		"The good humour is to steal at a minute's rest.\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"'Convey,' the wise it call. 'Steal!' foh! a fico\n"+
		"for the phrase!\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Well, sirs, I am almost out at heels.\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"Why, then, let kibes ensue.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"There is no remedy; I must cony-catch; I must shift.\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"Young ravens must have food.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Which of you know Ford of this town?\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"I ken the wight: he is of substance good.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"My honest lads, I will tell you what I am about.\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"Two yards, and more.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"No quips now, Pistol! Indeed, I am in the waist two\n"+
		"yards about; but I am now about no waste; I am about\n"+
		"thrift. Briefly, I do mean to make love to Ford's\n"+
		"wife: I spy entertainment in her; she discourses,\n"+
		"she carves, she gives the leer of invitation: I\n"+
		"can construe the action of her familiar style; and\n"+
		"the hardest voice of her behavior, to be Englished\n"+
		"rightly, is, 'I am Sir John Falstaff's.'\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"He hath studied her will, and translated her will,\n"+
		"out of honesty into English.\n"+
		"NYM\n"+
		"The anchor is deep: will that humour pass?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Now, the report goes she has all the rule of her\n"+
		"husband's purse: he hath a legion of angels.\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"As many devils entertain; and 'To her, boy,' say I.\n"+
		"NYM\n"+
		"The humour rises; it is good: humour me the angels.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"I have writ me here a letter to her: and here\n"+
		"another to Page's wife, who even now gave me good\n"+
		"eyes too, examined my parts with most judicious\n"+
		"oeillades; sometimes the beam of her view gilded my\n"+
		"foot, sometimes my portly belly.\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"Then did the sun on dunghill shine.\n"+
		"NYM\n"+
		"I thank thee for that humour.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"O, she did so course o'er my exteriors with such a\n"+
		"greedy intention, that the appetite of her eye did\n"+
		"seem to scorch me up like a burning-glass! Here's\n"+
		"another letter to her: she bears the purse too; she\n"+
		"is a region in Guiana, all gold and bounty. I will\n"+
		"be cheater to them both, and they shall be\n"+
		"exchequers to me; they shall be my East and West\n"+
		"Indies, and I will trade to them both. Go bear thou\n"+
		"this letter to Mistress Page; and thou this to\n"+
		"Mistress Ford: we will thrive, lads, we will thrive.\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"Shall I Sir Pandarus of Troy become,\n"+
		"And by my side wear steel? then, Lucifer take all!\n"+
		"NYM\n"+
		"I will run no base humour: here, take the\n"+
		"humour-letter: I will keep the havior of reputation.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"[To ROBIN] Hold, sirrah, bear you these letters tightly;\n"+
		"Sail like my pinnace to these golden shores.\n"+

		"An honest, willing, kind fellow, as ever servant\n"+

		"little yellow beard, a Cain-coloured beard.\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"A softly-sprighted man, is he not?\n"+
		"SIMPLE\n"+
		"Ay, forsooth: but he is as tall a man of his hands\n"+

		"FENTON\n"+
		"How now, good woman? how dost thou?\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"The better that it pleases your good worship to ask.\n"+
		"FENTON\n"+
		"What news? how does pretty Mistress Anne?\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"In truth, sir, and she is pretty, and honest, and\n"+
		"gentle; and one that is your friend, I can tell you\n"+
		"that by the way; I praise heaven for it.\n"+
		"FENTON\n"+
		"Shall I do any good, thinkest thou? shall I not lose my suit?\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"Troth, sir, all is in his hands above: but\n"+
		"notwithstanding, Master Fenton, I'll be sworn on a\n"+

		"above your eye?\n"+
		"FENTON\n"+
		"Yes, marry, have I; what of that?\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"Well, thereby hangs a tale: good faith, it is such\n"+
		"another Nan; but, I detest, an honest maid as ever\n"+
		"broke bread: we had an hour's talk of that wart. I\n"+
		"shall never laugh but in that maid's company! But\n"+
		"indeed she is given too much to allicholy and\n"+
		"musing: but for you--well, go to.\n"+
		"FENTON\n"+
		"Well, I shall see her to-day. Hold, there's money\n"+
		"for thee; let me have thy voice in my behalf: if\n"+
		"thou seest her before me, commend me.\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"Will I? i'faith, that we will; and I will tell your\n"+

		"confidence; and of other wooers.\n"+
		"FENTON\n"+
		"Well, farewell; I am in great haste now.\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"Farewell to your worship.\n"+
		"Exit FENTON\n"+
		"Truly, an honest gentleman: but Anne loves him not;\n"+

		"Exit\n"+
		"ACT II\n"+
		"SCENE I. Before PAGE'S house.\n"+
		"Enter MISTRESS PAGE, with a letter\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"What, have I scaped love-letters in the holiday-\n"+
		"time of my beauty, and am I now a subject for them?\n"+
		"Let me see.\n"+
		"Reads\n"+
		"'Ask me no reason why I love you; for though\n"+
		"Love use Reason for his physician, he admits him\n"+
		"not for his counsellor. You are not young, no more\n"+
		"am I; go to then, there's sympathy: you are merry,\n"+
		"so am I; ha, ha! then there's more sympathy: you\n"+
		"love sack, and so do I; would you desire better\n"+
		"sympathy? Let it suffice thee, Mistress Page,--at\n"+
		"the least, if the love of soldier can suffice,--\n"+
		"that I love thee. I will not say, pity me; 'tis\n"+
		"not a soldier-like phrase: but I say, love me. By me,\n"+
		"Thine own true knight,\n"+
		"By day or night,\n"+
		"Or any kind of light,\n"+
		"With all his might\n"+
		"For thee to fight, JOHN FALSTAFF'\n"+
		"What a Herod of Jewry is this! O wicked\n"+
		"world! One that is well-nigh worn to pieces with\n"+
		"age to show himself a young gallant! What an\n"+
		"unweighed behavior hath this Flemish drunkard\n"+
		"picked--with the devil's name!--out of my\n"+
		"conversation, that he dares in this manner assay me?\n"+
		"Why, he hath not been thrice in my company! What\n"+
		"should I say to him? I was then frugal of my\n"+
		"mirth: Heaven forgive me! Why, I'll exhibit a bill\n"+
		"in the parliament for the putting down of men. How\n"+
		"shall I be revenged on him? for revenged I will be,\n"+
		"as sure as his guts are made of puddings.\n"+
		"Enter MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"Mistress Page! trust me, I was going to your house.\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"And, trust me, I was coming to you. You look very\n"+
		"ill.\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"Nay, I'll ne'er believe that; I have to show to the contrary.\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"Faith, but you do, in my mind.\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"Well, I do then; yet I say I could show you to the\n"+
		"contrary. O Mistress Page, give me some counsel!\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"What's the matter, woman?\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"O woman, if it were not for one trifling respect, I\n"+
		"could come to such honour!\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"Hang the trifle, woman! take the honour. What is\n"+
		"it? dispense with trifles; what is it?\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"If I would but go to hell for an eternal moment or so,\n"+
		"I could be knighted.\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"What? thou liest! Sir Alice Ford! These knights\n"+
		"will hack; and so thou shouldst not alter the\n"+
		"article of thy gentry.\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"We burn daylight: here, read, read; perceive how I\n"+
		"might be knighted. I shall think the worse of fat\n"+
		"men, as long as I have an eye to make difference of\n"+
		"men's liking: and yet he would not swear; praised\n"+
		"women's modesty; and gave such orderly and\n"+
		"well-behaved reproof to all uncomeliness, that I\n"+
		"would have sworn his disposition would have gone to\n"+
		"the truth of his words; but they do no more adhere\n"+
		"and keep place together than the Hundredth Psalm to\n"+
		"the tune of 'Green Sleeves.' What tempest, I trow,\n"+
		"threw this whale, with so many tuns of oil in his\n"+
		"belly, ashore at Windsor? How shall I be revenged\n"+
		"on him? I think the best way were to entertain him\n"+
		"with hope, till the wicked fire of lust have melted\n"+
		"him in his own grease. Did you ever hear the like?\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"Letter for letter, but that the name of Page and\n"+
		"Ford differs! To thy great comfort in this mystery\n"+
		"of ill opinions, here's the twin-brother of thy\n"+
		"letter: but let thine inherit first; for, I\n"+
		"protest, mine never shall. I warrant he hath a\n"+
		"thousand of these letters, writ with blank space for\n"+
		"different names--sure, more,--and these are of the\n"+
		"second edition: he will print them, out of doubt;\n"+
		"for he cares not what he puts into the press, when\n"+
		"he would put us two. I had rather be a giantess,\n"+
		"and lie under Mount Pelion. Well, I will find you\n"+
		"twenty lascivious turtles ere one chaste man.\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"Why, this is the very same; the very hand, the very\n"+
		"words. What doth he think of us?\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"Nay, I know not: it makes me almost ready to\n"+
		"wrangle with mine own honesty. I'll entertain\n"+
		"myself like one that I am not acquainted withal;\n"+
		"for, sure, unless he know some strain in me, that I\n"+
		"know not myself, he would never have boarded me in this fury.\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"'Boarding,' call you it? I'll be sure to keep him\n"+
		"above deck.\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"So will I if he come under my hatches, I'll never\n"+
		"to sea again. Let's be revenged on him: let's\n"+
		"appoint him a meeting; give him a show of comfort in\n"+
		"his suit and lead him on with a fine-baited delay,\n"+
		"till he hath pawned his horses to mine host of the Garter.\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"Nay, I will consent to act any villany against him,\n"+
		"that may not sully the chariness of our honesty. O,\n"+
		"that my husband saw this letter! it would give\n"+
		"eternal food to his jealousy.\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"Why, look where he comes; and my good man too: he's\n"+
		"as far from jealousy as I am from giving him cause;\n"+
		"and that I hope is an unmeasurable distance.\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"You are the happier woman.\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"Let's consult together against this greasy knight.\n"+
		"Come hither.\n"+
		"They retire\n"+
		"Enter FORD with PISTOL, and PAGE with NYM\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"Well, I hope it be not so.\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"Hope is a curtal dog in some affairs:\n"+
		"Sir John affects thy wife.\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"Why, sir, my wife is not young.\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"He wooes both high and low, both rich and poor,\n"+
		"Both young and old, one with another, Ford;\n"+

		"FORD\n"+
		"Love my wife!\n"+

		"With liver burning hot. Prevent, or go thou,\n"+
		"Like Sir Actaeon he, with Ringwood at thy heels:\n"+
		"O, odious is the name!\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"What name, sir?\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"The horn, I say. Farewell.\n"+
		"Take heed, have open eye, for thieves do foot by night:\n"+
		"Take heed, ere summer comes or cuckoo-birds do sing.\n"+
		"Away, Sir Corporal Nym!\n"+
		"Believe it, Page; he speaks sense.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"[Aside] I will be patient; I will find out this.\n"+
		"NYM\n"+
		"[To PAGE] And this is true; I like not the humour\n"+
		"of lying. He hath wronged me in some humours: I\n"+
		"should have borne the humoured letter to her; but I\n"+

		"He loves your wife; there's the short and the long.\n"+
		"My name is Corporal Nym; I speak and I avouch; 'tis\n"+

		"Hang 'em, slaves! I do not think the knight would\n"+

		"FORD\n"+
		"Were they his men?\n"+
		"PAGE\n"+
		"Marry, were they.\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"I like it never the better for that. Does he lie at\n"+

		"My hand, bully; thou shalt have egress and regress;\n"+
		"--said I well?--and thy name shall be Brook. It is\n"+

		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"Have with you, mine host.\n"+
		"PAGE\n"+
		"I have heard the Frenchman hath good skill in\n"+
		"his rapier.\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"Tut, sir, I could have told you more. In these times\n"+
		"you stand on distance, your passes, stoccadoes, and\n"+
		"I know not what: 'tis the heart, Master Page; 'tis\n"+
		"here, 'tis here. I have seen the time, with my long\n"+
		"sword I would have made you four tall fellows skip like rats.\n"+
		"Host\n"+
		"Here, boys, here, here! shall we wag?\n"+
		"PAGE\n"+
		"Have with you. I would rather hear them scold than fight.\n"+
		"Exeunt Host, SHALLOW, and PAGE\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"Though Page be a secure fool, an stands so firmly\n"+
		"on his wife's frailty, yet I cannot put off my\n"+
		"opinion so easily: she was in his company at Page's\n"+
		"house; and what they made there, I know not. Well,\n"+
		"I will look further into't: and I have a disguise\n"+
		"to sound Falstaff. If I find her honest, I lose not\n"+
		"my labour; if she be otherwise, 'tis labour well bestowed.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE II. A room in the Garter Inn.\n"+
		"Enter FALSTAFF and PISTOL\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"I will not lend thee a penny.\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"Why, then the world's mine oyster.\n"+
		"Which I with sword will open.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Not a penny. I have been content, sir, you should\n"+
		"lay my countenance to pawn; I have grated upon my\n"+
		"good friends for three reprieves for you and your\n"+
		"coach-fellow Nym; or else you had looked through\n"+
		"the grate, like a geminy of baboons. I am damned in\n"+
		"hell for swearing to gentlemen my friends, you were\n"+
		"good soldiers and tall fellows; and when Mistress\n"+
		"Bridget lost the handle of her fan, I took't upon\n"+
		"mine honour thou hadst it not.\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"Didst not thou share? hadst thou not fifteen pence?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Reason, you rogue, reason: thinkest thou I'll\n"+
		"endanger my soul gratis? At a word, hang no more\n"+
		"about me, I am no gibbet for you. Go. A short knife\n"+
		"and a throng! To your manor of Pickt-hatch! Go.\n"+
		"You'll not bear a letter for me, you rogue! you\n"+
		"stand upon your honour! Why, thou unconfinable\n"+
		"baseness, it is as much as I can do to keep the\n"+
		"terms of my honour precise: I, I, I myself\n"+
		"sometimes, leaving the fear of God on the left hand\n"+
		"and hiding mine honour in my necessity, am fain to\n"+
		"shuffle, to hedge and to lurch; and yet you, rogue,\n"+
		"will ensconce your rags, your cat-a-mountain\n"+
		"looks, your red-lattice phrases, and your\n"+
		"bold-beating oaths, under the shelter of your\n"+
		"honour! You will not do it, you!\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"I do relent: what would thou more of man?\n"+
		"Enter ROBIN\n"+
		"ROBIN\n"+
		"Sir, here's a woman would speak with you.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Let her approach.\n"+
		"Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"Give your worship good morrow.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Good morrow, good wife.\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"Not so, an't please your worship.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Good maid, then.\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"I'll be sworn,\n"+
		"As my mother was, the first hour I was born.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"I do believe the swearer. What with me?\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"Shall I vouchsafe your worship a word or two?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Two thousand, fair woman: and I'll vouchsafe thee\n"+
		"the hearing.\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"There is one Mistress Ford, sir:--I pray, come a\n"+
		"little nearer this ways:--I myself dwell with master\n"+
		"Doctor Caius,--\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Well, on: Mistress Ford, you say,--\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"Your worship says very true: I pray your worship,\n"+
		"come a little nearer this ways.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"I warrant thee, nobody hears; mine own people, mine\n"+
		"own people.\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"Are they so? God bless them and make them his servants!\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Well, Mistress Ford; what of her?\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"Why, sir, she's a good creature. Lord Lord! your\n"+
		"worship's a wanton! Well, heaven forgive you and all\n"+
		"of us, I pray!\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Mistress Ford; come, Mistress Ford,--\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"Marry, this is the short and the long of it; you\n"+
		"have brought her into such a canaries as 'tis\n"+
		"wonderful. The best courtier of them all, when the\n"+
		"court lay at Windsor, could never have brought her\n"+
		"to such a canary. Yet there has been knights, and\n"+
		"lords, and gentlemen, with their coaches, I warrant\n"+
		"you, coach after coach, letter after letter, gift\n"+
		"after gift; smelling so sweetly, all musk, and so\n"+
		"rushling, I warrant you, in silk and gold; and in\n"+
		"such alligant terms; and in such wine and sugar of\n"+
		"the best and the fairest, that would have won any\n"+
		"woman's heart; and, I warrant you, they could never\n"+
		"get an eye-wink of her: I had myself twenty angels\n"+
		"given me this morning; but I defy all angels, in\n"+
		"any such sort, as they say, but in the way of\n"+
		"honesty: and, I warrant you, they could never get\n"+
		"her so much as sip on a cup with the proudest of\n"+
		"them all: and yet there has been earls, nay, which\n"+
		"is more, pensioners; but, I warrant you, all is one with her.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"But what says she to me? be brief, my good\n"+
		"she-Mercury.\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"Marry, she hath received your letter, for the which\n"+
		"she thanks you a thousand times; and she gives you\n"+
		"to notify that her husband will be absence from his\n"+
		"house between ten and eleven.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Ten and eleven?\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"Ay, forsooth; and then you may come and see the\n"+
		"picture, she says, that you wot of: Master Ford,\n"+
		"her husband, will be from home. Alas! the sweet\n"+
		"woman leads an ill life with him: he's a very\n"+
		"jealousy man: she leads a very frampold life with\n"+
		"him, good heart.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Ten and eleven. Woman, commend me to her; I will\n"+
		"not fail her.\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"Why, you say well. But I have another messenger to\n"+
		"your worship. Mistress Page hath her hearty\n"+
		"commendations to you too: and let me tell you in\n"+
		"your ear, she's as fartuous a civil modest wife, and\n"+
		"one, I tell you, that will not miss you morning nor\n"+
		"evening prayer, as any is in Windsor, whoe'er be the\n"+
		"other: and she bade me tell your worship that her\n"+
		"husband is seldom from home; but she hopes there\n"+
		"will come a time. I never knew a woman so dote upon\n"+
		"a man: surely I think you have charms, la; yes, in truth.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Not I, I assure thee: setting the attractions of my\n"+
		"good parts aside I have no other charms.\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"Blessing on your heart for't!\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"But, I pray thee, tell me this: has Ford's wife and\n"+
		"Page's wife acquainted each other how they love me?\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"That were a jest indeed! they have not so little\n"+
		"grace, I hope: that were a trick indeed! but\n"+
		"Mistress Page would desire you to send her your\n"+
		"little page, of all loves: her husband has a\n"+
		"marvellous infection to the little page; and truly\n"+
		"Master Page is an honest man. Never a wife in\n"+
		"Windsor leads a better life than she does: do what\n"+
		"she will, say what she will, take all, pay all, go\n"+
		"to bed when she list, rise when she list, all is as\n"+
		"she will: and truly she deserves it; for if there\n"+
		"be a kind woman in Windsor, she is one. You must\n"+
		"send her your page; no remedy.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Why, I will.\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"Nay, but do so, then: and, look you, he may come and\n"+
		"go between you both; and in any case have a\n"+
		"nay-word, that you may know one another's mind, and\n"+
		"the boy never need to understand any thing; for\n"+
		"'tis not good that children should know any\n"+
		"wickedness: old folks, you know, have discretion,\n"+
		"as they say, and know the world.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Fare thee well: commend me to them both: there's\n"+
		"my purse; I am yet thy debtor. Boy, go along with\n"+
		"this woman.\n"+
		"Exeunt MISTRESS QUICKLY and ROBIN\n"+
		"This news distracts me!\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"This punk is one of Cupid's carriers:\n"+
		"Clap on more sails; pursue; up with your fights:\n"+
		"Give fire: she is my prize, or ocean whelm them all!\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Sayest thou so, old Jack? go thy ways; I'll make\n"+
		"more of thy old body than I have done. Will they\n"+
		"yet look after thee? Wilt thou, after the expense\n"+
		"of so much money, be now a gainer? Good body, I\n"+
		"thank thee. Let them say 'tis grossly done; so it be\n"+
		"fairly done, no matter.\n"+
		"Enter BARDOLPH\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Sir John, there's one Master Brook below would fain\n"+
		"speak with you, and be acquainted with you; and hath\n"+
		"sent your worship a morning's draught of sack.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Brook is his name?\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Ay, sir.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Call him in.\n"+
		"Exit BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Such Brooks are welcome to me, that o'erflow such\n"+
		"liquor. Ah, ha! Mistress Ford and Mistress Page\n"+
		"have I encompassed you? go to; via!\n"+
		"Re-enter BARDOLPH, with FORD disguised\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"Bless you, sir!\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"And you, sir! Would you speak with me?\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"I make bold to press with so little preparation upon\n"+
		"you.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"You're welcome. What's your will? Give us leave, drawer.\n"+
		"Exit BARDOLPH\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"Sir, I am a gentleman that have spent much; my name is Brook.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Good Master Brook, I desire more acquaintance of you.\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"Good Sir John, I sue for yours: not to charge you;\n"+
		"for I must let you understand I think myself in\n"+
		"better plight for a lender than you are: the which\n"+
		"hath something embolden'd me to this unseasoned\n"+
		"intrusion; for they say, if money go before, all\n"+
		"ways do lie open.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Money is a good soldier, sir, and will on.\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"Troth, and I have a bag of money here troubles me:\n"+
		"if you will help to bear it, Sir John, take all, or\n"+
		"half, for easing me of the carriage.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Sir, I know not how I may deserve to be your porter.\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"I will tell you, sir, if you will give me the hearing.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Speak, good Master Brook: I shall be glad to be\n"+
		"your servant.\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"Sir, I hear you are a scholar,--I will be brief\n"+
		"with you,--and you have been a man long known to me,\n"+
		"though I had never so good means, as desire, to make\n"+
		"myself acquainted with you. I shall discover a\n"+
		"thing to you, wherein I must very much lay open mine\n"+
		"own imperfection: but, good Sir John, as you have\n"+
		"one eye upon my follies, as you hear them unfolded,\n"+
		"turn another into the register of your own; that I\n"+
		"may pass with a reproof the easier, sith you\n"+
		"yourself know how easy it is to be such an offender.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Very well, sir; proceed.\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"There is a gentlewoman in this town; her husband's\n"+
		"name is Ford.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Well, sir.\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"I have long loved her, and, I protest to you,\n"+
		"bestowed much on her; followed her with a doting\n"+
		"observance; engrossed opportunities to meet her;\n"+
		"fee'd every slight occasion that could but niggardly\n"+
		"give me sight of her; not only bought many presents\n"+
		"to give her, but have given largely to many to know\n"+
		"what she would have given; briefly, I have pursued\n"+
		"her as love hath pursued me; which hath been on the\n"+
		"wing of all occasions. But whatsoever I have\n"+
		"merited, either in my mind or, in my means, meed,\n"+
		"I am sure, I have received none; unless experience\n"+
		"be a jewel that I have purchased at an infinite\n"+
		"rate, and that hath taught me to say this:\n"+
		"'Love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues;\n"+
		"Pursuing that that flies, and flying what pursues.'\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Have you received no promise of satisfaction at her hands?\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"Never.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Have you importuned her to such a purpose?\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"Never.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Of what quality was your love, then?\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"Like a fair house built on another man's ground; so\n"+
		"that I have lost my edifice by mistaking the place\n"+
		"where I erected it.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"To what purpose have you unfolded this to me?\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"When I have told you that, I have told you all.\n"+
		"Some say, that though she appear honest to me, yet in\n"+
		"other places she enlargeth her mirth so far that\n"+
		"there is shrewd construction made of her. Now, Sir\n"+
		"John, here is the heart of my purpose: you are a\n"+
		"gentleman of excellent breeding, admirable\n"+
		"discourse, of great admittance, authentic in your\n"+
		"place and person, generally allowed for your many\n"+
		"war-like, court-like, and learned preparations.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"O, sir!\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"Believe it, for you know it. There is money; spend\n"+
		"it, spend it; spend more; spend all I have; only\n"+
		"give me so much of your time in exchange of it, as\n"+
		"to lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this\n"+
		"Ford's wife: use your art of wooing; win her to\n"+
		"consent to you: if any man may, you may as soon as\n"+
		"any.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Would it apply well to the vehemency of your\n"+
		"affection, that I should win what you would enjoy?\n"+
		"Methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterously.\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"O, understand my drift. She dwells so securely on\n"+
		"the excellency of her honour, that the folly of my\n"+
		"soul dares not present itself: she is too bright to\n"+
		"be looked against. Now, could I could come to her\n"+
		"with any detection in my hand, my desires had\n"+
		"instance and argument to commend themselves: I\n"+
		"could drive her then from the ward of her purity,\n"+
		"her reputation, her marriage-vow, and a thousand\n"+
		"other her defences, which now are too too strongly\n"+
		"embattled against me. What say you to't, Sir John?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Master Brook, I will first make bold with your\n"+
		"money; next, give me your hand; and last, as I am a\n"+
		"gentleman, you shall, if you will, enjoy Ford's wife.\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"O good sir!\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"I say you shall.\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"Want no money, Sir John; you shall want none.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Want no Mistress Ford, Master Brook; you shall want\n"+
		"none. I shall be with her, I may tell you, by her\n"+
		"own appointment; even as you came in to me, her\n"+
		"assistant or go-between parted from me: I say I\n"+
		"shall be with her between ten and eleven; for at\n"+
		"that time the jealous rascally knave her husband\n"+
		"will be forth. Come you to me at night; you shall\n"+
		"know how I speed.\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"I am blest in your acquaintance. Do you know Ford,\n"+
		"sir?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Hang him, poor cuckoldly knave! I know him not:\n"+
		"yet I wrong him to call him poor; they say the\n"+
		"jealous wittolly knave hath masses of money; for the\n"+
		"which his wife seems to me well-favored. I will\n"+
		"use her as the key of the cuckoldly rogue's coffer;\n"+
		"and there's my harvest-home.\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"I would you knew Ford, sir, that you might avoid him\n"+
		"if you saw him.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Hang him, mechanical salt-butter rogue! I will\n"+
		"stare him out of his wits; I will awe him with my\n"+
		"cudgel: it shall hang like a meteor o'er the\n"+
		"cuckold's horns. Master Brook, thou shalt know I\n"+
		"will predominate over the peasant, and thou shalt\n"+
		"lie with his wife. Come to me soon at night.\n"+
		"Ford's a knave, and I will aggravate his style;\n"+
		"thou, Master Brook, shalt know him for knave and\n"+
		"cuckold. Come to me soon at night.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"What a damned Epicurean rascal is this! My heart is\n"+
		"ready to crack with impatience. Who says this is\n"+
		"improvident jealousy? my wife hath sent to him; the\n"+
		"hour is fixed; the match is made. Would any man\n"+
		"have thought this? See the hell of having a false\n"+
		"woman! My bed shall be abused, my coffers\n"+
		"ransacked, my reputation gnawn at; and I shall not\n"+
		"only receive this villanous wrong, but stand under\n"+
		"the adoption of abominable terms, and by him that\n"+
		"does me this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon sounds\n"+
		"well; Lucifer, well; Barbason, well; yet they are\n"+
		"devils' additions, the names of fiends: but\n"+
		"Cuckold! Wittol!--Cuckold! the devil himself hath\n"+
		"not such a name. Page is an ass, a secure ass: he\n"+
		"will trust his wife; he will not be jealous. I will\n"+
		"rather trust a Fleming with my butter, Parson Hugh\n"+
		"the Welshman with my cheese, an Irishman with my\n"+
		"aqua-vitae bottle, or a thief to walk my ambling\n"+
		"gelding, than my wife with herself; then she plots,\n"+
		"then she ruminates, then she devises; and what they\n"+
		"think in their hearts they may effect, they will\n"+
		"break their hearts but they will effect. God be\n"+
		"praised for my jealousy! Eleven o'clock the hour.\n"+
		"I will prevent this, detect my wife, be revenged on\n"+
		"Falstaff, and laugh at Page. I will about it;\n"+
		"better three hours too soon than a minute too late.\n"+
		"Fie, fie, fie! cuckold! cuckold! cuckold!\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE III. A field near Windsor.\n"+

		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"Nay, keep your way, little gallant; you were wont to\n"+

		"ROBIN\n"+
		"I had rather, forsooth, go before you like a man\n"+

		"FORD\n"+
		"Well met, Mistress Page. Whither go you?\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"Truly, sir, to see your wife. Is she at home?\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"Ay; and as idle as she may hang together, for want\n"+
		"of company. I think, if your husbands were dead,\n"+
		"you two would marry.\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"Be sure of that,--two other husbands.\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"Where had you this pretty weather-cock?\n"+

		"thinking? Sure, they sleep; he hath no use of them.\n"+
		"Why, this boy will carry a letter twenty mile, as\n"+
		"easy as a cannon will shoot point-blank twelve\n"+
		"score. He pieces out his wife's inclination; he\n"+
		"gives her folly motion and advantage: and now she's\n"+
		"going to my wife, and Falstaff's boy with her. A\n"+
		"man may hear this shower sing in the wind. And\n"+
		"Falstaff's boy with her! Good plots, they are laid;\n"+
		"and our revolted wives share damnation together.\n"+
		"Well; I will take him, then torture my wife, pluck\n"+
		"the borrowed veil of modesty from the so seeming\n"+
		"Mistress Page, divulge Page himself for a secure and\n"+

		"Clock heard\n"+
		"The clock gives me my cue, and my assurance bids me\n"+

		"more money than I'll speak of.\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"We have lingered about a match between Anne Page and\n"+
		"my cousin Slender, and this day we shall have our answer.\n"+
		"SLENDER\n"+
		"I hope I have your good will, father Page.\n"+
		"PAGE\n"+
		"You have, Master Slender; I stand wholly for you:\n"+

		"Host\n"+
		"What say you to young Master Fenton? he capers, he\n"+

		"carry't, he will carry't; 'tis in his buttons; he\n"+
		"will carry't.\n"+
		"PAGE\n"+
		"Not by my consent, I promise you. The gentleman is\n"+
		"of no having: he kept company with the wild prince\n"+
		"and Poins; he is of too high a region; he knows too\n"+
		"much. No, he shall not knit a knot in his fortunes\n"+
		"with the finger of my substance: if he take her,\n"+
		"let him take her simply; the wealth I have waits on\n"+
		"my consent, and my consent goes not that way.\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"I beseech you heartily, some of you go home with me\n"+
		"to dinner: besides your cheer, you shall have\n"+
		"sport; I will show you a monster. Master doctor,\n"+

		"Give your men the charge; we must be brief.\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+

		"suddenly call you, come forth, and without any pause\n"+
		"or staggering take this basket on your shoulders:\n"+
		"that done, trudge with it in all haste, and carry\n"+
		"it among the whitsters in Datchet-mead, and there\n"+
		"empty it in the muddy ditch close by the Thames side.\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"You will do it?\n"+

		"I ha' told them over and over; they lack no\n"+

		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"You little Jack-a-Lent, have you been true to us?\n"+
		"ROBIN\n"+
		"Ay, I'll be sworn. My master knows not of your\n"+

		"swears he'll turn me away.\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"Thou'rt a good boy: this secrecy of thine shall be\n"+

		"Do so. Go tell thy master I am alone.\n"+
		"Exit ROBIN\n"+
		"Mistress Page, remember you your cue.\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"I warrant thee; if I do not act it, hiss me.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"Go to, then: we'll use this unwholesome humidity,\n"+
		"this gross watery pumpion; we'll teach him to know\n"+
		"turtles from jays.\n"+
		"Enter FALSTAFF\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Have I caught thee, my heavenly jewel? Why, now let\n"+
		"me die, for I have lived long enough: this is the\n"+
		"period of my ambition: O this blessed hour!\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"O sweet Sir John!\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Mistress Ford, I cannot cog, I cannot prate,\n"+
		"Mistress Ford. Now shall I sin in my wish: I would\n"+
		"thy husband were dead: I'll speak it before the\n"+
		"best lord; I would make thee my lady.\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"I your lady, Sir John! alas, I should be a pitiful lady!\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Let the court of France show me such another. I see\n"+
		"how thine eye would emulate the diamond: thou hast\n"+
		"the right arched beauty of the brow that becomes the\n"+
		"ship-tire, the tire-valiant, or any tire of\n"+
		"Venetian admittance.\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"A plain kerchief, Sir John: my brows become nothing\n"+
		"else; nor that well neither.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"By the Lord, thou art a traitor to say so: thou\n"+
		"wouldst make an absolute courtier; and the firm\n"+
		"fixture of thy foot would give an excellent motion\n"+
		"to thy gait in a semi-circled farthingale. I see\n"+
		"what thou wert, if Fortune thy foe were not, Nature\n"+
		"thy friend. Come, thou canst not hide it.\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"Believe me, there is no such thing in me.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"What made me love thee? let that persuade thee\n"+
		"there's something extraordinary in thee. Come, I\n"+
		"cannot cog and say thou art this and that, like a\n"+
		"many of these lisping hawthorn-buds, that come like\n"+
		"women in men's apparel, and smell like Bucklersbury\n"+
		"in simple time; I cannot: but I love thee; none\n"+
		"but thee; and thou deservest it.\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"Do not betray me, sir. I fear you love Mistress Page.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Thou mightst as well say I love to walk by the\n"+
		"Counter-gate, which is as hateful to me as the reek\n"+
		"of a lime-kiln.\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"Well, heaven knows how I love you; and you shall one\n"+
		"day find it.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Keep in that mind; I'll deserve it.\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"Nay, I must tell you, so you do; or else I could not\n"+
		"be in that mind.\n"+
		"ROBIN\n"+
		"[Within] Mistress Ford, Mistress Ford! here's\n"+
		"Mistress Page at the door, sweating and blowing and\n"+
		"looking wildly, and would needs speak with you presently.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"She shall not see me: I will ensconce me behind the arras.\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"Pray you, do so: she's a very tattling woman.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF hides himself\n"+
		"Re-enter MISTRESS PAGE and ROBIN\n"+
		"What's the matter? how now!\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"O Mistress Ford, what have you done? You're shamed,\n"+

		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"What's the matter, good Mistress Page?\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"O well-a-day, Mistress Ford! having an honest man\n"+
		"to your husband, to give him such cause of suspicion!\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"What cause of suspicion?\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"What cause of suspicion! Out pon you! how am I\n"+
		"mistook in you!\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"Why, alas, what's the matter?\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"Your husband's coming hither, woman, with all the\n"+
		"officers in Windsor, to search for a gentleman that\n"+
		"he says is here now in the house by your consent, to\n"+
		"take an ill advantage of his assence: you are undone.\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"'Tis not so, I hope.\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"Pray heaven it be not so, that you have such a man\n"+
		"here! but 'tis most certain your husband's coming,\n"+
		"with half Windsor at his heels, to search for such a\n"+
		"one. I come before to tell you. If you know\n"+
		"yourself clear, why, I am glad of it; but if you\n"+
		"have a friend here convey, convey him out. Be not\n"+
		"amazed; call all your senses to you; defend your\n"+
		"reputation, or bid farewell to your good life for ever.\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"What shall I do? There is a gentleman my dear\n"+
		"friend; and I fear not mine own shame so much as his\n"+
		"peril: I had rather than a thousand pound he were\n"+
		"out of the house.\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"For shame! never stand 'you had rather' and 'you\n"+
		"had rather:' your husband's here at hand, bethink\n"+
		"you of some conveyance: in the house you cannot\n"+
		"hide him. O, how have you deceived me! Look, here\n"+
		"is a basket: if he be of any reasonable stature, he\n"+
		"may creep in here; and throw foul linen upon him, as\n"+
		"if it were going to bucking: or--it is whiting-time\n"+
		"--send him by your two men to Datchet-mead.\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"He's too big to go in there. What shall I do?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"[Coming forward] Let me see't, let me see't, O, let\n"+
		"me see't! I'll in, I'll in. Follow your friend's\n"+
		"counsel. I'll in.\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"What, Sir John Falstaff! Are these your letters, knight?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+

		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"What a taking was he in when your husband asked who\n"+

		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"I am half afraid he will have need of washing; so\n"+

		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"I think my husband hath some special suspicion of\n"+

		"in his jealousy till now.\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"I will lay a plot to try that; and we will yet have\n"+

		"Why, thou must be thyself.\n"+
		"He doth object I am too great of birth--,\n"+

		"I seek to heal it only by his wealth:\n"+
		"Besides these, other bars he lays before me,\n"+

		"May be he tells you true.\n"+
		"FENTON\n"+
		"No, heaven so speed me in my time to come!\n"+
		"Albeit I will confess thy father's wealth\n"+
		"Was the first motive that I woo'd thee, Anne:\n"+
		"Yet, wooing thee, I found thee of more value\n"+

		"ANNE PAGE\n"+
		"I mean, Master Slender, what would you with me?\n"+
		"SLENDER\n"+
		"Truly, for mine own part, I would little or nothing\n"+

		"A kind heart he hath: a woman would run through\n"+

		"Master Slender had her; or, in sooth, I would Master\n"+
		"Fenton had her; I will do what I can for them all\n"+
		"three; for so I have promised, and I'll be as good\n"+
		"as my word; but speciously for Master Fenton. Well,\n"+
		"I must of another errand to Sir John Falstaff from\n"+

		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE V. A room in the Garter Inn.\n"+
		"Enter FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Bardolph, I say,--\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Here, sir.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Go fetch me a quart of sack; put a toast in't.\n"+
		"Exit BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Have I lived to be carried in a basket, like a\n"+
		"barrow of butcher's offal, and to be thrown in the\n"+
		"Thames? Well, if I be served such another trick,\n"+
		"I'll have my brains ta'en out and buttered, and give\n"+
		"them to a dog for a new-year's gift. The rogues\n"+
		"slighted me into the river with as little remorse as\n"+
		"they would have drowned a blind bitch's puppies,\n"+
		"fifteen i' the litter: and you may know by my size\n"+
		"that I have a kind of alacrity in sinking; if the\n"+
		"bottom were as deep as hell, I should down. I had\n"+
		"been drowned, but that the shore was shelvy and\n"+
		"shallow,--a death that I abhor; for the water swells\n"+
		"a man; and what a thing should I have been when I\n"+
		"had been swelled! I should have been a mountain of mummy.\n"+
		"Re-enter BARDOLPH with sack\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Here's Mistress Quickly, sir, to speak with you.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Let me pour in some sack to the Thames water; for my\n"+
		"belly's as cold as if I had swallowed snowballs for\n"+
		"pills to cool the reins. Call her in.\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Come in, woman!\n"+
		"Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"By your leave; I cry you mercy: give your worship\n"+
		"good morrow.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Take away these chalices. Go brew me a pottle of\n"+
		"sack finely.\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"With eggs, sir?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Simple of itself; I'll no pullet-sperm in my brewage.\n"+
		"Exit BARDOLPH\n"+
		"How now!\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"Marry, sir, I come to your worship from Mistress Ford.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Mistress Ford! I have had ford enough; I was thrown\n"+
		"into the ford; I have my belly full of ford.\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"Alas the day! good heart, that was not her fault:\n"+
		"she does so take on with her men; they mistook their erection.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"So did I mine, to build upon a foolish woman's promise.\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"Well, she laments, sir, for it, that it would yearn\n"+
		"your heart to see it. Her husband goes this morning\n"+
		"a-birding; she desires you once more to come to her\n"+
		"between eight and nine: I must carry her word\n"+
		"quickly: she'll make you amends, I warrant you.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Well, I will visit her: tell her so; and bid her\n"+
		"think what a man is: let her consider his frailty,\n"+
		"and then judge of my merit.\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"I will tell her.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Do so. Between nine and ten, sayest thou?\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"Eight and nine, sir.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Well, be gone: I will not miss her.\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"Peace be with you, sir.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"I marvel I hear not of Master Brook; he sent me word\n"+
		"to stay within: I like his money well. O, here he comes.\n"+
		"Enter FORD\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"Bless you, sir!\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Now, master Brook, you come to know what hath passed\n"+
		"between me and Ford's wife?\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"That, indeed, Sir John, is my business.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Master Brook, I will not lie to you: I was at her\n"+
		"house the hour she appointed me.\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"And sped you, sir?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"How so, sir? Did she change her determination?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"No, Master Brook; but the peaking Cornuto her\n"+
		"husband, Master Brook, dwelling in a continual\n"+
		"'larum of jealousy, comes me in the instant of our\n"+
		"encounter, after we had embraced, kissed, protested,\n"+
		"and, as it were, spoke the prologue of our comedy;\n"+
		"and at his heels a rabble of his companions, thither\n"+
		"provoked and instigated by his distemper, and,\n"+
		"forsooth, to search his house for his wife's love.\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"What, while you were there?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"While I was there.\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"And did he search for you, and could not find you?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"You shall hear. As good luck would have it, comes\n"+
		"in one Mistress Page; gives intelligence of Ford's\n"+
		"approach; and, in her invention and Ford's wife's\n"+
		"distraction, they conveyed me into a buck-basket.\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"A buck-basket!\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"By the Lord, a buck-basket! rammed me in with foul\n"+
		"shirts and smocks, socks, foul stockings, greasy\n"+
		"napkins; that, Master Brook, there was the rankest\n"+
		"compound of villanous smell that ever offended nostril.\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"And how long lay you there?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Nay, you shall hear, Master Brook, what I have\n"+
		"suffered to bring this woman to evil for your good.\n"+
		"Being thus crammed in the basket, a couple of Ford's\n"+
		"knaves, his hinds, were called forth by their\n"+
		"mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to\n"+
		"Datchet-lane: they took me on their shoulders; met\n"+
		"the jealous knave their master in the door, who\n"+
		"asked them once or twice what they had in their\n"+
		"basket: I quaked for fear, lest the lunatic knave\n"+
		"would have searched it; but fate, ordaining he\n"+
		"should be a cuckold, held his hand. Well: on went he\n"+
		"for a search, and away went I for foul clothes. But\n"+
		"mark the sequel, Master Brook: I suffered the pangs\n"+
		"of three several deaths; first, an intolerable\n"+
		"fright, to be detected with a jealous rotten\n"+
		"bell-wether; next, to be compassed, like a good\n"+
		"bilbo, in the circumference of a peck, hilt to\n"+
		"point, heel to head; and then, to be stopped in,\n"+
		"like a strong distillation, with stinking clothes\n"+
		"that fretted in their own grease: think of that,--a\n"+
		"man of my kidney,--think of that,--that am as subject\n"+
		"to heat as butter; a man of continual dissolution\n"+
		"and thaw: it was a miracle to scape suffocation.\n"+
		"And in the height of this bath, when I was more than\n"+
		"half stewed in grease, like a Dutch dish, to be\n"+
		"thrown into the Thames, and cooled, glowing hot,\n"+
		"in that surge, like a horse-shoe; think of\n"+
		"that,--hissing hot,--think of that, Master Brook.\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"In good sadness, I am sorry that for my sake you\n"+
		"have sufferd all this. My suit then is desperate;\n"+
		"you'll undertake her no more?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Master Brook, I will be thrown into Etna, as I have\n"+
		"been into Thames, ere I will leave her thus. Her\n"+
		"husband is this morning gone a-birding: I have\n"+
		"received from her another embassy of meeting; 'twixt\n"+
		"eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"'Tis past eight already, sir.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Is it? I will then address me to my appointment.\n"+
		"Come to me at your convenient leisure, and you shall\n"+
		"know how I speed; and the conclusion shall be\n"+
		"crowned with your enjoying her. Adieu. You shall\n"+
		"have her, Master Brook; Master Brook, you shall\n"+
		"cuckold Ford.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"Hum! ha! is this a vision? is this a dream? do I\n"+
		"sleep? Master Ford awake! awake, Master Ford!\n"+
		"there's a hole made in your best coat, Master Ford.\n"+
		"This 'tis to be married! this 'tis to have linen\n"+
		"and buck-baskets! Well, I will proclaim myself\n"+
		"what I am: I will now take the lecher; he is at my\n"+
		"house; he cannot 'scape me; 'tis impossible he\n"+
		"should; he cannot creep into a halfpenny purse,\n"+
		"nor into a pepper-box: but, lest the devil that\n"+
		"guides him should aid him, I will search\n"+
		"impossible places. Though what I am I cannot avoid,\n"+
		"yet to be what I would not shall not make me tame:\n"+
		"if I have horns to make one mad, let the proverb go\n"+
		"with me: I'll be horn-mad.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"ACT IV\n"+
		"SCENE I. A street.\n"+

		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"Is he at Master Ford's already, think'st thou?\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"Sure he is by this, or will be presently: but,\n"+
		"truly, he is very courageous mad about his throwing\n"+
		"into the water. Mistress Ford desires you to come suddenly.\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"I'll be with her by and by; I'll but bring my young\n"+
		"man here to school. Look, where his master comes;\n"+
		"'tis a playing-day, I see.\n"+

		"William, how many numbers is in nouns?\n"+
		"WILLIAM PAGE\n"+
		"Two.\n"+

		"Show me now, William, some declensions of your pronouns.\n"+
		"WILLIAM PAGE\n"+
		"Forsooth, I have forgot.\n"+
		"SIR HUGH EVANS\n"+
		"It is qui, quae, quod: if you forget your 'quies,'\n"+
		"your 'quaes,' and your 'quods,' you must be\n"+
		"preeches. Go your ways, and play; go.\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"He is a better scholar than I thought he was.\n"+
		"SIR HUGH EVANS\n"+
		"He is a good sprag memory. Farewell, Mistress Page.\n"+

		"SCENE II. A room in FORD'S house.\n"+
		"Enter FALSTAFF and MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Mistress Ford, your sorrow hath eaten up my\n"+
		"sufferance. I see you are obsequious in your love,\n"+
		"and I profess requital to a hair's breadth; not\n"+
		"only, Mistress Ford, in the simple\n"+
		"office of love, but in all the accoutrement,\n"+
		"complement and ceremony of it. But are you\n"+
		"sure of your husband now?\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"He's a-birding, sweet Sir John.\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"[Within] What, ho, gossip Ford! what, ho!\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"Step into the chamber, Sir John.\n"+
		"Exit FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Enter MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"How now, sweetheart! who's at home besides yourself?\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"Why, none but mine own people.\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"Indeed!\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"No, certainly.\n"+
		"Aside to her\n"+
		"Speak louder.\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"Truly, I am so glad you have nobody here.\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"Why?\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"Why, woman, your husband is in his old lunes again:\n"+
		"he so takes on yonder with my husband; so rails\n"+
		"against all married mankind; so curses all Eve's\n"+
		"daughters, of what complexion soever; and so buffets\n"+
		"himself on the forehead, crying, 'Peer out, peer\n"+
		"out!' that any madness I ever yet beheld seemed but\n"+
		"tameness, civility and patience, to this his\n"+
		"distemper he is in now: I am glad the fat knight is not here.\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"Why, does he talk of him?\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"Of none but him; and swears he was carried out, the\n"+
		"last time he searched for him, in a basket; protests\n"+
		"to my husband he is now here, and hath drawn him and\n"+
		"the rest of their company from their sport, to make\n"+
		"another experiment of his suspicion: but I am glad\n"+
		"the knight is not here; now he shall see his own foolery.\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"How near is he, Mistress Page?\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"Hard by; at street end; he will be here anon.\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"I am undone! The knight is here.\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"Why then you are utterly shamed, and he's but a dead\n"+
		"man. What a woman are you!--Away with him, away\n"+
		"with him! better shame than murder.\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"Which way should be go? how should I bestow him?\n"+
		"Shall I put him into the basket again?\n"+
		"Re-enter FALSTAFF\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"No, I'll come no more i' the basket. May I not go\n"+
		"out ere he come?\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"Alas, three of Master Ford's brothers watch the door\n"+
		"with pistols, that none shall issue out; otherwise\n"+
		"you might slip away ere he came. But what make you here?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"What shall I do? I'll creep up into the chimney.\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"There they always use to discharge their\n"+
		"birding-pieces. Creep into the kiln-hole.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Where is it?\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"He will seek there, on my word. Neither press,\n"+
		"coffer, chest, trunk, well, vault, but he hath an\n"+
		"abstract for the remembrance of such places, and\n"+
		"goes to them by his note: there is no hiding you in the house.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"I'll go out then.\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"If you go out in your own semblance, you die, Sir\n"+
		"John. Unless you go out disguised--\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"How might we disguise him?\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"Alas the day, I know not! There is no woman's gown\n"+
		"big enough for him otherwise he might put on a hat,\n"+
		"a muffler and a kerchief, and so escape.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Good hearts, devise something: any extremity rather\n"+
		"than a mischief.\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"My maid's aunt, the fat woman of Brentford, has a\n"+
		"gown above.\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"On my word, it will serve him; she's as big as he\n"+
		"is: and there's her thrummed hat and her muffler\n"+
		"too. Run up, Sir John.\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"Go, go, sweet Sir John: Mistress Page and I will\n"+
		"look some linen for your head.\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"Quick, quick! we'll come dress you straight: put\n"+
		"on the gown the while.\n"+
		"Exit FALSTAFF\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"I would my husband would meet him in this shape: he\n"+
		"cannot abide the old woman of Brentford; he swears\n"+
		"she's a witch; forbade her my house and hath\n"+
		"threatened to beat her.\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"Heaven guide him to thy husband's cudgel, and the\n"+
		"devil guide his cudgel afterwards!\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"But is my husband coming?\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"Ah, in good sadness, is he; and talks of the basket\n"+
		"too, howsoever he hath had intelligence.\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"We'll try that; for I'll appoint my men to carry the\n"+
		"basket again, to meet him at the door with it, as\n"+
		"they did last time.\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"Nay, but he'll be here presently: let's go dress him\n"+
		"like the witch of Brentford.\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"I'll first direct my men what they shall do with the\n"+
		"basket. Go up; I'll bring linen for him straight.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"Hang him, dishonest varlet! we cannot misuse him enough.\n"+
		"We'll leave a proof, by that which we will do,\n"+
		"Wives may be merry, and yet honest too:\n"+
		"We do not act that often jest and laugh;\n"+
		"'Tis old, but true, Still swine eat all the draff.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"Re-enter MISTRESS FORD with two Servants\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"Go, sirs, take the basket again on your shoulders:\n"+
		"your master is hard at door; if he bid you set it\n"+
		"down, obey him: quickly, dispatch.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"First Servant\n"+
		"Come, come, take it up.\n"+
		"Second Servant\n"+
		"Pray heaven it be not full of knight again.\n"+
		"First Servant\n"+
		"I hope not; I had as lief bear so much lead.\n"+
		"Enter FORD, PAGE, SHALLOW, DOCTOR CAIUS, and SIR HUGH EVANS\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"Ay, but if it prove true, Master Page, have you any\n"+
		"way then to unfool me again? Set down the basket,\n"+
		"villain! Somebody call my wife. Youth in a basket!\n"+
		"O you panderly rascals! there's a knot, a ging, a\n"+
		"pack, a conspiracy against me: now shall the devil\n"+
		"be shamed. What, wife, I say! Come, come forth!\n"+
		"Behold what honest clothes you send forth to bleaching!\n"+
		"PAGE\n"+
		"Why, this passes, Master Ford; you are not to go\n"+
		"loose any longer; you must be pinioned.\n"+
		"SIR HUGH EVANS\n"+
		"Why, this is lunatics! this is mad as a mad dog!\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"Indeed, Master Ford, this is not well, indeed.\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"So say I too, sir.\n"+
		"Re-enter MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"Come hither, Mistress Ford; Mistress Ford the honest\n"+
		"woman, the modest wife, the virtuous creature, that\n"+
		"hath the jealous fool to her husband! I suspect\n"+
		"without cause, mistress, do I?\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"Heaven be my witness you do, if you suspect me in\n"+
		"any dishonesty.\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"Well said, brazen-face! hold it out. Come forth, sirrah!\n"+
		"Pulling clothes out of the basket\n"+
		"PAGE\n"+
		"This passes!\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"Are you not ashamed? let the clothes alone.\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"I shall find you anon.\n"+
		"SIR HUGH EVANS\n"+
		"'Tis unreasonable! Will you take up your wife's\n"+
		"clothes? Come away.\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"Empty the basket, I say!\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"Why, man, why?\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"Master Page, as I am a man, there was one conveyed\n"+
		"out of my house yesterday in this basket: why may\n"+
		"not he be there again? In my house I am sure he is:\n"+
		"my intelligence is true; my jealousy is reasonable.\n"+
		"Pluck me out all the linen.\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"If you find a man there, he shall die a flea's death.\n"+
		"PAGE\n"+
		"Here's no man.\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"By my fidelity, this is not well, Master Ford; this\n"+
		"wrongs you.\n"+
		"SIR HUGH EVANS\n"+
		"Master Ford, you must pray, and not follow the\n"+
		"imaginations of your own heart: this is jealousies.\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"Well, he's not here I seek for.\n"+
		"PAGE\n"+
		"No, nor nowhere else but in your brain.\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"Help to search my house this one time. If I find\n"+
		"not what I seek, show no colour for my extremity; let\n"+
		"me for ever be your table-sport; let them say of\n"+
		"me, 'As jealous as Ford, Chat searched a hollow\n"+
		"walnut for his wife's leman.' Satisfy me once more;\n"+
		"once more search with me.\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"What, ho, Mistress Page! come you and the old woman\n"+
		"down; my husband will come into the chamber.\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"Old woman! what old woman's that?\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"Nay, it is my maid's aunt of Brentford.\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"A witch, a quean, an old cozening quean! Have I not\n"+
		"forbid her my house? She comes of errands, does\n"+
		"she? We are simple men; we do not know what's\n"+
		"brought to pass under the profession of\n"+
		"fortune-telling. She works by charms, by spells,\n"+
		"by the figure, and such daubery as this is, beyond\n"+
		"our element we know nothing. Come down, you witch,\n"+
		"you hag, you; come down, I say!\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"Nay, good, sweet husband! Good gentlemen, let him\n"+

		"Come, Mother Prat; come, give me your hand.\n"+
		"FORD\n"+

		"Exit FALSTAFF\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"Are you not ashamed? I think you have killed the\n"+
		"poor woman.\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"Nay, he will do it. 'Tis a goodly credit for you.\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"Hang her, witch!\n"+
		"SIR HUGH EVANS\n"+
		"By the yea and no, I think the 'oman is a witch\n"+
		"indeed: I like not when a 'oman has a great peard;\n"+
		"I spy a great peard under his muffler.\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"Will you follow, gentlemen? I beseech you, follow;\n"+
		"see but the issue of my jealousy: if I cry out thus\n"+
		"upon no trail, never trust me when I open again.\n"+
		"PAGE\n"+
		"Let's obey his humour a little further: come,\n"+
		"gentlemen.\n"+
		"Exeunt FORD, PAGE, SHALLOW, DOCTOR CAIUS, and SIR HUGH EVANS\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"Trust me, he beat him most pitifully.\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"Nay, by the mass, that he did not; he beat him most\n"+
		"unpitifully, methought.\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"I'll have the cudgel hallowed and hung o'er the\n"+
		"altar; it hath done meritorious service.\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"What think you? may we, with the warrant of\n"+
		"womanhood and the witness of a good conscience,\n"+
		"pursue him with any further revenge?\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"The spirit of wantonness is, sure, scared out of\n"+
		"him: if the devil have him not in fee-simple, with\n"+
		"fine and recovery, he will never, I think, in the\n"+
		"way of waste, attempt us again.\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"Shall we tell our husbands how we have served him?\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"Yes, by all means; if it be but to scrape the\n"+
		"figures out of your husband's brains. If they can\n"+
		"find in their hearts the poor unvirtuous fat knight\n"+
		"shall be any further afflicted, we two will still be\n"+
		"the ministers.\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"I'll warrant they'll have him publicly shamed: and\n"+
		"methinks there would be no period to the jest,\n"+
		"should he not be publicly shamed.\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"Come, to the forge with it then; shape it: I would\n"+
		"not have things cool.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+

		"Host\n"+
		"What duke should that be comes so secretly? I hear\n"+
		"not of him in the court. Let me speak with the\n"+

		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Ay, sir; I'll call them to you.\n"+
		"Host\n"+
		"They shall have my horses; but I'll make them pay;\n"+
		"I'll sauce them: they have had my house a week at\n"+
		"command; I have turned away my other guests: they\n"+
		"must come off; I'll sauce them. Come.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV. A room in FORD'S house.\n"+
		"Enter PAGE, FORD, MISTRESS PAGE, MISTRESS FORD, and SIR HUGH EVANS\n"+
		"SIR HUGH EVANS\n"+
		"'Tis one of the best discretions of a 'oman as ever\n"+
		"I did look upon.\n"+
		"PAGE\n"+
		"And did he send you both these letters at an instant?\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"Within a quarter of an hour.\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"Pardon me, wife. Henceforth do what thou wilt;\n"+
		"I rather will suspect the sun with cold\n"+
		"Than thee with wantonness: now doth thy honour stand\n"+
		"In him that was of late an heretic,\n"+
		"As firm as faith.\n"+
		"PAGE\n"+
		"'Tis well, 'tis well; no more:\n"+
		"Be not as extreme in submission\n"+
		"As in offence.\n"+
		"But let our plot go forward: let our wives\n"+
		"Yet once again, to make us public sport,\n"+
		"Appoint a meeting with this old fat fellow,\n"+
		"Where we may take him and disgrace him for it.\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"There is no better way than that they spoke of.\n"+
		"PAGE\n"+
		"How? to send him word they'll meet him in the park\n"+
		"at midnight? Fie, fie! he'll never come.\n"+
		"SIR HUGH EVANS\n"+
		"You say he has been thrown in the rivers and has\n"+
		"been grievously peaten as an old 'oman: methinks\n"+
		"there should be terrors in him that he should not\n"+
		"come; methinks his flesh is punished, he shall have\n"+
		"no desires.\n"+
		"PAGE\n"+
		"So think I too.\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"Devise but how you'll use him when he comes,\n"+
		"And let us two devise to bring him thither.\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"There is an old tale goes that Herne the hunter,\n"+
		"Sometime a keeper here in Windsor forest,\n"+
		"Doth all the winter-time, at still midnight,\n"+
		"Walk round about an oak, with great ragg'd horns;\n"+
		"And there he blasts the tree and takes the cattle\n"+
		"And makes milch-kine yield blood and shakes a chain\n"+
		"In a most hideous and dreadful manner:\n"+
		"You have heard of such a spirit, and well you know\n"+
		"The superstitious idle-headed eld\n"+
		"Received and did deliver to our age\n"+
		"This tale of Herne the hunter for a truth.\n"+
		"PAGE\n"+
		"Why, yet there want not many that do fear\n"+
		"In deep of night to walk by this Herne's oak:\n"+
		"But what of this?\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"Marry, this is our device;\n"+
		"That Falstaff at that oak shall meet with us.\n"+
		"PAGE\n"+
		"Well, let it not be doubted but he'll come:\n"+
		"And in this shape when you have brought him thither,\n"+
		"What shall be done with him? what is your plot?\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"That likewise have we thought upon, and thus:\n"+
		"Nan Page my daughter and my little son\n"+
		"And three or four more of their growth we'll dress\n"+
		"Like urchins, ouphes and fairies, green and white,\n"+
		"With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads,\n"+
		"And rattles in their hands: upon a sudden,\n"+
		"As Falstaff, she and I, are newly met,\n"+
		"Let them from forth a sawpit rush at once\n"+
		"With some diffused song: upon their sight,\n"+
		"We two in great amazedness will fly:\n"+
		"Then let them all encircle him about\n"+
		"And, fairy-like, to-pinch the unclean knight,\n"+
		"And ask him why, that hour of fairy revel,\n"+
		"In their so sacred paths he dares to tread\n"+
		"In shape profane.\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"And till he tell the truth,\n"+
		"Let the supposed fairies pinch him sound\n"+
		"And burn him with their tapers.\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"The truth being known,\n"+
		"We'll all present ourselves, dis-horn the spirit,\n"+
		"And mock him home to Windsor.\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"The children must\n"+
		"Be practised well to this, or they'll ne'er do't.\n"+
		"SIR HUGH EVANS\n"+
		"I will teach the children their behaviors; and I\n"+
		"will be like a jack-an-apes also, to burn the\n"+
		"knight with my taber.\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"That will be excellent. I'll go and buy them vizards.\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"My Nan shall be the queen of all the fairies,\n"+
		"Finely attired in a robe of white.\n"+
		"PAGE\n"+
		"That silk will I go buy.\n"+
		"Aside\n"+
		"And in that time\n"+
		"Shall Master Slender steal my Nan away\n"+
		"And marry her at Eton. Go send to Falstaff straight.\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"Nay I'll to him again in name of Brook\n"+
		"He'll tell me all his purpose: sure, he'll come.\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"Fear not you that. Go get us properties\n"+
		"And tricking for our fairies.\n"+
		"SIR HUGH EVANS\n"+
		"Let us about it: it is admirable pleasures and fery\n"+
		"honest knaveries.\n"+
		"Exeunt PAGE, FORD, and SIR HUGH EVANS\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"Go, Mistress Ford,\n"+
		"Send quickly to Sir John, to know his mind.\n"+
		"Exit MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"I'll to the doctor: he hath my good will,\n"+
		"And none but he, to marry with Nan Page.\n"+
		"That Slender, though well landed, is an idiot;\n"+
		"And he my husband best of all affects.\n"+
		"The doctor is well money'd, and his friends\n"+
		"Potent at court: he, none but he, shall have her,\n"+
		"Though twenty thousand worthier come to crave her.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE V. A room in the Garter Inn.\n"+

		"Host\n"+
		"What wouldst thou have, boor? what: thick-skin?\n"+
		"speak, breathe, discuss; brief, short, quick, snap.\n"+

		"Ha! a fat woman! the knight may be robbed: I'll\n"+

		"[Above] How now, mine host!\n"+

		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"There was, mine host, an old fat woman even now with\n"+

		"Pray you, sir, was't not the wise woman of\n"+
		"Brentford?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Ay, marry, was it, mussel-shell: what would you with her?\n"+
		"SIMPLE\n"+
		"My master, sir, Master Slender, sent to her, seeing\n"+

		"Marry, she says that the very same man that\n"+
		"beguiled Master Slender of his chain cozened him of\n"+
		"it.\n"+
		"SIMPLE\n"+
		"I would I could have spoken with the woman herself;\n"+

		"Why, sir, they were nothing but about Mistress Anne\n"+

		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"'Tis, 'tis his fortune.\n"+
		"SIMPLE\n"+

		"Where be my horses? speak well of them, varletto.\n"+
		"BARDOLPH\n"+
		"Run away with the cozeners; for so soon as I came\n"+
		"beyond Eton, they threw me off from behind one of\n"+
		"them, in a slough of mire; and set spurs and away,\n"+
		"like three German devils, three Doctor Faustuses.\n"+
		"Host\n"+
		"They are gone but to meet the duke, villain: do not\n"+
		"say they be fled; Germans are honest men.\n"+
		"Enter SIR HUGH EVANS\n"+
		"SIR HUGH EVANS\n"+
		"Where is mine host?\n"+
		"Host\n"+
		"What is the matter, sir?\n"+
		"SIR HUGH EVANS\n"+
		"Have a care of your entertainments: there is a\n"+
		"friend of mine come to town tells me there is three\n"+
		"cozen-germans that has cozened all the hosts of\n"+
		"Readins, of Maidenhead, of Colebrook, of horses and\n"+
		"money. I tell you for good will, look you: you\n"+
		"are wise and full of gibes and vlouting-stocks, and\n"+
		"'tis not convenient you should be cozened. Fare you well.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"Enter DOCTOR CAIUS\n"+
		"DOCTOR CAIUS\n"+
		"Vere is mine host de Jarteer?\n"+
		"Host\n"+
		"Here, master doctor, in perplexity and doubtful dilemma.\n"+
		"DOCTOR CAIUS\n"+
		"I cannot tell vat is dat: but it is tell-a me dat\n"+
		"you make grand preparation for a duke de Jamany: by\n"+
		"my trot, dere is no duke dat the court is know to\n"+
		"come. I tell you for good vill: adieu.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"Host\n"+
		"Hue and cry, villain, go! Assist me, knight. I am\n"+
		"undone! Fly, run, hue and cry, villain! I am undone!\n"+
		"Exeunt Host and BARDOLPH\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"I would all the world might be cozened; for I have\n"+
		"been cozened and beaten too. If it should come to\n"+
		"the ear of the court, how I have been transformed\n"+
		"and how my transformation hath been washed and\n"+
		"cudgelled, they would melt me out of my fat drop by\n"+
		"drop and liquor fishermen's boots with me; I warrant\n"+
		"they would whip me with their fine wits till I were\n"+
		"as crest-fallen as a dried pear. I never prospered\n"+
		"since I forswore myself at primero. Well, if my\n"+
		"wind were but long enough to say my prayers, I would repent.\n"+
		"Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"Now, whence come you?\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"From the two parties, forsooth.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"The devil take one party and his dam the other! and\n"+
		"so they shall be both bestowed. I have suffered more\n"+
		"for their sakes, more than the villanous inconstancy\n"+
		"of man's disposition is able to bear.\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"And have not they suffered? Yes, I warrant;\n"+
		"speciously one of them; Mistress Ford, good heart,\n"+
		"is beaten black and blue, that you cannot see a\n"+
		"white spot about her.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"What tellest thou me of black and blue? I was\n"+
		"beaten myself into all the colours of the rainbow;\n"+
		"and I was like to be apprehended for the witch of\n"+
		"Brentford: but that my admirable dexterity of wit,\n"+
		"my counterfeiting the action of an old woman,\n"+
		"delivered me, the knave constable had set me i' the\n"+
		"stocks, i' the common stocks, for a witch.\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"Sir, let me speak with you in your chamber: you\n"+
		"shall hear how things go; and, I warrant, to your\n"+
		"content. Here is a letter will say somewhat. Good\n"+
		"hearts, what ado here is to bring you together!\n"+
		"Sure, one of you does not serve heaven well, that\n"+
		"you are so crossed.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Come up into my chamber.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE VI. Another room in the Garter Inn.\n"+
		"Enter FENTON and Host\n"+
		"Host\n"+
		"Master Fenton, talk not to me; my mind is heavy: I\n"+
		"will give over all.\n"+
		"FENTON\n"+
		"Yet hear me speak. Assist me in my purpose,\n"+
		"And, as I am a gentleman, I'll give thee\n"+
		"A hundred pound in gold more than your loss.\n"+
		"Host\n"+
		"I will hear you, Master Fenton; and I will at the\n"+
		"least keep your counsel.\n"+
		"FENTON\n"+
		"From time to time I have acquainted you\n"+
		"With the dear love I bear to fair Anne Page;\n"+
		"Who mutually hath answer'd my affection,\n"+
		"So far forth as herself might be her chooser,\n"+
		"Even to my wish: I have a letter from her\n"+
		"Of such contents as you will wonder at;\n"+
		"The mirth whereof so larded with my matter,\n"+
		"That neither singly can be manifested,\n"+
		"Without the show of both; fat Falstaff\n"+
		"Hath a great scene: the image of the jest\n"+
		"I'll show you here at large. Hark, good mine host.\n"+
		"To-night at Herne's oak, just 'twixt twelve and one,\n"+
		"Must my sweet Nan present the Fairy Queen;\n"+
		"The purpose why, is here: in which disguise,\n"+
		"While other jests are something rank on foot,\n"+
		"Her father hath commanded her to slip\n"+
		"Away with Slender and with him at Eton\n"+
		"Immediately to marry: she hath consented: Now, sir,\n"+
		"Her mother, ever strong against that match\n"+
		"And firm for Doctor Caius, hath appointed\n"+
		"That he shall likewise shuffle her away,\n"+
		"While other sports are tasking of their minds,\n"+
		"And at the deanery, where a priest attends,\n"+
		"Straight marry her: to this her mother's plot\n"+
		"She seemingly obedient likewise hath\n"+
		"Made promise to the doctor. Now, thus it rests:\n"+
		"Her father means she shall be all in white,\n"+
		"And in that habit, when Slender sees his time\n"+
		"To take her by the hand and bid her go,\n"+
		"She shall go with him: her mother hath intended,\n"+
		"The better to denote her to the doctor,\n"+
		"For they must all be mask'd and vizarded,\n"+
		"That quaint in green she shall be loose enrobed,\n"+
		"With ribands pendent, flaring 'bout her head;\n"+
		"And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe,\n"+
		"To pinch her by the hand, and, on that token,\n"+
		"The maid hath given consent to go with him.\n"+
		"Host\n"+
		"Which means she to deceive, father or mother?\n"+
		"FENTON\n"+
		"Both, my good host, to go along with me:\n"+
		"And here it rests, that you'll procure the vicar\n"+
		"To stay for me at church 'twixt twelve and one,\n"+
		"And, in the lawful name of marrying,\n"+
		"To give our hearts united ceremony.\n"+
		"Host\n"+
		"Well, husband your device; I'll to the vicar:\n"+
		"Bring you the maid, you shall not lack a priest.\n"+
		"FENTON\n"+
		"So shall I evermore be bound to thee;\n"+
		"Besides, I'll make a present recompense.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT V\n"+
		"SCENE I. A room in the Garter Inn.\n"+
		"Enter FALSTAFF and MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Prithee, no more prattling; go. I'll hold. This is\n"+
		"the third time; I hope good luck lies in odd\n"+
		"numbers. Away I go. They say there is divinity in\n"+
		"odd numbers, either in nativity, chance, or death. Away!\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"I'll provide you a chain; and I'll do what I can to\n"+
		"get you a pair of horns.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Away, I say; time wears: hold up your head, and mince.\n"+
		"Exit MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"Enter FORD\n"+
		"How now, Master Brook! Master Brook, the matter\n"+
		"will be known to-night, or never. Be you in the\n"+
		"Park about midnight, at Herne's oak, and you shall\n"+
		"see wonders.\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"Went you not to her yesterday, sir, as you told me\n"+
		"you had appointed?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"I went to her, Master Brook, as you see, like a poor\n"+
		"old man: but I came from her, Master Brook, like a\n"+
		"poor old woman. That same knave Ford, her husband,\n"+
		"hath the finest mad devil of jealousy in him,\n"+
		"Master Brook, that ever governed frenzy. I will tell\n"+
		"you: he beat me grievously, in the shape of a\n"+
		"woman; for in the shape of man, Master Brook, I fear\n"+
		"not Goliath with a weaver's beam; because I know\n"+
		"also life is a shuttle. I am in haste; go along\n"+
		"with me: I'll tell you all, Master Brook. Since I\n"+
		"plucked geese, played truant and whipped top, I knew\n"+
		"not what 'twas to be beaten till lately. Follow\n"+
		"me: I'll tell you strange things of this knave\n"+
		"Ford, on whom to-night I will be revenged, and I\n"+
		"will deliver his wife into your hand. Follow.\n"+
		"Strange things in hand, Master Brook! Follow.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. Windsor Park.\n"+
		"Enter PAGE, SHALLOW, and SLENDER\n"+
		"PAGE\n"+
		"Come, come; we'll couch i' the castle-ditch till we\n"+
		"see the light of our fairies. Remember, son Slender,\n"+
		"my daughter.\n"+
		"SLENDER\n"+
		"Ay, forsooth; I have spoke with her and we have a\n"+
		"nay-word how to know one another: I come to her in\n"+
		"white, and cry 'mum;' she cries 'budget;' and by\n"+
		"that we know one another.\n"+
		"SHALLOW\n"+
		"That's good too: but what needs either your 'mum'\n"+
		"or her 'budget?' the white will decipher her well\n"+
		"enough. It hath struck ten o'clock.\n"+
		"PAGE\n"+
		"The night is dark; light and spirits will become it\n"+
		"well. Heaven prosper our sport! No man means evil\n"+
		"but the devil, and we shall know him by his horns.\n"+
		"Let's away; follow me.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. A street leading to the Park.\n"+
		"Enter MISTRESS PAGE, MISTRESS FORD, and DOCTOR CAIUS\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"Master doctor, my daughter is in green: when you\n"+
		"see your time, take her by the band, away with her\n"+
		"to the deanery, and dispatch it quickly. Go before\n"+
		"into the Park: we two must go together.\n"+
		"DOCTOR CAIUS\n"+
		"I know vat I have to do. Adieu.\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"Fare you well, sir.\n"+
		"Exit DOCTOR CAIUS\n"+
		"My husband will not rejoice so much at the abuse of\n"+
		"Falstaff as he will chafe at the doctor's marrying\n"+
		"my daughter: but 'tis no matter; better a little\n"+
		"chiding than a great deal of heart-break.\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"Where is Nan now and her troop of fairies, and the\n"+
		"Welsh devil Hugh?\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"They are all couched in a pit hard by Herne's oak,\n"+
		"with obscured lights; which, at the very instant of\n"+
		"Falstaff's and our meeting, they will at once\n"+
		"display to the night.\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"That cannot choose but amaze him.\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"If he be not amazed, he will be mocked; if he be\n"+
		"amazed, he will every way be mocked.\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"We'll betray him finely.\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"Against such lewdsters and their lechery\n"+
		"Those that betray them do no treachery.\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"The hour draws on. To the oak, to the oak!\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV. Windsor Park.\n"+
		"Enter SIR HUGH EVANS, disguised, with others as Fairies\n"+
		"SIR HUGH EVANS\n"+
		"Trib, trib, fairies; come; and remember your parts:\n"+

		"when I give the watch-'ords, do as I pid you:\n"+
		"come, come; trib, trib.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE V. Another part of the Park.\n"+
		"Enter FALSTAFF disguised as Herne\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"The Windsor bell hath struck twelve; the minute\n"+
		"draws on. Now, the hot-blooded gods assist me!\n"+
		"Remember, Jove, thou wast a bull for thy Europa; love\n"+
		"set on thy horns. O powerful love! that, in some\n"+
		"respects, makes a beast a man, in some other, a man\n"+
		"a beast. You were also, Jupiter, a swan for the love\n"+
		"of Leda. O omnipotent Love! how near the god drew\n"+
		"to the complexion of a goose! A fault done first in\n"+
		"the form of a beast. O Jove, a beastly fault! And\n"+
		"then another fault in the semblance of a fowl; think\n"+
		"on 't, Jove; a foul fault! When gods have hot\n"+
		"backs, what shall poor men do? For me, I am here a\n"+
		"Windsor stag; and the fattest, I think, i' the\n"+
		"forest. Send me a cool rut-time, Jove, or who can\n"+
		"blame me to piss my tallow? Who comes here? my\n"+
		"doe?\n"+
		"Enter MISTRESS FORD and MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"Sir John! art thou there, my deer? my male deer?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"My doe with the black scut! Let the sky rain\n"+
		"potatoes; let it thunder to the tune of Green\n"+
		"Sleeves, hail kissing-comfits and snow eringoes; let\n"+
		"there come a tempest of provocation, I will shelter me here.\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"Mistress Page is come with me, sweetheart.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Divide me like a bribe buck, each a haunch: I will\n"+
		"keep my sides to myself, my shoulders for the fellow\n"+
		"of this walk, and my horns I bequeath your husbands.\n"+
		"Am I a woodman, ha? Speak I like Herne the hunter?\n"+
		"Why, now is Cupid a child of conscience; he makes\n"+
		"restitution. As I am a true spirit, welcome!\n"+
		"Noise within\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"Alas, what noise?\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"Heaven forgive our sins\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"What should this be?\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"Away, away!\n"+
		"They run off\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"I think the devil will not have me damned, lest the\n"+
		"oil that's in me should set hell on fire; he would\n"+
		"never else cross me thus.\n"+
		"Enter SIR HUGH EVANS, disguised as before; PISTOL, as Hobgoblin; MISTRESS QUICKLY, ANNE PAGE, and others, as Fairies, with tapers\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"Fairies, black, grey, green, and white,\n"+
		"You moonshine revellers and shades of night,\n"+
		"You orphan heirs of fixed destiny,\n"+
		"Attend your office and your quality.\n"+
		"Crier Hobgoblin, make the fairy oyes.\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.\n"+
		"Cricket, to Windsor chimneys shalt thou leap:\n"+
		"Where fires thou find'st unraked and hearths unswept,\n"+
		"There pinch the maids as blue as bilberry:\n"+
		"Our radiant queen hates sluts and sluttery.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"They are fairies; he that speaks to them shall die:\n"+
		"I'll wink and couch: no man their works must eye.\n"+
		"Lies down upon his face\n"+
		"SIR HUGH EVANS\n"+
		"Where's Bede? Go you, and where you find a maid\n"+
		"That, ere she sleep, has thrice her prayers said,\n"+
		"Raise up the organs of her fantasy;\n"+
		"Sleep she as sound as careless infancy:\n"+
		"But those as sleep and think not on their sins,\n"+
		"Pinch them, arms, legs, backs, shoulders, sides and shins.\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"About, about;\n"+
		"Search Windsor Castle, elves, within and out:\n"+
		"Strew good luck, ouphes, on every sacred room:\n"+
		"That it may stand till the perpetual doom,\n"+
		"In state as wholesome as in state 'tis fit,\n"+
		"Worthy the owner, and the owner it.\n"+
		"The several chairs of order look you scour\n"+
		"With juice of balm and every precious flower:\n"+
		"Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest,\n"+
		"With loyal blazon, evermore be blest!\n"+
		"And nightly, meadow-fairies, look you sing,\n"+
		"Like to the Garter's compass, in a ring:\n"+
		"The expressure that it bears, green let it be,\n"+
		"More fertile-fresh than all the field to see;\n"+
		"And 'Honi soit qui mal y pense' write\n"+
		"In emerald tufts, flowers purple, blue and white;\n"+
		"Let sapphire, pearl and rich embroidery,\n"+
		"Buckled below fair knighthood's bending knee:\n"+
		"Fairies use flowers for their charactery.\n"+
		"Away; disperse: but till 'tis one o'clock,\n"+
		"Our dance of custom round about the oak\n"+
		"Of Herne the hunter, let us not forget.\n"+
		"SIR HUGH EVANS\n"+
		"Pray you, lock hand in hand; yourselves in order set\n"+
		"And twenty glow-worms shall our lanterns be,\n"+
		"To guide our measure round about the tree.\n"+
		"But, stay; I smell a man of middle-earth.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Heavens defend me from that Welsh fairy, lest he\n"+
		"transform me to a piece of cheese!\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"Vile worm, thou wast o'erlook'd even in thy birth.\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"With trial-fire touch me his finger-end:\n"+
		"If he be chaste, the flame will back descend\n"+
		"And turn him to no pain; but if he start,\n"+
		"It is the flesh of a corrupted heart.\n"+
		"PISTOL\n"+
		"A trial, come.\n"+
		"SIR HUGH EVANS\n"+
		"Come, will this wood take fire?\n"+
		"They burn him with their tapers\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Oh, Oh, Oh!\n"+
		"MISTRESS QUICKLY\n"+
		"Corrupt, corrupt, and tainted in desire!\n"+
		"About him, fairies; sing a scornful rhyme;\n"+
		"And, as you trip, still pinch him to your time.\n"+
		"SONG.\n"+
		"Fie on sinful fantasy!\n"+
		"Fie on lust and luxury!\n"+
		"Lust is but a bloody fire,\n"+
		"Kindled with unchaste desire,\n"+
		"Fed in heart, whose flames aspire\n"+
		"As thoughts do blow them, higher and higher.\n"+
		"Pinch him, fairies, mutually;\n"+
		"Pinch him for his villany;\n"+
		"Pinch him, and burn him, and turn him about,\n"+
		"Till candles and starlight and moonshine be out.\n"+
		"During this song they pinch FALSTAFF. DOCTOR CAIUS comes one way, and steals away a boy in green; SLENDER another way, and takes off a boy in white; and FENTON comes and steals away ANN PAGE. A noise of hunting is heard within. All the Fairies run away. FALSTAFF pulls off his buck's head, and rises\n"+
		"Enter PAGE, FORD, MISTRESS PAGE, and MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"PAGE\n"+
		"Nay, do not fly; I think we have watch'd you now\n"+
		"Will none but Herne the hunter serve your turn?\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"I pray you, come, hold up the jest no higher\n"+
		"Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?\n"+
		"See you these, husband? do not these fair yokes\n"+
		"Become the forest better than the town?\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"Now, sir, who's a cuckold now? Master Brook,\n"+
		"Falstaff's a knave, a cuckoldly knave; here are his\n"+
		"horns, Master Brook: and, Master Brook, he hath\n"+
		"enjoyed nothing of Ford's but his buck-basket, his\n"+
		"cudgel, and twenty pounds of money, which must be\n"+
		"paid to Master Brook; his horses are arrested for\n"+
		"it, Master Brook.\n"+
		"MISTRESS FORD\n"+
		"Sir John, we have had ill luck; we could never meet.\n"+
		"I will never take you for my love again; but I will\n"+
		"always count you my deer.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass.\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"Ay, and an ox too: both the proofs are extant.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"And these are not fairies? I was three or four\n"+
		"times in the thought they were not fairies: and yet\n"+
		"the guiltiness of my mind, the sudden surprise of my\n"+
		"powers, drove the grossness of the foppery into a\n"+
		"received belief, in despite of the teeth of all\n"+
		"rhyme and reason, that they were fairies. See now\n"+
		"how wit may be made a Jack-a-Lent, when 'tis upon\n"+
		"ill employment!\n"+
		"SIR HUGH EVANS\n"+
		"Sir John Falstaff, serve Got, and leave your\n"+
		"desires, and fairies will not pinse you.\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"Well said, fairy Hugh.\n"+
		"SIR HUGH EVANS\n"+
		"And leave your jealousies too, I pray you.\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"I will never mistrust my wife again till thou art\n"+
		"able to woo her in good English.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Have I laid my brain in the sun and dried it, that\n"+
		"it wants matter to prevent so gross o'erreaching as\n"+
		"this? Am I ridden with a Welsh goat too? shall I\n"+
		"have a coxcomb of frize? 'Tis time I were choked\n"+
		"with a piece of toasted cheese.\n"+
		"SIR HUGH EVANS\n"+
		"Seese is not good to give putter; your belly is all putter.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"'Seese' and 'putter'! have I lived to stand at the\n"+
		"taunt of one that makes fritters of English? This\n"+
		"is enough to be the decay of lust and late-walking\n"+
		"through the realm.\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"Why Sir John, do you think, though we would have the\n"+
		"virtue out of our hearts by the head and shoulders\n"+
		"and have given ourselves without scruple to hell,\n"+
		"that ever the devil could have made you our delight?\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"What, a hodge-pudding? a bag of flax?\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"A puffed man?\n"+
		"PAGE\n"+
		"Old, cold, withered and of intolerable entrails?\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"And one that is as slanderous as Satan?\n"+
		"PAGE\n"+
		"And as poor as Job?\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"And as wicked as his wife?\n"+
		"SIR HUGH EVANS\n"+
		"And given to fornications, and to taverns and sack\n"+
		"and wine and metheglins, and to drinkings and\n"+
		"swearings and starings, pribbles and prabbles?\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"Well, I am your theme: you have the start of me; I\n"+
		"am dejected; I am not able to answer the Welsh\n"+
		"flannel; ignorance itself is a plummet o'er me: use\n"+

		"FORD\n"+
		"Marry, sir, we'll bring you to Windsor, to one\n"+
		"Master Brook, that you have cozened of money, to\n"+
		"whom you should have been a pander: over and above\n"+
		"that you have suffered, I think to repay that money\n"+
		"will be a biting affliction.\n"+
		"PAGE\n"+
		"Yet be cheerful, knight: thou shalt eat a posset\n"+
		"to-night at my house; where I will desire thee to\n"+
		"laugh at my wife, that now laughs at thee: tell her\n"+
		"Master Slender hath married her daughter.\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"[Aside] Doctors doubt that: if Anne Page be my\n"+

		"SLENDER\n"+
		"Whoa ho! ho, father Page!\n"+
		"PAGE\n"+
		"Son, how now! how now, son! have you dispatched?\n"+

		"PAGE\n"+
		"Of what, son?\n"+
		"SLENDER\n"+
		"I came yonder at Eton to marry Mistress Anne Page,\n"+
		"and she's a great lubberly boy. If it had not been\n"+
		"i' the church, I would have swinged him, or he\n"+
		"should have swinged me. If I did not think it had\n"+
		"been Anne Page, would I might never stir!--and 'tis\n"+
		"a postmaster's boy.\n"+
		"PAGE\n"+
		"Upon my life, then, you took the wrong.\n"+
		"SLENDER\n"+
		"What need you tell me that? I think so, when I took\n"+
		"a boy for a girl. If I had been married to him, for\n"+
		"all he was in woman's apparel, I would not have had\n"+
		"him.\n"+
		"PAGE\n"+
		"Why, this is your own folly. Did not I tell you how\n"+
		"you should know my daughter by her garments?\n"+
		"SLENDER\n"+
		"I went to her in white, and cried 'mum,' and she\n"+
		"cried 'budget,' as Anne and I had appointed; and yet\n"+
		"it was not Anne, but a postmaster's boy.\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"Good George, be not angry: I knew of your purpose;\n"+
		"turned my daughter into green; and, indeed, she is\n"+
		"now with the doctor at the deanery, and there married.\n"+
		"Enter DOCTOR CAIUS\n"+
		"DOCTOR CAIUS\n"+
		"Vere is Mistress Page? By gar, I am cozened: I ha'\n"+
		"married un garcon, a boy; un paysan, by gar, a boy;\n"+
		"it is not Anne Page: by gar, I am cozened.\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"Why, did you take her in green?\n"+
		"DOCTOR CAIUS\n"+
		"Ay, by gar, and 'tis a boy: by gar, I'll raise all Windsor.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"This is strange. Who hath got the right Anne?\n"+
		"PAGE\n"+
		"My heart misgives me: here comes Master Fenton.\n"+
		"Enter FENTON and ANNE PAGE\n"+
		"How now, Master Fenton!\n"+
		"ANNE PAGE\n"+
		"Pardon, good father! good my mother, pardon!\n"+
		"PAGE\n"+
		"Now, mistress, how chance you went not with Master Slender?\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"Why went you not with master doctor, maid?\n"+
		"FENTON\n"+
		"You do amaze her: hear the truth of it.\n"+
		"You would have married her most shamefully,\n"+
		"Where there was no proportion held in love.\n"+
		"The truth is, she and I, long since contracted,\n"+
		"Are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us.\n"+
		"The offence is holy that she hath committed;\n"+
		"And this deceit loses the name of craft,\n"+
		"Of disobedience, or unduteous title,\n"+
		"Since therein she doth evitate and shun\n"+
		"A thousand irreligious cursed hours,\n"+
		"Which forced marriage would have brought upon her.\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"Stand not amazed; here is no remedy:\n"+
		"In love the heavens themselves do guide the state;\n"+
		"Money buys lands, and wives are sold by fate.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"I am glad, though you have ta'en a special stand to\n"+
		"strike at me, that your arrow hath glanced.\n"+
		"PAGE\n"+
		"Well, what remedy? Fenton, heaven give thee joy!\n"+
		"What cannot be eschew'd must be embraced.\n"+
		"FALSTAFF\n"+
		"When night-dogs run, all sorts of deer are chased.\n"+
		"MISTRESS PAGE\n"+
		"Well, I will muse no further. Master Fenton,\n"+
		"Heaven give you many, many merry days!\n"+
		"Good husband, let us every one go home,\n"+
		"And laugh this sport o'er by a country fire;\n"+
		"Sir John and all.\n"+
		"FORD\n"+
		"Let it be so. Sir John,\n"+
		"To Master Brook you yet shall hold your word\n"+
		"For he tonight shall lie with Mistress Ford.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"
