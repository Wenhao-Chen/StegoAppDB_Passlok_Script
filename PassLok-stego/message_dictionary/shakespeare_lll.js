		"Loves Labours Lost\n"+
		"ACT I\n"+
		"SCENE I. The king of Navarre's park.\n"+
		"Enter FERDINAND king of Navarre, BIRON, LONGAVILLE and DUMAIN\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives,\n"+
		"Live register'd upon our brazen tombs\n"+
		"And then grace us in the disgrace of death;\n"+
		"When, spite of cormorant devouring Time,\n"+
		"The endeavor of this present breath may buy\n"+
		"That honour which shall bate his scythe's keen edge\n"+
		"And make us heirs of all eternity.\n"+
		"Therefore, brave conquerors,--for so you are,\n"+
		"That war against your own affections\n"+
		"And the huge army of the world's desires,--\n"+
		"Our late edict shall strongly stand in force:\n"+
		"Navarre shall be the wonder of the world;\n"+
		"Our court shall be a little Academe,\n"+
		"Still and contemplative in living art.\n"+
		"You three, Biron, Dumain, and Longaville,\n"+
		"Have sworn for three years' term to live with me\n"+
		"My fellow-scholars, and to keep those statutes\n"+
		"That are recorded in this schedule here:\n"+
		"Your oaths are pass'd; and now subscribe your names,\n"+
		"That his own hand may strike his honour down\n"+
		"That violates the smallest branch herein:\n"+
		"If you are arm'd to do as sworn to do,\n"+
		"Subscribe to your deep oaths, and keep it too.\n"+
		"LONGAVILLE\n"+
		"I am resolved; 'tis but a three years' fast:\n"+
		"The mind shall banquet, though the body pine:\n"+
		"Fat paunches have lean pates, and dainty bits\n"+
		"Make rich the ribs, but bankrupt quite the wits.\n"+
		"DUMAIN\n"+
		"My loving lord, Dumain is mortified:\n"+
		"The grosser manner of these world's delights\n"+
		"He throws upon the gross world's baser slaves:\n"+
		"To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die;\n"+
		"With all these living in philosophy.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"I can but say their protestation over;\n"+
		"So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,\n"+
		"That is, to live and study here three years.\n"+
		"But there are other strict observances;\n"+
		"As, not to see a woman in that term,\n"+
		"Which I hope well is not enrolled there;\n"+
		"And one day in a week to touch no food\n"+
		"And but one meal on every day beside,\n"+
		"The which I hope is not enrolled there;\n"+
		"And then, to sleep but three hours in the night,\n"+
		"And not be seen to wink of all the day--\n"+
		"When I was wont to think no harm all night\n"+
		"And make a dark night too of half the day--\n"+
		"Which I hope well is not enrolled there:\n"+
		"O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,\n"+
		"Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"Your oath is pass'd to pass away from these.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"Let me say no, my liege, an if you please:\n"+
		"I only swore to study with your grace\n"+
		"And stay here in your court for three years' space.\n"+
		"LONGAVILLE\n"+
		"You swore to that, Biron, and to the rest.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.\n"+
		"What is the end of study? let me know.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"Why, that to know, which else we should not know.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"Things hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense?\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"Ay, that is study's godlike recompense.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"Come on, then; I will swear to study so,\n"+
		"To know the thing I am forbid to know:\n"+
		"As thus,--to study where I well may dine,\n"+
		"When I to feast expressly am forbid;\n"+
		"Or study where to meet some mistress fine,\n"+
		"When mistresses from common sense are hid;\n"+
		"Or, having sworn too hard a keeping oath,\n"+
		"Study to break it and not break my troth.\n"+
		"If study's gain be thus and this be so,\n"+
		"Study knows that which yet it doth not know:\n"+
		"Swear me to this, and I will ne'er say no.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"These be the stops that hinder study quite\n"+
		"And train our intellects to vain delight.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"Why, all delights are vain; but that most vain,\n"+
		"Which with pain purchased doth inherit pain:\n"+
		"As, painfully to pore upon a book\n"+
		"To seek the light of truth; while truth the while\n"+
		"Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look:\n"+
		"Light seeking light doth light of light beguile:\n"+
		"So, ere you find where light in darkness lies,\n"+
		"Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.\n"+
		"Study me how to please the eye indeed\n"+
		"By fixing it upon a fairer eye,\n"+
		"Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed\n"+
		"And give him light that it was blinded by.\n"+
		"Study is like the heaven's glorious sun\n"+
		"That will not be deep-search'd with saucy looks:\n"+
		"Small have continual plodders ever won\n"+
		"Save base authority from others' books\n"+
		"These earthly godfathers of heaven's lights\n"+
		"That give a name to every fixed star\n"+
		"Have no more profit of their shining nights\n"+
		"Than those that walk and wot not what they are.\n"+
		"Too much to know is to know nought but fame;\n"+
		"And every godfather can give a name.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"How well he's read, to reason against reading!\n"+
		"DUMAIN\n"+
		"Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding!\n"+
		"LONGAVILLE\n"+
		"He weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"The spring is near when green geese are a-breeding.\n"+
		"DUMAIN\n"+
		"How follows that?\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"Fit in his place and time.\n"+
		"DUMAIN\n"+
		"In reason nothing.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"Something then in rhyme.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"Biron is like an envious sneaping frost,\n"+
		"That bites the first-born infants of the spring.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"Well, say I am; why should proud summer boast\n"+
		"Before the birds have any cause to sing?\n"+
		"Why should I joy in any abortive birth?\n"+
		"At Christmas I no more desire a rose\n"+
		"Than wish a snow in May's new-fangled mirth;\n"+
		"But like of each thing that in season grows.\n"+
		"So you, to study now it is too late,\n"+
		"Climb o'er the house to unlock the little gate.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"Well, sit you out: go home, Biron: adieu.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"No, my good lord; I have sworn to stay with you:\n"+
		"And though I have for barbarism spoke more\n"+
		"Than for that angel knowledge you can say,\n"+
		"Yet confident I'll keep what I have swore\n"+
		"And bide the penance of each three years' day.\n"+
		"Give me the paper; let me read the same;\n"+
		"And to the strict'st decrees I'll write my name.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"How well this yielding rescues thee from shame!\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"[Reads] 'Item, That no woman shall come within a\n"+
		"mile of my court:' Hath this been proclaimed?\n"+
		"LONGAVILLE\n"+
		"Four days ago.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"Let's see the penalty.\n"+
		"Reads\n"+
		"'On pain of losing her tongue.' Who devised this penalty?\n"+
		"LONGAVILLE\n"+
		"Marry, that did I.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"Sweet lord, and why?\n"+
		"LONGAVILLE\n"+
		"To fright them hence with that dread penalty.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"A dangerous law against gentility!\n"+
		"Reads\n"+
		"'Item, If any man be seen to talk with a woman\n"+
		"within the term of three years, he shall endure such\n"+
		"public shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise.'\n"+
		"This article, my liege, yourself must break;\n"+
		"For well you know here comes in embassy\n"+
		"The French king's daughter with yourself to speak--\n"+
		"A maid of grace and complete majesty--\n"+
		"About surrender up of Aquitaine\n"+
		"To her decrepit, sick and bedrid father:\n"+
		"Therefore this article is made in vain,\n"+
		"Or vainly comes the admired princess hither.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"What say you, lords? Why, this was quite forgot.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"So study evermore is overshot:\n"+
		"While it doth study to have what it would\n"+
		"It doth forget to do the thing it should,\n"+
		"And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,\n"+
		"'Tis won as towns with fire, so won, so lost.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"We must of force dispense with this decree;\n"+
		"She must lie here on mere necessity.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"Necessity will make us all forsworn\n"+
		"Three thousand times within this three years' space;\n"+
		"For every man with his affects is born,\n"+
		"Not by might master'd but by special grace:\n"+
		"If I break faith, this word shall speak for me;\n"+
		"I am forsworn on 'mere necessity.'\n"+
		"So to the laws at large I write my name:\n"+
		"Subscribes\n"+
		"And he that breaks them in the least degree\n"+
		"Stands in attainder of eternal shame:\n"+
		"Suggestions are to other as to me;\n"+
		"But I believe, although I seem so loath,\n"+
		"I am the last that will last keep his oath.\n"+
		"But is there no quick recreation granted?\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"Ay, that there is. Our court, you know, is haunted\n"+
		"With a refined traveller of Spain;\n"+
		"A man in all the world's new fashion planted,\n"+
		"That hath a mint of phrases in his brain;\n"+
		"One whom the music of his own vain tongue\n"+
		"Doth ravish like enchanting harmony;\n"+
		"A man of complements, whom right and wrong\n"+
		"Have chose as umpire of their mutiny:\n"+
		"This child of fancy, that Armado hight,\n"+
		"For interim to our studies shall relate\n"+
		"In high-born words the worth of many a knight\n"+
		"From tawny Spain lost in the world's debate.\n"+
		"How you delight, my lords, I know not, I;\n"+
		"But, I protest, I love to hear him lie\n"+
		"And I will use him for my minstrelsy.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"Armado is a most illustrious wight,\n"+
		"A man of fire-new words, fashion's own knight.\n"+
		"LONGAVILLE\n"+
		"Costard the swain and he shall be our sport;\n"+
		"And so to study, three years is but short.\n"+
		"Enter DULL with a letter, and COSTARD\n"+
		"DULL\n"+
		"Which is the duke's own person?\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"This, fellow: what wouldst?\n"+
		"DULL\n"+
		"I myself reprehend his own person, for I am his\n"+
		"grace's tharborough: but I would see his own person\n"+
		"in flesh and blood.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"This is he.\n"+
		"DULL\n"+
		"Signior Arme--Arme--commends you. There's villany\n"+
		"abroad: this letter will tell you more.\n"+
		"COSTARD\n"+
		"Sir, the contempts thereof are as touching me.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"A letter from the magnificent Armado.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"How low soever the matter, I hope in God for high words.\n"+
		"LONGAVILLE\n"+
		"A high hope for a low heaven: God grant us patience!\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"To hear? or forbear laughing?\n"+
		"LONGAVILLE\n"+
		"To hear meekly, sir, and to laugh moderately; or to\n"+
		"forbear both.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"Well, sir, be it as the style shall give us cause to\n"+
		"climb in the merriness.\n"+
		"COSTARD\n"+
		"The matter is to me, sir, as concerning Jaquenetta.\n"+
		"The manner of it is, I was taken with the manner.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"In what manner?\n"+
		"COSTARD\n"+
		"In manner and form following, sir; all those three:\n"+
		"I was seen with her in the manor-house, sitting with\n"+
		"her upon the form, and taken following her into the\n"+
		"park; which, put together, is in manner and form\n"+
		"following. Now, sir, for the manner,--it is the\n"+
		"manner of a man to speak to a woman: for the form,--\n"+
		"in some form.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"For the following, sir?\n"+
		"COSTARD\n"+
		"As it shall follow in my correction: and God defend\n"+
		"the right!\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"Will you hear this letter with attention?\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"As we would hear an oracle.\n"+
		"COSTARD\n"+
		"Such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"[Reads] 'Great deputy, the welkin's vicegerent and\n"+
		"sole dominator of Navarre, my soul's earth's god,\n"+
		"and body's fostering patron.'\n"+
		"COSTARD\n"+
		"Not a word of Costard yet.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"[Reads] 'So it is,'--\n"+
		"COSTARD\n"+
		"It may be so: but if he say it is so, he is, in\n"+
		"telling true, but so.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"Peace!\n"+
		"COSTARD\n"+
		"Be to me and every man that dares not fight!\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"No words!\n"+
		"COSTARD\n"+
		"Of other men's secrets, I beseech you.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"[Reads] 'So it is, besieged with sable-coloured\n"+
		"melancholy, I did commend the black-oppressing humour\n"+
		"to the most wholesome physic of thy health-giving\n"+
		"air; and, as I am a gentleman, betook myself to\n"+
		"walk. The time when. About the sixth hour; when\n"+
		"beasts most graze, birds best peck, and men sit down\n"+
		"to that nourishment which is called supper: so much\n"+
		"for the time when. Now for the ground which; which,\n"+
		"I mean, I walked upon: it is y-cleped thy park. Then\n"+
		"for the place where; where, I mean, I did encounter\n"+
		"that obscene and preposterous event, that draweth\n"+
		"from my snow-white pen the ebon-coloured ink, which\n"+
		"here thou viewest, beholdest, surveyest, or seest;\n"+
		"but to the place where; it standeth north-north-east\n"+
		"and by east from the west corner of thy curious-\n"+
		"knotted garden: there did I see that low-spirited\n"+
		"swain, that base minnow of thy mirth,'--\n"+
		"COSTARD\n"+
		"Me?\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"[Reads] 'that unlettered small-knowing soul,'--\n"+
		"COSTARD\n"+
		"Me?\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"[Reads] 'that shallow vassal,'--\n"+
		"COSTARD\n"+
		"Still me?\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"[Reads] 'which, as I remember, hight Costard,'--\n"+
		"COSTARD\n"+
		"O, me!\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"[Reads] 'sorted and consorted, contrary to thy\n"+
		"established proclaimed edict and continent canon,\n"+
		"which with,--O, with--but with this I passion to say\n"+
		"wherewith,--\n"+
		"COSTARD\n"+
		"With a wench.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"[Reads] 'with a child of our grandmother Eve, a\n"+
		"female; or, for thy more sweet understanding, a\n"+
		"woman. Him I, as my ever-esteemed duty pricks me on,\n"+

		"[Reads] 'For Jaquenetta,--so is the weaker vessel\n"+
		"called which I apprehended with the aforesaid\n"+

		"and shall, at the least of thy sweet notice, bring\n"+
		"her to trial. Thine, in all compliments of devoted\n"+
		"and heart-burning heat of duty.\n"+
		"DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO.'\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"This is not so well as I looked for, but the best\n"+
		"that ever I heard.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"Ay, the best for the worst. But, sirrah, what say\n"+
		"you to this?\n"+
		"COSTARD\n"+
		"Sir, I confess the wench.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"Did you hear the proclamation?\n"+
		"COSTARD\n"+
		"I do confess much of the hearing it but little of\n"+
		"the marking of it.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"It was proclaimed a year's imprisonment, to be taken\n"+
		"with a wench.\n"+
		"COSTARD\n"+
		"I was taken with none, sir: I was taken with a damsel.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"Well, it was proclaimed 'damsel.'\n"+
		"COSTARD\n"+
		"This was no damsel, neither, sir; she was a virgin.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"It is so varied, too; for it was proclaimed 'virgin.'\n"+
		"COSTARD\n"+
		"If it were, I deny her virginity: I was taken with a maid.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"This maid will not serve your turn, sir.\n"+
		"COSTARD\n"+
		"This maid will serve my turn, sir.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"Sir, I will pronounce your sentence: you shall fast\n"+
		"a week with bran and water.\n"+
		"COSTARD\n"+
		"I had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"And Don Armado shall be your keeper.\n"+
		"My Lord Biron, see him deliver'd o'er:\n"+
		"And go we, lords, to put in practise that\n"+
		"Which each to other hath so strongly sworn.\n"+
		"Exeunt FERDINAND, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"I'll lay my head to any good man's hat,\n"+
		"These oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn.\n"+
		"Sirrah, come on.\n"+
		"COSTARD\n"+
		"I suffer for the truth, sir; for true it is, I was\n"+
		"taken with Jaquenetta, and Jaquenetta is a true\n"+
		"girl; and therefore welcome the sour cup of\n"+
		"prosperity! Affliction may one day smile again; and\n"+
		"till then, sit thee down, sorrow!\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"LOVE'S LABOURS LOST\n"+
		"SCENE II. The same.\n"+
		"Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO and MOTH\n"+
		"DON\n"+
		"ADRIANO DE ARMADO\n"+
		"Boy, what sign is it when a man of great spirit\n"+
		"grows melancholy?\n"+
		"MOTH\n"+
		"A great sign, sir, that he will look sad.\n"+
		"DON\n"+
		"ADRIANO DE ARMADO\n"+
		"Why, sadness is one and the self-same thing, dear imp.\n"+
		"MOTH\n"+
		"No, no; O Lord, sir, no.\n"+
		"DON\n"+
		"ADRIANO DE ARMADO\n"+
		"How canst thou part sadness and melancholy, my\n"+
		"tender juvenal?\n"+
		"MOTH\n"+
		"By a familiar demonstration of the working, my tough senior.\n"+
		"DON\n"+
		"ADRIANO DE ARMADO\n"+
		"Why tough senior? why tough senior?\n"+
		"MOTH\n"+
		"Why tender juvenal? why tender juvenal?\n"+
		"DON\n"+
		"ADRIANO DE ARMADO\n"+
		"I spoke it, tender juvenal, as a congruent epitheton\n"+
		"appertaining to thy young days, which we may\n"+
		"nominate tender.\n"+
		"MOTH\n"+
		"And I, tough senior, as an appertinent title to your\n"+
		"old time, which we may name tough.\n"+
		"DON ADRIANO DE\n"+
		"ARMADO\n"+
		"Pretty and apt.\n"+
		"MOTH\n"+
		"How mean you, sir? I pretty, and my saying apt? or\n"+
		"I apt, and my saying pretty?\n"+
		"DON\n"+
		"ADRIANO DE ARMADO\n"+
		"Thou pretty, because little.\n"+
		"MOTH\n"+
		"Little pretty, because little. Wherefore apt?\n"+
		"DON\n"+
		"ADRIANO DE ARMADO\n"+
		"And therefore apt, because quick.\n"+
		"MOTH\n"+
		"Speak you this in my praise, master?\n"+
		"DON\n"+
		"ADRIANO DE ARMADO\n"+
		"In thy condign praise.\n"+
		"MOTH\n"+
		"I will praise an eel with the same praise.\n"+
		"DON\n"+
		"ADRIANO DE ARMADO\n"+
		"What, that an eel is ingenious?\n"+
		"MOTH\n"+
		"That an eel is quick.\n"+
		"DON\n"+
		"ADRIANO DE ARMADO\n"+
		"I do say thou art quick in answers: thou heatest my blood.\n"+
		"MOTH\n"+
		"I am answered, sir.\n"+
		"DON\n"+
		"ADRIANO DE ARMADO\n"+
		"I love not to be crossed.\n"+
		"MOTH\n"+
		"[Aside] He speaks the mere contrary; crosses love not him.\n"+
		"DON\n"+
		"ADRIANO DE ARMADO\n"+
		"I have promised to study three years with the duke.\n"+
		"MOTH\n"+
		"You may do it in an hour, sir.\n"+
		"DON\n"+
		"ADRIANO DE ARMADO\n"+
		"Impossible.\n"+
		"MOTH\n"+
		"How many is one thrice told?\n"+
		"DON\n"+
		"ADRIANO DE ARMADO\n"+
		"I am ill at reckoning; it fitteth the spirit of a tapster.\n"+
		"MOTH\n"+
		"You are a gentleman and a gamester, sir.\n"+
		"DON\n"+
		"ADRIANO DE ARMADO\n"+
		"I confess both: they are both the varnish of a\n"+
		"complete man.\n"+
		"MOTH\n"+
		"Then, I am sure, you know how much the gross sum of\n"+
		"deuce-ace amounts to.\n"+
		"DON\n"+
		"ADRIANO DE ARMADO\n"+
		"It doth amount to one more than two.\n"+
		"MOTH\n"+
		"Which the base vulgar do call three.\n"+
		"DON\n"+
		"ADRIANO DE ARMADO\n"+
		"True.\n"+
		"MOTH\n"+
		"Why, sir, is this such a piece of study? Now here\n"+
		"is three studied, ere ye'll thrice wink: and how\n"+
		"easy it is to put 'years' to the word 'three,' and\n"+
		"study three years in two words, the dancing horse\n"+
		"will tell you.\n"+
		"DON\n"+
		"ADRIANO DE ARMADO\n"+
		"A most fine figure!\n"+
		"MOTH\n"+
		"To prove you a cipher.\n"+
		"DON\n"+
		"ADRIANO DE ARMADO\n"+
		"I will hereupon confess I am in love: and as it is\n"+
		"base for a soldier to love, so am I in love with a\n"+
		"base wench. If drawing my sword against the humour\n"+
		"of affection would deliver me from the reprobate\n"+
		"thought of it, I would take Desire prisoner, and\n"+
		"ransom him to any French courtier for a new-devised\n"+
		"courtesy. I think scorn to sigh: methinks I should\n"+
		"outswear Cupid. Comfort, me, boy: what great men\n"+
		"have been in love?\n"+
		"MOTH\n"+
		"Hercules, master.\n"+
		"DON\n"+
		"ADRIANO DE ARMADO\n"+
		"Most sweet Hercules! More authority, dear boy, name\n"+
		"more; and, sweet my child, let them be men of good\n"+
		"repute and carriage.\n"+
		"MOTH\n"+
		"Samson, master: he was a man of good carriage, great\n"+
		"carriage, for he carried the town-gates on his back\n"+
		"like a porter: and he was in love.\n"+
		"DON\n"+
		"ADRIANO DE ARMADO\n"+
		"O well-knit Samson! strong-jointed Samson! I do\n"+
		"excel thee in my rapier as much as thou didst me in\n"+
		"carrying gates. I am in love too. Who was Samson's\n"+
		"love, my dear Moth?\n"+
		"MOTH\n"+
		"A woman, master.\n"+
		"DON\n"+
		"ADRIANO DE ARMADO\n"+
		"Of what complexion?\n"+
		"MOTH\n"+
		"Of all the four, or the three, or the two, or one of the four.\n"+
		"DON\n"+
		"ADRIANO DE ARMADO\n"+
		"Tell me precisely of what complexion.\n"+
		"MOTH\n"+
		"Of the sea-water green, sir.\n"+
		"DON\n"+
		"ADRIANO DE ARMADO\n"+
		"Is that one of the four complexions?\n"+
		"MOTH\n"+
		"As I have read, sir; and the best of them too.\n"+
		"DON\n"+
		"ADRIANO DE ARMADO\n"+
		"Green indeed is the colour of lovers; but to have a\n"+
		"love of that colour, methinks Samson had small reason\n"+
		"for it. He surely affected her for her wit.\n"+
		"MOTH\n"+
		"It was so, sir; for she had a green wit.\n"+

		"BOYET\n"+
		"Now, madam, summon up your dearest spirits:\n"+
		"Consider who the king your father sends,\n"+
		"To whom he sends, and what's his embassy:\n"+
		"Yourself, held precious in the world's esteem,\n"+
		"To parley with the sole inheritor\n"+
		"Of all perfections that a man may owe,\n"+
		"Matchless Navarre; the plea of no less weight\n"+
		"Than Aquitaine, a dowry for a queen.\n"+
		"Be now as prodigal of all dear grace\n"+
		"As Nature was in making graces dear\n"+
		"When she did starve the general world beside\n"+
		"And prodigally gave them all to you.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"Good Lord Boyet, my beauty, though but mean,\n"+
		"Needs not the painted flourish of your praise:\n"+
		"Beauty is bought by judgement of the eye,\n"+
		"Not utter'd by base sale of chapmen's tongues:\n"+
		"I am less proud to hear you tell my worth\n"+
		"Than you much willing to be counted wise\n"+
		"In spending your wit in the praise of mine.\n"+
		"But now to task the tasker: good Boyet,\n"+
		"You are not ignorant, all-telling fame\n"+
		"Doth noise abroad, Navarre hath made a vow,\n"+
		"Till painful study shall outwear three years,\n"+
		"No woman may approach his silent court:\n"+
		"Therefore to's seemeth it a needful course,\n"+
		"Before we enter his forbidden gates,\n"+
		"To know his pleasure; and in that behalf,\n"+
		"Bold of your worthiness, we single you\n"+
		"As our best-moving fair solicitor.\n"+
		"Tell him, the daughter of the King of France,\n"+
		"On serious business, craving quick dispatch,\n"+
		"Importunes personal conference with his grace:\n"+
		"Haste, signify so much; while we attend,\n"+
		"Like humble-visaged suitors, his high will.\n"+
		"BOYET\n"+
		"Proud of employment, willingly I go.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"All pride is willing pride, and yours is so.\n"+
		"Exit BOYET\n"+
		"Who are the votaries, my loving lords,\n"+
		"That are vow-fellows with this virtuous duke?\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"Lord Longaville is one.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"Know you the man?\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"I know him, madam: at a marriage-feast,\n"+
		"Between Lord Perigort and the beauteous heir\n"+
		"Of Jaques Falconbridge, solemnized\n"+
		"In Normandy, saw I this Longaville:\n"+
		"A man of sovereign parts he is esteem'd;\n"+
		"Well fitted in arts, glorious in arms:\n"+
		"Nothing becomes him ill that he would well.\n"+
		"The only soil of his fair virtue's gloss,\n"+
		"If virtue's gloss will stain with any soil,\n"+
		"Is a sharp wit matched with too blunt a will;\n"+
		"Whose edge hath power to cut, whose will still wills\n"+
		"It should none spare that come within his power.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"Some merry mocking lord, belike; is't so?\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"They say so most that most his humours know.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"Such short-lived wits do wither as they grow.\n"+
		"Who are the rest?\n"+
		"KATHARINE\n"+
		"The young Dumain, a well-accomplished youth,\n"+
		"Of all that virtue love for virtue loved:\n"+
		"Most power to do most harm, least knowing ill;\n"+
		"For he hath wit to make an ill shape good,\n"+
		"And shape to win grace though he had no wit.\n"+
		"I saw him at the Duke Alencon's once;\n"+
		"And much too little of that good I saw\n"+
		"Is my report to his great worthiness.\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"Another of these students at that time\n"+
		"Was there with him, if I have heard a truth.\n"+
		"Biron they call him; but a merrier man,\n"+
		"Within the limit of becoming mirth,\n"+
		"I never spent an hour's talk withal:\n"+
		"His eye begets occasion for his wit;\n"+
		"For every object that the one doth catch\n"+
		"The other turns to a mirth-moving jest,\n"+
		"Which his fair tongue, conceit's expositor,\n"+
		"Delivers in such apt and gracious words\n"+
		"That aged ears play truant at his tales\n"+
		"And younger hearings are quite ravished;\n"+
		"So sweet and voluble is his discourse.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"God bless my ladies! are they all in love,\n"+
		"That every one her own hath garnished\n"+
		"With such bedecking ornaments of praise?\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"Here comes Boyet.\n"+
		"Re-enter BOYET\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"Now, what admittance, lord?\n"+
		"BOYET\n"+
		"Navarre had notice of your fair approach;\n"+
		"And he and his competitors in oath\n"+
		"Were all address'd to meet you, gentle lady,\n"+
		"Before I came. Marry, thus much I have learnt:\n"+
		"He rather means to lodge you in the field,\n"+
		"Like one that comes here to besiege his court,\n"+
		"Than seek a dispensation for his oath,\n"+
		"To let you enter his unpeopled house.\n"+
		"Here comes Navarre.\n"+
		"Enter FERDINAND, LONGAVILLE, DUMAIN, BIRON, and Attendants\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"Fair princess, welcome to the court of Navarre.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"'Fair' I give you back again; and 'welcome' I have\n"+
		"not yet: the roof of this court is too high to be\n"+
		"yours; and welcome to the wide fields too base to be mine.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"You shall be welcome, madam, to my court.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"I will be welcome, then: conduct me thither.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"Hear me, dear lady; I have sworn an oath.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"Our Lady help my lord! he'll be forsworn.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"Not for the world, fair madam, by my will.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"Why, will shall break it; will and nothing else.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"Your ladyship is ignorant what it is.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"Were my lord so, his ignorance were wise,\n"+
		"Where now his knowledge must prove ignorance.\n"+
		"I hear your grace hath sworn out house-keeping:\n"+
		"Tis deadly sin to keep that oath, my lord,\n"+
		"And sin to break it.\n"+
		"But pardon me. I am too sudden-bold:\n"+
		"To teach a teacher ill beseemeth me.\n"+
		"Vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming,\n"+
		"And suddenly resolve me in my suit.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"Madam, I will, if suddenly I may.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"You will the sooner, that I were away;\n"+
		"For you'll prove perjured if you make me stay.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"I know you did.\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"How needless was it then to ask the question!\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"You must not be so quick.\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"'Tis 'long of you that spur me with such questions.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"Your wit's too hot, it speeds too fast, 'twill tire.\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"Not till it leave the rider in the mire.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"What time o' day?\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"The hour that fools should ask.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"Now fair befall your mask!\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"Fair fall the face it covers!\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"And send you many lovers!\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"Amen, so you be none.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"Nay, then will I be gone.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"Madam, your father here doth intimate\n"+
		"The payment of a hundred thousand crowns;\n"+
		"Being but the one half of an entire sum\n"+
		"Disbursed by my father in his wars.\n"+
		"But say that he or we, as neither have,\n"+
		"Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid\n"+
		"A hundred thousand more; in surety of the which,\n"+
		"One part of Aquitaine is bound to us,\n"+
		"Although not valued to the money's worth.\n"+
		"If then the king your father will restore\n"+
		"But that one half which is unsatisfied,\n"+
		"We will give up our right in Aquitaine,\n"+
		"And hold fair friendship with his majesty.\n"+
		"But that, it seems, he little purposeth,\n"+
		"For here he doth demand to have repaid\n"+
		"A hundred thousand crowns; and not demands,\n"+
		"On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,\n"+
		"To have his title live in Aquitaine;\n"+
		"Which we much rather had depart withal\n"+
		"And have the money by our father lent\n"+
		"Than Aquitaine so gelded as it is.\n"+
		"Dear Princess, were not his requests so far\n"+
		"From reason's yielding, your fair self should make\n"+
		"A yielding 'gainst some reason in my breast\n"+
		"And go well satisfied to France again.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"You do the king my father too much wrong\n"+
		"And wrong the reputation of your name,\n"+
		"In so unseeming to confess receipt\n"+
		"Of that which hath so faithfully been paid.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"I do protest I never heard of it;\n"+
		"And if you prove it, I'll repay it back\n"+
		"Or yield up Aquitaine.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"We arrest your word.\n"+
		"Boyet, you can produce acquittances\n"+
		"For such a sum from special officers\n"+
		"Of Charles his father.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"Satisfy me so.\n"+
		"BOYET\n"+
		"So please your grace, the packet is not come\n"+
		"Where that and other specialties are bound:\n"+
		"To-morrow you shall have a sight of them.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"It shall suffice me: at which interview\n"+
		"All liberal reason I will yield unto.\n"+
		"Meantime receive such welcome at my hand\n"+
		"As honour without breach of honour may\n"+
		"Make tender of to thy true worthiness:\n"+
		"You may not come, fair princess, in my gates;\n"+
		"But here without you shall be so received\n"+
		"As you shall deem yourself lodged in my heart,\n"+
		"Though so denied fair harbour in my house.\n"+
		"Your own good thoughts excuse me, and farewell:\n"+
		"To-morrow shall we visit you again.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"Sweet health and fair desires consort your grace!\n"+

		"Thy own wish wish I thee in every place!\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"Lady, I will commend you to mine own heart.\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"Pray you, do my commendations; I would be glad to see it.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"I would you heard it groan.\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"Is the fool sick?\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"Sick at the heart.\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"Alack, let it blood.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"Would that do it good?\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"My physic says 'ay.'\n"+

		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"No point, with my knife.\n"+

		"Sir, I pray you, a word: what lady is that same?\n"+

		"The heir of Alencon, Katharine her name.\n"+
		"DUMAIN\n"+
		"A gallant lady. Monsieur, fare you well.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"LONGAVILLE\n"+
		"I beseech you a word: what is she in the white?\n"+
		"BOYET\n"+
		"A woman sometimes, an you saw her in the light.\n"+
		"LONGAVILLE\n"+
		"Perchance light in the light. I desire her name.\n"+
		"BOYET\n"+
		"She hath but one for herself; to desire that were a shame.\n"+
		"LONGAVILLE\n"+
		"Pray you, sir, whose daughter?\n"+
		"BOYET\n"+
		"Her mother's, I have heard.\n"+
		"LONGAVILLE\n"+
		"God's blessing on your beard!\n"+
		"BOYET\n"+
		"Good sir, be not offended.\n"+
		"She is an heir of Falconbridge.\n"+
		"LONGAVILLE\n"+
		"Nay, my choler is ended.\n"+
		"She is a most sweet lady.\n"+
		"BOYET\n"+
		"Not unlike, sir, that may be.\n"+
		"Exit LONGAVILLE\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"What's her name in the cap?\n"+
		"BOYET\n"+
		"Rosaline, by good hap.\n"+

		"BOYET\n"+
		"To her will, sir, or so.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"You are welcome, sir: adieu.\n"+
		"BOYET\n"+
		"Farewell to me, sir, and welcome to you.\n"+
		"Exit BIRON\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"That last is Biron, the merry madcap lord:\n"+
		"Not a word with him but a jest.\n"+
		"BOYET\n"+
		"And every jest but a word.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"It was well done of you to take him at his word.\n"+
		"BOYET\n"+
		"I was as willing to grapple as he was to board.\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"Two hot sheeps, marry.\n"+
		"BOYET\n"+
		"And wherefore not ships?\n"+
		"No sheep, sweet lamb, unless we feed on your lips.\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"You sheep, and I pasture: shall that finish the jest?\n"+
		"BOYET\n"+
		"So you grant pasture for me.\n"+
		"Offering to kiss her\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"Not so, gentle beast:\n"+
		"My lips are no common, though several they be.\n"+
		"BOYET\n"+
		"Belonging to whom?\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"To my fortunes and me.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"Good wits will be jangling; but, gentles, agree:\n"+
		"This civil war of wits were much better used\n"+
		"On Navarre and his book-men; for here 'tis abused.\n"+
		"BOYET\n"+
		"If my observation, which very seldom lies,\n"+
		"By the heart's still rhetoric disclosed with eyes,\n"+
		"Deceive me not now, Navarre is infected.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"With what?\n"+
		"BOYET\n"+
		"With that which we lovers entitle affected.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"Your reason?\n"+
		"BOYET\n"+
		"Why, all his behaviors did make their retire\n"+
		"To the court of his eye, peeping thorough desire:\n"+
		"His heart, like an agate, with your print impress'd,\n"+
		"Proud with his form, in his eye pride express'd:\n"+
		"His tongue, all impatient to speak and not see,\n"+
		"Did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be;\n"+
		"All senses to that sense did make their repair,\n"+
		"To feel only looking on fairest of fair:\n"+
		"Methought all his senses were lock'd in his eye,\n"+
		"As jewels in crystal for some prince to buy;\n"+
		"Who, tendering their own worth from where they were glass'd,\n"+
		"Did point you to buy them, along as you pass'd:\n"+
		"His face's own margent did quote such amazes\n"+
		"That all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes.\n"+
		"I'll give you Aquitaine and all that is his,\n"+
		"An you give him for my sake but one loving kiss.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"Come to our pavilion: Boyet is disposed.\n"+
		"BOYET\n"+
		"But to speak that in words which his eye hath\n"+
		"disclosed.\n"+
		"I only have made a mouth of his eye,\n"+
		"By adding a tongue which I know will not lie.\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"Thou art an old love-monger and speakest skilfully.\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"He is Cupid's grandfather and learns news of him.\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"Then was Venus like her mother, for her father is but grim.\n"+
		"BOYET\n"+
		"Do you hear, my mad wenches?\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"No.\n"+
		"BOYET\n"+
		"What then, do you see?\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"Ay, our way to be gone.\n"+

		"DON\n"+
		"ADRIANO DE ARMADO\n"+
		"How meanest thou? brawling in French?\n"+
		"MOTH\n"+
		"No, my complete master: but to jig off a tune at\n"+
		"the tongue's end, canary to it with your feet, humour\n"+
		"it with turning up your eyelids, sigh a note and\n"+
		"sing a note, sometime through the throat, as if you\n"+
		"swallowed love with singing love, sometime through\n"+
		"the nose, as if you snuffed up love by smelling\n"+
		"love; with your hat penthouse-like o'er the shop of\n"+
		"your eyes; with your arms crossed on your thin-belly\n"+
		"doublet like a rabbit on a spit; or your hands in\n"+
		"your pocket like a man after the old painting; and\n"+

		"I know not; but I think it was not he.\n"+

		"Whoe'er a' was, a' show'd a mounting mind.\n"+
		"Well, lords, to-day we shall have our dispatch:\n"+
		"On Saturday we will return to France.\n"+
		"Then, forester, my friend, where is the bush\n"+
		"That we must stand and play the murderer in?\n"+
		"Forester\n"+
		"Hereby, upon the edge of yonder coppice;\n"+
		"A stand where you may make the fairest shoot.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"I thank my beauty, I am fair that shoot,\n"+
		"And thereupon thou speak'st the fairest shoot.\n"+
		"Forester\n"+
		"Pardon me, madam, for I meant not so.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"What, what? first praise me and again say no?\n"+
		"O short-lived pride! Not fair? alack for woe!\n"+
		"Forester\n"+
		"Yes, madam, fair.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"Nay, never paint me now:\n"+
		"Where fair is not, praise cannot mend the brow.\n"+
		"Here, good my glass, take this for telling true:\n"+
		"Fair payment for foul words is more than due.\n"+
		"Forester\n"+
		"Nothing but fair is that which you inherit.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"See see, my beauty will be saved by merit!\n"+
		"O heresy in fair, fit for these days!\n"+
		"A giving hand, though foul, shall have fair praise.\n"+
		"But come, the bow: now mercy goes to kill,\n"+
		"And shooting well is then accounted ill.\n"+
		"Thus will I save my credit in the shoot:\n"+
		"Not wounding, pity would not let me do't;\n"+
		"If wounding, then it was to show my skill,\n"+
		"That more for praise than purpose meant to kill.\n"+
		"And out of question so it is sometimes,\n"+
		"Glory grows guilty of detested crimes,\n"+
		"When, for fame's sake, for praise, an outward part,\n"+
		"We bend to that the working of the heart;\n"+
		"As I for praise alone now seek to spill\n"+
		"The poor deer's blood, that my heart means no ill.\n"+

		"Do not curst wives hold that self-sovereignty\n"+
		"Only for praise sake, when they strive to be\n"+

		"The thickest and the tallest.\n"+
		"COSTARD\n"+
		"The thickest and the tallest! it is so; truth is truth.\n"+
		"An your waist, mistress, were as slender as my wit,\n"+
		"One o' these maids' girdles for your waist should be fit.\n"+

		"I have a letter from Monsieur Biron to one Lady Rosaline.\n"+

		"Reads\n"+
		"BOYET\n"+
		"'By heaven, that thou art fair, is most infallible;\n"+

		"come? to see: why did he see? to overcome: to\n"+
		"whom came he? to the beggar: what saw he? the\n"+
		"beggar: who overcame he? the beggar. The\n"+
		"conclusion is victory: on whose side? the king's.\n"+
		"The captive is enriched: on whose side? the\n"+
		"beggar's. The catastrophe is a nuptial: on whose\n"+
		"side? the king's: no, on both in one, or one in\n"+
		"both. I am the king; for so stands the comparison:\n"+
		"thou the beggar; for so witnesseth thy lowliness.\n"+
		"Shall I command thy love? I may: shall I enforce\n"+
		"thy love? I could: shall I entreat thy love? I\n"+
		"will. What shalt thou exchange for rags? robes;\n"+

		"But if thou strive, poor soul, what art thou then?\n"+
		"Food for his rage, repasture for his den.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"What plume of feathers is he that indited this letter?\n"+
		"What vane? what weathercock? did you ever hear better?\n"+
		"BOYET\n"+
		"I am much deceived but I remember the style.\n"+

		"Else your memory is bad, going o'er it erewhile.\n"+

		"For native blood is counted painting now;\n"+
		"And therefore red, that would avoid dispraise,\n"+
		"Paints itself black, to imitate her brow.\n"+
		"DUMAIN\n"+
		"To look like her are chimney-sweepers black.\n"+
		"LONGAVILLE\n"+
		"And since her time are colliers counted bright.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"And Ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack.\n"+
		"DUMAIN\n"+
		"Dark needs no candles now, for dark is light.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"Your mistresses dare never come in rain,\n"+
		"For fear their colours should be wash'd away.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"'Twere good, yours did; for, sir, to tell you plain,\n"+
		"I'll find a fairer face not wash'd to-day.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"I'll prove her fair, or talk till doomsday here.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"No devil will fright thee then so much as she.\n"+
		"DUMAIN\n"+
		"I never knew man hold vile stuff so dear.\n"+
		"LONGAVILLE\n"+
		"Look, here's thy love: my foot and her face see.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"O, if the streets were paved with thine eyes,\n"+
		"Her feet were much too dainty for such tread!\n"+
		"DUMAIN\n"+
		"O, vile! then, as she goes, what upward lies\n"+
		"The street should see as she walk'd overhead.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"But what of this? are we not all in love?\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"Nothing so sure; and thereby all forsworn.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"Then leave this chat; and, good Biron, now prove\n"+
		"Our loving lawful, and our faith not torn.\n"+
		"DUMAIN\n"+
		"Ay, marry, there; some flattery for this evil.\n"+
		"LONGAVILLE\n"+
		"O, some authority how to proceed;\n"+
		"Some tricks, some quillets, how to cheat the devil.\n"+
		"DUMAIN\n"+
		"Some salve for perjury.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"'Tis more than need.\n"+
		"Have at you, then, affection's men at arms.\n"+
		"Consider what you first did swear unto,\n"+
		"To fast, to study, and to see no woman;\n"+
		"Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth.\n"+
		"Say, can you fast? your stomachs are too young;\n"+
		"And abstinence engenders maladies.\n"+
		"And where that you have vow'd to study, lords,\n"+
		"In that each of you have forsworn his book,\n"+
		"Can you still dream and pore and thereon look?\n"+
		"For when would you, my lord, or you, or you,\n"+
		"Have found the ground of study's excellence\n"+
		"Without the beauty of a woman's face?\n"+
		"From women's eyes this doctrine I derive; They are the ground, the books, the academes From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire\n"+
		"Why, universal plodding poisons up\n"+
		"The nimble spirits in the arteries,\n"+
		"As motion and long-during action tires\n"+
		"The sinewy vigour of the traveller.\n"+
		"Now, for not looking on a woman's face,\n"+
		"You have in that forsworn the use of eyes\n"+
		"And study too, the causer of your vow;\n"+
		"For where is any author in the world\n"+
		"Teaches such beauty as a woman's eye?\n"+
		"Learning is but an adjunct to ourself\n"+
		"And where we are our learning likewise is:\n"+
		"Then when ourselves we see in ladies' eyes,\n"+
		"Do we not likewise see our learning there?\n"+
		"O, we have made a vow to study, lords,\n"+
		"And in that vow we have forsworn our books.\n"+
		"For when would you, my liege, or you, or you,\n"+
		"In leaden contemplation have found out\n"+
		"Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes\n"+
		"Of beauty's tutors have enrich'd you with?\n"+
		"Other slow arts entirely keep the brain;\n"+
		"And therefore, finding barren practisers,\n"+
		"Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil:\n"+
		"But love, first learned in a lady's eyes,\n"+
		"Lives not alone immured in the brain;\n"+
		"But, with the motion of all elements,\n"+
		"Courses as swift as thought in every power,\n"+
		"And gives to every power a double power,\n"+
		"Above their functions and their offices.\n"+
		"It adds a precious seeing to the eye;\n"+
		"A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind;\n"+
		"A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,\n"+
		"When the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd:\n"+
		"Love's feeling is more soft and sensible\n"+
		"Than are the tender horns of cockl'd snails;\n"+
		"Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:\n"+
		"For valour, is not Love a Hercules,\n"+
		"Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?\n"+
		"Subtle as Sphinx; as sweet and musical\n"+
		"As bright Apollo's lute, strung with his hair:\n"+
		"And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods\n"+
		"Makes heaven drowsy with the harmony.\n"+
		"Never durst poet touch a pen to write\n"+
		"Until his ink were temper'd with Love's sighs;\n"+
		"O, then his lines would ravish savage ears\n"+
		"And plant in tyrants mild humility.\n"+
		"From women's eyes this doctrine I derive:\n"+
		"They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;\n"+
		"They are the books, the arts, the academes,\n"+
		"That show, contain and nourish all the world:\n"+
		"Else none at all in ought proves excellent.\n"+
		"Then fools you were these women to forswear,\n"+
		"Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.\n"+
		"For wisdom's sake, a word that all men love,\n"+
		"Or for love's sake, a word that loves all men,\n"+
		"Or for men's sake, the authors of these women,\n"+
		"Or women's sake, by whom we men are men,\n"+
		"Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves,\n"+
		"Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths.\n"+
		"It is religion to be thus forsworn,\n"+
		"For charity itself fulfills the law,\n"+
		"And who can sever love from charity?\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"Saint Cupid, then! and, soldiers, to the field!\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"Advance your standards, and upon them, lords;\n"+
		"Pell-mell, down with them! but be first advised,\n"+
		"In conflict that you get the sun of them.\n"+
		"LONGAVILLE\n"+
		"Now to plain-dealing; lay these glozes by:\n"+
		"Shall we resolve to woo these girls of France?\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"And win them too: therefore let us devise\n"+
		"Some entertainment for them in their tents.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"First, from the park let us conduct them thither;\n"+
		"Then homeward every man attach the hand\n"+
		"Of his fair mistress: in the afternoon\n"+
		"We will with some strange pastime solace them,\n"+
		"Such as the shortness of the time can shape;\n"+
		"For revels, dances, masks and merry hours\n"+
		"Forerun fair Love, strewing her way with flowers.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"Away, away! no time shall be omitted\n"+
		"That will betime, and may by us be fitted.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"Allons! allons! Sow'd cockle reap'd no corn;\n"+
		"And justice always whirls in equal measure:\n"+
		"Light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn;\n"+
		"If so, our copper buys no better treasure.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"LOVE'S LABOURS LOST\n"+
		"ACT V\n"+
		"SCENE I. The same.\n"+
		"Enter HOLOFERNES, SIR NATHANIEL, and DULL\n"+
		"HOLOFERNES\n"+
		"Satis quod sufficit.\n"+
		"SIR NATHANIEL\n"+
		"I praise God for you, sir: your reasons at dinner\n"+
		"have been sharp and sententious; pleasant without\n"+
		"scurrility, witty without affection, audacious without\n"+
		"impudency, learned without opinion, and strange with-\n"+
		"out heresy. I did converse this quondam day with\n"+
		"a companion of the king's, who is intituled, nomi-\n"+
		"nated, or called, Don Adriano de Armado.\n"+
		"HOLOFERNES\n"+
		"Novi hominem tanquam te: his humour is lofty, his\n"+
		"discourse peremptory, his tongue filed, his eye\n"+
		"ambitious, his gait majestical, and his general\n"+
		"behavior vain, ridiculous, and thrasonical. He is\n"+
		"too picked, too spruce, too affected, too odd, as it\n"+
		"were, too peregrinate, as I may call it.\n"+
		"SIR NATHANIEL\n"+
		"A most singular and choice epithet.\n"+
		"Draws out his table-book\n"+
		"HOLOFERNES\n"+
		"He draweth out the thread of his verbosity finer\n"+
		"than the staple of his argument. I abhor such\n"+
		"fanatical phantasimes, such insociable and\n"+
		"point-devise companions; such rackers of\n"+
		"orthography, as to speak dout, fine, when he should\n"+
		"say doubt; det, when he should pronounce debt,--d,\n"+
		"e, b, t, not d, e, t: he clepeth a calf, cauf;\n"+
		"half, hauf; neighbour vocatur nebor; neigh\n"+
		"abbreviated ne. This is abhominable,--which he\n"+
		"would call abbominable: it insinuateth me of\n"+
		"insanie: anne intelligis, domine? to make frantic, lunatic.\n"+
		"SIR NATHANIEL\n"+
		"Laus Deo, bene intelligo.\n"+
		"HOLOFERNES\n"+
		"Bon, bon, fort bon, Priscian! a little scratch'd,\n"+

		"Videsne quis venit?\n"+
		"HOLOFERNES\n"+
		"Video, et gaudeo.\n"+
		"Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO, MOTH, and COSTARD\n"+
		"DON\n"+
		"ADRIANO DE ARMADO\n"+
		"Chirrah!\n"+
		"To MOTH\n"+
		"HOLOFERNES\n"+
		"Quare chirrah, not sirrah?\n"+

		"ADRIANO DE ARMADO\n"+
		"Men of peace, well encountered.\n"+
		"HOLOFERNES\n"+
		"Most military sir, salutation.\n"+
		"MOTH\n"+
		"[Aside to COSTARD] They have been at a great feast\n"+
		"of languages, and stolen the scraps.\n"+
		"COSTARD\n"+
		"O, they have lived long on the alms-basket of words.\n"+
		"I marvel thy master hath not eaten thee for a word;\n"+
		"for thou art not so long by the head as\n"+

		"swallowed than a flap-dragon.\n"+
		"MOTH\n"+
		"Peace! the peal begins.\n"+
		"DON\n"+
		"ADRIANO DE ARMADO\n"+
		"[To HOLOFERNES] Monsieur, are you not lettered?\n"+
		"MOTH\n"+
		"Yes, yes; he teaches boys the hornbook. What is a,\n"+

		"HOLOFERNES\n"+
		"Ba, pueritia, with a horn added.\n"+
		"MOTH\n"+
		"Ba, most silly sheep with a horn. You hear his learning.\n"+

		"MOTH\n"+
		"The third of the five vowels, if you repeat them; or\n"+
		"the fifth, if I.\n"+
		"HOLOFERNES\n"+
		"I will repeat them,--a, e, i,--\n"+
		"MOTH\n"+
		"The sheep: the other two concludes it,--o, u.\n"+
		"DON\n"+
		"ADRIANO DE ARMADO\n"+
		"Now, by the salt wave of the Mediterraneum, a sweet\n"+
		"touch, a quick venue of wit! snip, snap, quick and\n"+
		"home! it rejoiceth my intellect: true wit!\n"+
		"MOTH\n"+
		"Offered by a child to an old man; which is wit-old.\n"+
		"HOLOFERNES\n"+

		"MOTH\n"+
		"Horns.\n"+

		"Thou disputest like an infant: go, whip thy gig.\n"+
		"MOTH\n"+
		"Lend me your horn to make one, and I will whip about\n"+
		"your infamy circum circa,--a gig of a cuckold's horn.\n"+
		"COSTARD\n"+
		"An I had but one penny in the world, thou shouldst\n"+

		"remuneration I had of thy master, thou halfpenny\n"+
		"purse of wit, thou pigeon-egg of discretion. O, an\n"+
		"the heavens were so pleased that thou wert but my\n"+
		"bastard, what a joyful father wouldst thou make me!\n"+
		"Go to; thou hast it ad dunghill, at the fingers'\n"+

		"HOLOFERNES\n"+
		"O, I smell false Latin; dunghill for unguem.\n"+
		"DON\n"+
		"ADRIANO DE ARMADO\n"+
		"Arts-man, preambulate, we will be singled from the\n"+
		"barbarous. Do you not educate youth at the\n"+
		"charge-house on the top of the mountain?\n"+
		"HOLOFERNES\n"+
		"Or mons, the hill.\n"+
		"DON\n"+
		"ADRIANO DE ARMADO\n"+
		"At your sweet pleasure, for the mountain.\n"+
		"HOLOFERNES\n"+
		"I do, sans question.\n"+
		"DON\n"+
		"ADRIANO DE ARMADO\n"+
		"Sir, it is the king's most sweet pleasure and\n"+
		"affection to congratulate the princess at her\n"+
		"pavilion in the posteriors of this day, which the\n"+
		"rude multitude call the afternoon.\n"+
		"HOLOFERNES\n"+
		"The posterior of the day, most generous sir, is\n"+
		"liable, congruent and measurable for the afternoon:\n"+
		"the word is well culled, chose, sweet and apt, I do\n"+
		"assure you, sir, I do assure.\n"+
		"DON\n"+
		"ADRIANO DE ARMADO\n"+
		"Sir, the king is a noble gentleman, and my familiar,\n"+
		"I do assure ye, very good friend: for what is\n"+
		"inward between us, let it pass. I do beseech thee,\n"+
		"remember thy courtesy; I beseech thee, apparel thy\n"+
		"head: and among other important and most serious\n"+
		"designs, and of great import indeed, too, but let\n"+
		"that pass: for I must tell thee, it will please his\n"+
		"grace, by the world, sometime to lean upon my poor\n"+
		"shoulder, and with his royal finger, thus, dally\n"+
		"with my excrement, with my mustachio; but, sweet\n"+
		"heart, let that pass. By the world, I recount no\n"+
		"fable: some certain special honours it pleaseth his\n"+
		"greatness to impart to Armado, a soldier, a man of\n"+
		"travel, that hath seen the world; but let that pass.\n"+
		"The very all of all is,--but, sweet heart, I do\n"+
		"implore secrecy,--that the king would have me\n"+
		"present the princess, sweet chuck, with some\n"+
		"delightful ostentation, or show, or pageant, or\n"+
		"antique, or firework. Now, understanding that the\n"+
		"curate and your sweet self are good at such\n"+
		"eruptions and sudden breaking out of mirth, as it\n"+
		"were, I have acquainted you withal, to the end to\n"+
		"crave your assistance.\n"+
		"HOLOFERNES\n"+
		"Sir, you shall present before her the Nine Worthies.\n"+
		"Sir, as concerning some entertainment of time, some\n"+
		"show in the posterior of this day, to be rendered by\n"+
		"our assistants, at the king's command, and this most\n"+
		"gallant, illustrate, and learned gentleman, before\n"+
		"the princess; I say none so fit as to present the\n"+
		"Nine Worthies.\n"+
		"SIR NATHANIEL\n"+
		"Where will you find men worthy enough to present them?\n"+
		"HOLOFERNES\n"+
		"Joshua, yourself; myself and this gallant gentleman,\n"+
		"Judas Maccabaeus; this swain, because of his great\n"+
		"limb or joint, shall pass Pompey the Great; the\n"+
		"page, Hercules,--\n"+
		"DON\n"+
		"ADRIANO DE ARMADO\n"+
		"Pardon, sir; error: he is not quantity enough for\n"+
		"that Worthy's thumb: he is not so big as the end of his club.\n"+
		"HOLOFERNES\n"+
		"Shall I have audience? he shall present Hercules in\n"+
		"minority: his enter and exit shall be strangling a\n"+
		"snake; and I will have an apology for that purpose.\n"+
		"MOTH\n"+
		"An excellent device! so, if any of the audience\n"+
		"hiss, you may cry 'Well done, Hercules! now thou\n"+
		"crushest the snake!' that is the way to make an\n"+
		"offence gracious, though few have the grace to do it.\n"+
		"DON\n"+
		"ADRIANO DE ARMADO\n"+
		"For the rest of the Worthies?--\n"+
		"HOLOFERNES\n"+
		"I will play three myself.\n"+
		"MOTH\n"+
		"Thrice-worthy gentleman!\n"+
		"DON\n"+
		"ADRIANO DE ARMADO\n"+
		"Shall I tell you a thing?\n"+
		"HOLOFERNES\n"+
		"We attend.\n"+
		"DON\n"+
		"ADRIANO DE ARMADO\n"+
		"We will have, if this fadge not, an antique. I\n"+
		"beseech you, follow.\n"+
		"HOLOFERNES\n"+
		"Via, goodman Dull! thou hast spoken no word all this while.\n"+
		"DULL\n"+
		"Nor understood none neither, sir.\n"+
		"HOLOFERNES\n"+
		"Allons! we will employ thee.\n"+
		"DULL\n"+
		"I'll make one in a dance, or so; or I will play\n"+
		"On the tabour to the Worthies, and let them dance the hay.\n"+
		"HOLOFERNES\n"+
		"Most dull, honest Dull! To our sport, away!\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"LOVE'S LABOURS LOST\n"+
		"SCENE II. The same.\n"+
		"Enter the PRINCESS, KATHARINE, ROSALINE, and MARIA\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"Sweet hearts, we shall be rich ere we depart,\n"+
		"If fairings come thus plentifully in:\n"+
		"A lady wall'd about with diamonds!\n"+
		"Look you what I have from the loving king.\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"Madame, came nothing else along with that?\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"Nothing but this! yes, as much love in rhyme\n"+
		"As would be cramm'd up in a sheet of paper,\n"+
		"Writ o' both sides the leaf, margent and all,\n"+
		"That he was fain to seal on Cupid's name.\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"That was the way to make his godhead wax,\n"+
		"For he hath been five thousand years a boy.\n"+
		"KATHARINE\n"+
		"Ay, and a shrewd unhappy gallows too.\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"You'll ne'er be friends with him; a' kill'd your sister.\n"+
		"KATHARINE\n"+
		"He made her melancholy, sad, and heavy;\n"+
		"And so she died: had she been light, like you,\n"+
		"Of such a merry, nimble, stirring spirit,\n"+
		"She might ha' been a grandam ere she died:\n"+
		"And so may you; for a light heart lives long.\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"What's your dark meaning, mouse, of this light word?\n"+
		"KATHARINE\n"+
		"A light condition in a beauty dark.\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"We need more light to find your meaning out.\n"+
		"KATHARINE\n"+
		"You'll mar the light by taking it in snuff;\n"+
		"Therefore I'll darkly end the argument.\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"Look what you do, you do it still i' the dark.\n"+
		"KATHARINE\n"+
		"So do not you, for you are a light wench.\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"Indeed I weigh not you, and therefore light.\n"+
		"KATHARINE\n"+
		"You weigh me not? O, that's you care not for me.\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"Great reason; for 'past cure is still past care.'\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"Well bandied both; a set of wit well play'd.\n"+
		"But Rosaline, you have a favour too:\n"+
		"Who sent it? and what is it?\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"I would you knew:\n"+
		"An if my face were but as fair as yours,\n"+
		"My favour were as great; be witness this.\n"+
		"Nay, I have verses too, I thank Biron:\n"+
		"The numbers true; and, were the numbering too,\n"+
		"I were the fairest goddess on the ground:\n"+
		"I am compared to twenty thousand fairs.\n"+
		"O, he hath drawn my picture in his letter!\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"Any thing like?\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"Much in the letters; nothing in the praise.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"Beauteous as ink; a good conclusion.\n"+
		"KATHARINE\n"+
		"Fair as a text B in a copy-book.\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"'Ware pencils, ho! let me not die your debtor,\n"+
		"My red dominical, my golden letter:\n"+
		"O, that your face were not so full of O's!\n"+
		"KATHARINE\n"+
		"A pox of that jest! and I beshrew all shrows.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"But, Katharine, what was sent to you from fair Dumain?\n"+
		"KATHARINE\n"+
		"Madam, this glove.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"Did he not send you twain?\n"+
		"KATHARINE\n"+
		"Yes, madam, and moreover\n"+
		"Some thousand verses of a faithful lover,\n"+
		"A huge translation of hypocrisy,\n"+
		"Vilely compiled, profound simplicity.\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"This and these pearls to me sent Longaville:\n"+
		"The letter is too long by half a mile.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"I think no less. Dost thou not wish in heart\n"+
		"The chain were longer and the letter short?\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"Ay, or I would these hands might never part.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"We are wise girls to mock our lovers so.\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"They are worse fools to purchase mocking so.\n"+
		"That same Biron I'll torture ere I go:\n"+
		"O that I knew he were but in by the week!\n"+
		"How I would make him fawn and beg and seek\n"+
		"And wait the season and observe the times\n"+
		"And spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes\n"+
		"And shape his service wholly to my hests\n"+
		"And make him proud to make me proud that jests!\n"+
		"So perttaunt-like would I o'ersway his state\n"+
		"That he should be my fool and I his fate.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"None are so surely caught, when they are catch'd,\n"+
		"As wit turn'd fool: folly, in wisdom hatch'd,\n"+
		"Hath wisdom's warrant and the help of school\n"+
		"And wit's own grace to grace a learned fool.\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"The blood of youth burns not with such excess\n"+
		"As gravity's revolt to wantonness.\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"Folly in fools bears not so strong a note\n"+
		"As foolery in the wise, when wit doth dote;\n"+
		"Since all the power thereof it doth apply\n"+
		"To prove, by wit, worth in simplicity.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"Here comes Boyet, and mirth is in his face.\n"+
		"Enter BOYET\n"+
		"BOYET\n"+
		"O, I am stabb'd with laughter! Where's her grace?\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"Thy news Boyet?\n"+
		"BOYET\n"+
		"Prepare, madam, prepare!\n"+
		"Arm, wenches, arm! encounters mounted are\n"+
		"Against your peace: Love doth approach disguised,\n"+
		"Armed in arguments; you'll be surprised:\n"+
		"Muster your wits; stand in your own defence;\n"+
		"Or hide your heads like cowards, and fly hence.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"Saint Denis to Saint Cupid! What are they\n"+
		"That charge their breath against us? say, scout, say.\n"+
		"BOYET\n"+
		"Under the cool shade of a sycamore\n"+
		"I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour;\n"+
		"When, lo! to interrupt my purposed rest,\n"+
		"Toward that shade I might behold addrest\n"+
		"The king and his companions: warily\n"+
		"I stole into a neighbour thicket by,\n"+
		"And overheard what you shall overhear,\n"+
		"That, by and by, disguised they will be here.\n"+
		"Their herald is a pretty knavish page,\n"+
		"That well by heart hath conn'd his embassage:\n"+
		"Action and accent did they teach him there;\n"+
		"'Thus must thou speak,' and 'thus thy body bear:'\n"+
		"And ever and anon they made a doubt\n"+
		"Presence majestical would put him out,\n"+
		"'For,' quoth the king, 'an angel shalt thou see;\n"+
		"Yet fear not thou, but speak audaciously.'\n"+
		"The boy replied, 'An angel is not evil;\n"+
		"I should have fear'd her had she been a devil.'\n"+
		"With that, all laugh'd and clapp'd him on the shoulder,\n"+
		"Making the bold wag by their praises bolder:\n"+
		"One rubb'd his elbow thus, and fleer'd and swore\n"+
		"A better speech was never spoke before;\n"+
		"Another, with his finger and his thumb,\n"+
		"Cried, 'Via! we will do't, come what will come;'\n"+
		"The third he caper'd, and cried, 'All goes well;'\n"+
		"The fourth turn'd on the toe, and down he fell.\n"+
		"With that, they all did tumble on the ground,\n"+
		"With such a zealous laughter, so profound,\n"+
		"That in this spleen ridiculous appears,\n"+
		"To cheque their folly, passion's solemn tears.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"But what, but what, come they to visit us?\n"+
		"BOYET\n"+
		"They do, they do: and are apparell'd thus.\n"+
		"Like Muscovites or Russians, as I guess.\n"+
		"Their purpose is to parle, to court and dance;\n"+
		"And every one his love-feat will advance\n"+
		"Unto his several mistress, which they'll know\n"+
		"By favours several which they did bestow.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"And will they so? the gallants shall be task'd;\n"+
		"For, ladies, we shall every one be mask'd;\n"+
		"And not a man of them shall have the grace,\n"+
		"Despite of suit, to see a lady's face.\n"+
		"Hold, Rosaline, this favour thou shalt wear,\n"+
		"And then the king will court thee for his dear;\n"+
		"Hold, take thou this, my sweet, and give me thine,\n"+
		"So shall Biron take me for Rosaline.\n"+
		"And change your favours too; so shall your loves\n"+
		"Woo contrary, deceived by these removes.\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"Come on, then; wear the favours most in sight.\n"+
		"KATHARINE\n"+
		"But in this changing what is your intent?\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"The effect of my intent is to cross theirs:\n"+
		"They do it but in mocking merriment;\n"+
		"And mock for mock is only my intent.\n"+
		"Their several counsels they unbosom shall\n"+
		"To loves mistook, and so be mock'd withal\n"+
		"Upon the next occasion that we meet,\n"+
		"With visages displayed, to talk and greet.\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"But shall we dance, if they desire to't?\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"No, to the death, we will not move a foot;\n"+
		"Nor to their penn'd speech render we no grace,\n"+
		"But while 'tis spoke each turn away her face.\n"+
		"BOYET\n"+
		"Why, that contempt will kill the speaker's heart,\n"+
		"And quite divorce his memory from his part.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"Therefore I do it; and I make no doubt\n"+
		"The rest will ne'er come in, if he be out\n"+
		"There's no such sport as sport by sport o'erthrown,\n"+
		"To make theirs ours and ours none but our own:\n"+
		"So shall we stay, mocking intended game,\n"+
		"And they, well mock'd, depart away with shame.\n"+
		"Trumpets sound within\n"+
		"BOYET\n"+
		"The trumpet sounds: be mask'd; the maskers come.\n"+
		"The Ladies mask\n"+
		"Enter Blackamoors with music; MOTH; FERDINAND, BIRON, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN, in Russian habits, and masked\n"+
		"MOTH\n"+
		"All hail, the richest beauties on the earth!--\n"+
		"BOYET\n"+
		"Beauties no richer than rich taffeta.\n"+
		"MOTH\n"+
		"A holy parcel of the fairest dames.\n"+
		"The Ladies turn their backs to him\n"+
		"That ever turn'd their--backs--to mortal views!\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"[Aside to MOTH] Their eyes, villain, their eyes!\n"+
		"MOTH\n"+
		"That ever turn'd their eyes to mortal views!--Out--\n"+
		"BOYET\n"+
		"True; out indeed.\n"+
		"MOTH\n"+
		"Out of your favours, heavenly spirits, vouchsafe\n"+
		"Not to behold--\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"[Aside to MOTH] Once to behold, rogue.\n"+
		"MOTH\n"+
		"Once to behold with your sun-beamed eyes,\n"+
		"--with your sun-beamed eyes--\n"+
		"BOYET\n"+
		"They will not answer to that epithet;\n"+
		"You were best call it 'daughter-beamed eyes.'\n"+
		"MOTH\n"+
		"They do not mark me, and that brings me out.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"Is this your perfectness? be gone, you rogue!\n"+
		"Exit MOTH\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"What would these strangers? know their minds, Boyet:\n"+
		"If they do speak our language, 'tis our will:\n"+
		"That some plain man recount their purposes\n"+
		"Know what they would.\n"+
		"BOYET\n"+
		"What would you with the princess?\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"What would they, say they?\n"+
		"BOYET\n"+
		"Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"Why, that they have; and bid them so be gone.\n"+
		"BOYET\n"+
		"She says, you have it, and you may be gone.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"Say to her, we have measured many miles\n"+
		"To tread a measure with her on this grass.\n"+
		"BOYET\n"+
		"They say, that they have measured many a mile\n"+
		"To tread a measure with you on this grass.\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"It is not so. Ask them how many inches\n"+
		"Is in one mile: if they have measured many,\n"+
		"The measure then of one is easily told.\n"+
		"BOYET\n"+
		"If to come hither you have measured miles,\n"+
		"And many miles, the princess bids you tell\n"+
		"How many inches doth fill up one mile.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"Tell her, we measure them by weary steps.\n"+
		"BOYET\n"+
		"She hears herself.\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"How many weary steps,\n"+
		"Of many weary miles you have o'ergone,\n"+
		"Are number'd in the travel of one mile?\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"We number nothing that we spend for you:\n"+
		"Our duty is so rich, so infinite,\n"+
		"That we may do it still without accompt.\n"+
		"Vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face,\n"+
		"That we, like savages, may worship it.\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"My face is but a moon, and clouded too.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"Blessed are clouds, to do as such clouds do!\n"+
		"Vouchsafe, bright moon, and these thy stars, to shine,\n"+
		"Those clouds removed, upon our watery eyne.\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"O vain petitioner! beg a greater matter;\n"+
		"Thou now request'st but moonshine in the water.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"Then, in our measure do but vouchsafe one change.\n"+
		"Thou bid'st me beg: this begging is not strange.\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"Play, music, then! Nay, you must do it soon.\n"+
		"Music plays\n"+
		"Not yet! no dance! Thus change I like the moon.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"Will you not dance? How come you thus estranged?\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"You took the moon at full, but now she's changed.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"Yet still she is the moon, and I the man.\n"+
		"The music plays; vouchsafe some motion to it.\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"Our ears vouchsafe it.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"But your legs should do it.\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"Since you are strangers and come here by chance,\n"+
		"We'll not be nice: take hands. We will not dance.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"Why take we hands, then?\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"Only to part friends:\n"+
		"Curtsy, sweet hearts; and so the measure ends.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"More measure of this measure; be not nice.\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"We can afford no more at such a price.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"Prize you yourselves: what buys your company?\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"Your absence only.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"That can never be.\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"Then cannot we be bought: and so, adieu;\n"+
		"Twice to your visor, and half once to you.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"If you deny to dance, let's hold more chat.\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"In private, then.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"I am best pleased with that.\n"+
		"They converse apart\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"White-handed mistress, one sweet word with thee.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"Honey, and milk, and sugar; there is three.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"Nay then, two treys, and if you grow so nice,\n"+
		"Metheglin, wort, and malmsey: well run, dice!\n"+
		"There's half-a-dozen sweets.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"Seventh sweet, adieu:\n"+
		"Since you can cog, I'll play no more with you.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"One word in secret.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"Let it not be sweet.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"Thou grievest my gall.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"Gall! bitter.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"Therefore meet.\n"+
		"They converse apart\n"+
		"DUMAIN\n"+
		"Will you vouchsafe with me to change a word?\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"Name it.\n"+
		"DUMAIN\n"+
		"Fair lady,--\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"Say you so? Fair lord,--\n"+
		"Take that for your fair lady.\n"+
		"DUMAIN\n"+
		"Please it you,\n"+
		"As much in private, and I'll bid adieu.\n"+
		"They converse apart\n"+
		"KATHARINE\n"+
		"What, was your vizard made without a tongue?\n"+
		"LONGAVILLE\n"+
		"I know the reason, lady, why you ask.\n"+
		"KATHARINE\n"+
		"O for your reason! quickly, sir; I long.\n"+
		"LONGAVILLE\n"+
		"You have a double tongue within your mask,\n"+
		"And would afford my speechless vizard half.\n"+
		"KATHARINE\n"+
		"Veal, quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf?\n"+
		"LONGAVILLE\n"+
		"A calf, fair lady!\n"+
		"KATHARINE\n"+
		"No, a fair lord calf.\n"+
		"LONGAVILLE\n"+
		"Let's part the word.\n"+
		"KATHARINE\n"+
		"No, I'll not be your half\n"+
		"Take all, and wean it; it may prove an ox.\n"+
		"LONGAVILLE\n"+
		"Look, how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks!\n"+
		"Will you give horns, chaste lady? do not so.\n"+
		"KATHARINE\n"+
		"Then die a calf, before your horns do grow.\n"+
		"LONGAVILLE\n"+
		"One word in private with you, ere I die.\n"+
		"KATHARINE\n"+
		"Bleat softly then; the butcher hears you cry.\n"+
		"They converse apart\n"+
		"BOYET\n"+
		"The tongues of mocking wenches are as keen\n"+
		"As is the razor's edge invisible,\n"+
		"Cutting a smaller hair than may be seen,\n"+
		"Above the sense of sense; so sensible\n"+
		"Seemeth their conference; their conceits have wings\n"+
		"Fleeter than arrows, bullets, wind, thought, swifter things.\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"Not one word more, my maids; break off, break off.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"By heaven, all dry-beaten with pure scoff!\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"Farewell, mad wenches; you have simple wits.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"Twenty adieus, my frozen Muscovits.\n"+
		"Exeunt FERDINAND, Lords, and Blackamoors\n"+
		"Are these the breed of wits so wonder'd at?\n"+
		"BOYET\n"+
		"Tapers they are, with your sweet breaths puff'd out.\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"Well-liking wits they have; gross, gross; fat, fat.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"O poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout!\n"+
		"Will they not, think you, hang themselves tonight?\n"+
		"Or ever, but in vizards, show their faces?\n"+
		"This pert Biron was out of countenance quite.\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"O, they were all in lamentable cases!\n"+
		"The king was weeping-ripe for a good word.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"Biron did swear himself out of all suit.\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"Dumain was at my service, and his sword:\n"+
		"No point, quoth I; my servant straight was mute.\n"+
		"KATHARINE\n"+
		"Lord Longaville said, I came o'er his heart;\n"+
		"And trow you what he called me?\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"Qualm, perhaps.\n"+
		"KATHARINE\n"+
		"Yes, in good faith.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"Go, sickness as thou art!\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"Well, better wits have worn plain statute-caps.\n"+
		"But will you hear? the king is my love sworn.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"And quick Biron hath plighted faith to me.\n"+
		"KATHARINE\n"+
		"And Longaville was for my service born.\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"Dumain is mine, as sure as bark on tree.\n"+
		"BOYET\n"+
		"Madam, and pretty mistresses, give ear:\n"+
		"Immediately they will again be here\n"+
		"In their own shapes; for it can never be\n"+
		"They will digest this harsh indignity.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"Will they return?\n"+
		"BOYET\n"+
		"They will, they will, God knows,\n"+
		"And leap for joy, though they are lame with blows:\n"+
		"Therefore change favours; and, when they repair,\n"+
		"Blow like sweet roses in this summer air.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"How blow? how blow? speak to be understood.\n"+
		"BOYET\n"+
		"Fair ladies mask'd are roses in their bud;\n"+
		"Dismask'd, their damask sweet commixture shown,\n"+
		"Are angels vailing clouds, or roses blown.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"Avaunt, perplexity! What shall we do,\n"+
		"If they return in their own shapes to woo?\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"Good madam, if by me you'll be advised,\n"+
		"Let's, mock them still, as well known as disguised:\n"+
		"Let us complain to them what fools were here,\n"+
		"Disguised like Muscovites, in shapeless gear;\n"+
		"And wonder what they were and to what end\n"+
		"Their shallow shows and prologue vilely penn'd\n"+
		"And their rough carriage so ridiculous,\n"+
		"Should be presented at our tent to us.\n"+
		"BOYET\n"+
		"Ladies, withdraw: the gallants are at hand.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"Whip to our tents, as roes run o'er land.\n"+
		"Exeunt PRINCESS, ROSALINE, KATHARINE, and MARIA\n"+
		"Re-enter FERDINAND, BIRON, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN, in their proper habits\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"Fair sir, God save you! Where's the princess?\n"+
		"BOYET\n"+
		"Gone to her tent. Please it your majesty\n"+
		"Command me any service to her thither?\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"That she vouchsafe me audience for one word.\n"+
		"BOYET\n"+
		"I will; and so will she, I know, my lord.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"This fellow pecks up wit as pigeons pease,\n"+
		"And utters it again when God doth please:\n"+
		"He is wit's pedler, and retails his wares\n"+
		"At wakes and wassails, meetings, markets, fairs;\n"+
		"And we that sell by gross, the Lord doth know,\n"+
		"Have not the grace to grace it with such show.\n"+
		"This gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve;\n"+
		"Had he been Adam, he had tempted Eve;\n"+
		"A' can carve too, and lisp: why, this is he\n"+
		"That kiss'd his hand away in courtesy;\n"+
		"This is the ape of form, monsieur the nice,\n"+
		"That, when he plays at tables, chides the dice\n"+
		"In honourable terms: nay, he can sing\n"+
		"A mean most meanly; and in ushering\n"+
		"Mend him who can: the ladies call him sweet;\n"+
		"The stairs, as he treads on them, kiss his feet:\n"+
		"This is the flower that smiles on every one,\n"+
		"To show his teeth as white as whale's bone;\n"+
		"And consciences, that will not die in debt,\n"+
		"Pay him the due of honey-tongued Boyet.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"A blister on his sweet tongue, with my heart,\n"+
		"That put Armado's page out of his part!\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"See where it comes! Behavior, what wert thou\n"+
		"Till this madman show'd thee? and what art thou now?\n"+
		"Re-enter the PRINCESS, ushered by BOYET, ROSALINE, MARIA, and KATHARINE\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"All hail, sweet madam, and fair time of day!\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"'Fair' in 'all hail' is foul, as I conceive.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"Construe my speeches better, if you may.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"Then wish me better; I will give you leave.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"We came to visit you, and purpose now\n"+
		"To lead you to our court; vouchsafe it then.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"This field shall hold me; and so hold your vow:\n"+
		"Nor God, nor I, delights in perjured men.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"Rebuke me not for that which you provoke:\n"+
		"The virtue of your eye must break my oath.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"You nickname virtue; vice you should have spoke;\n"+
		"For virtue's office never breaks men's troth.\n"+
		"Now by my maiden honour, yet as pure\n"+
		"As the unsullied lily, I protest,\n"+
		"A world of torments though I should endure,\n"+
		"I would not yield to be your house's guest;\n"+
		"So much I hate a breaking cause to be\n"+
		"Of heavenly oaths, vow'd with integrity.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"O, you have lived in desolation here,\n"+
		"Unseen, unvisited, much to our shame.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"Not so, my lord; it is not so, I swear;\n"+
		"We have had pastimes here and pleasant game:\n"+
		"A mess of Russians left us but of late.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"How, madam! Russians!\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"Ay, in truth, my lord;\n"+
		"Trim gallants, full of courtship and of state.\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"Madam, speak true. It is not so, my lord:\n"+
		"My lady, to the manner of the days,\n"+
		"In courtesy gives undeserving praise.\n"+
		"We four indeed confronted were with four\n"+
		"In Russian habit: here they stay'd an hour,\n"+
		"And talk'd apace; and in that hour, my lord,\n"+
		"They did not bless us with one happy word.\n"+
		"I dare not call them fools; but this I think,\n"+
		"When they are thirsty, fools would fain have drink.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"This jest is dry to me. Fair gentle sweet,\n"+
		"Your wit makes wise things foolish: when we greet,\n"+
		"With eyes best seeing, heaven's fiery eye,\n"+
		"By light we lose light: your capacity\n"+
		"Is of that nature that to your huge store\n"+
		"Wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor.\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"This proves you wise and rich, for in my eye,--\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"I am a fool, and full of poverty.\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"But that you take what doth to you belong,\n"+
		"It were a fault to snatch words from my tongue.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"O, I am yours, and all that I possess!\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"All the fool mine?\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"I cannot give you less.\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"Which of the vizards was it that you wore?\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"Where? when? what vizard? why demand you this?\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"There, then, that vizard; that superfluous case\n"+
		"That hid the worse and show'd the better face.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"We are descried; they'll mock us now downright.\n"+
		"DUMAIN\n"+
		"Let us confess and turn it to a jest.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"Amazed, my lord? why looks your highness sad?\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"Help, hold his brows! he'll swoon! Why look you pale?\n"+
		"Sea-sick, I think, coming from Muscovy.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"Thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury.\n"+
		"Can any face of brass hold longer out?\n"+
		"Here stand I\n"+
		"lady, dart thy skill at me;\n"+
		"Bruise me with scorn, confound me with a flout;\n"+
		"Thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance;\n"+
		"Cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit;\n"+
		"And I will wish thee never more to dance,\n"+
		"Nor never more in Russian habit wait.\n"+
		"O, never will I trust to speeches penn'd,\n"+
		"Nor to the motion of a schoolboy's tongue,\n"+
		"Nor never come in vizard to my friend,\n"+
		"Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper's song!\n"+
		"Taffeta phrases, silken terms precise,\n"+
		"Three-piled hyperboles, spruce affectation,\n"+
		"Figures pedantical; these summer-flies\n"+
		"Have blown me full of maggot ostentation:\n"+
		"I do forswear them; and I here protest,\n"+
		"By this white glove;--how white the hand, God knows!--\n"+
		"Henceforth my wooing mind shall be express'd\n"+
		"In russet yeas and honest kersey noes:\n"+
		"And, to begin, wench,--so God help me, la!--\n"+
		"My love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw.\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"Sans sans, I pray you.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"Yet I have a trick\n"+
		"Of the old rage: bear with me, I am sick;\n"+
		"I'll leave it by degrees. Soft, let us see:\n"+
		"Write, 'Lord have mercy on us' on those three;\n"+
		"They are infected; in their hearts it lies;\n"+
		"They have the plague, and caught it of your eyes;\n"+
		"These lords are visited; you are not free,\n"+
		"For the Lord's tokens on you do I see.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"No, they are free that gave these tokens to us.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"Our states are forfeit: seek not to undo us.\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"It is not so; for how can this be true,\n"+
		"That you stand forfeit, being those that sue?\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"Peace! for I will not have to do with you.\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"Nor shall not, if I do as I intend.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"Speak for yourselves; my wit is at an end.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"Teach us, sweet madam, for our rude transgression\n"+
		"Some fair excuse.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"The fairest is confession.\n"+
		"Were not you here but even now disguised?\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"Madam, I was.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"And were you well advised?\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"I was, fair madam.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"When you then were here,\n"+
		"What did you whisper in your lady's ear?\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"That more than all the world I did respect her.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"When she shall challenge this, you will reject her.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"Upon mine honour, no.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"Peace, peace! forbear:\n"+
		"Your oath once broke, you force not to forswear.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"Despise me, when I break this oath of mine.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"I will: and therefore keep it. Rosaline,\n"+
		"What did the Russian whisper in your ear?\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"Madam, he swore that he did hold me dear\n"+
		"As precious eyesight, and did value me\n"+
		"Above this world; adding thereto moreover\n"+
		"That he would wed me, or else die my lover.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"God give thee joy of him! the noble lord\n"+
		"Most honourably doth unhold his word.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"What mean you, madam? by my life, my troth,\n"+
		"I never swore this lady such an oath.\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"By heaven, you did; and to confirm it plain,\n"+
		"You gave me this: but take it, sir, again.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"My faith and this the princess I did give:\n"+
		"I knew her by this jewel on her sleeve.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"Pardon me, sir, this jewel did she wear;\n"+
		"And Lord Biron, I thank him, is my dear.\n"+
		"What, will you have me, or your pearl again?\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"Neither of either; I remit both twain.\n"+
		"I see the trick on't: here was a consent,\n"+
		"Knowing aforehand of our merriment,\n"+
		"To dash it like a Christmas comedy:\n"+
		"Some carry-tale, some please-man, some slight zany,\n"+
		"Some mumble-news, some trencher-knight, some Dick,\n"+
		"That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick\n"+
		"To make my lady laugh when she's disposed,\n"+
		"Told our intents before; which once disclosed,\n"+
		"The ladies did change favours: and then we,\n"+
		"Following the signs, woo'd but the sign of she.\n"+
		"Now, to our perjury to add more terror,\n"+
		"We are again forsworn, in will and error.\n"+
		"Much upon this it is: and might not you\n"+

		"COSTARD\n"+
		"Under correction, sir, we know whereuntil it doth amount.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"By Jove, I always took three threes for nine.\n"+
		"COSTARD\n"+
		"O Lord, sir, it were pity you should get your living\n"+

		"BIRON\n"+
		"How much is it?\n"+
		"COSTARD\n"+
		"O Lord, sir, the parties themselves, the actors,\n"+

		"Out of a new-sad soul, that you vouchsafe\n"+
		"In your rich wisdom to excuse or hide\n"+
		"The liberal opposition of our spirits,\n"+
		"If over-boldly we have borne ourselves\n"+
		"In the converse of breath: your gentleness\n"+
		"Was guilty of it. Farewell worthy lord!\n"+
		"A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue:\n"+

		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"The extreme parts of time extremely forms\n"+
		"All causes to the purpose of his speed,\n"+

		"Forbid the smiling courtesy of love\n"+
		"The holy suit which fain it would convince,\n"+
		"Yet, since love's argument was first on foot,\n"+
		"Let not the cloud of sorrow justle it\n"+
		"From what it purposed; since, to wail friends lost\n"+

		"I understand you not: my griefs are double.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief;\n"+
		"And by these badges understand the king.\n"+

		"Play'd foul play with our oaths: your beauty, ladies,\n"+
		"Hath much deform'd us, fashioning our humours\n"+
		"Even to the opposed end of our intents:\n"+
		"And what in us hath seem'd ridiculous,--\n"+
		"As love is full of unbefitting strains,\n"+
		"All wanton as a child, skipping and vain,\n"+
		"Form'd by the eye and therefore, like the eye,\n"+
		"Full of strange shapes, of habits and of forms,\n"+
		"Varying in subjects as the eye doth roll\n"+
		"To every varied object in his glance:\n"+
		"Which parti-coated presence of loose love\n"+
		"Put on by us, if, in your heavenly eyes,\n"+
		"Have misbecomed our oaths and gravities,\n"+
		"Those heavenly eyes, that look into these faults,\n"+
		"Suggested us to make. Therefore, ladies,\n"+
		"Our love being yours, the error that love makes\n"+
		"Is likewise yours: we to ourselves prove false,\n"+
		"By being once false for ever to be true\n"+
		"To those that make us both,--fair ladies, you:\n"+
		"And even that falsehood, in itself a sin,\n"+
		"Thus purifies itself and turns to grace.\n"+
		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"We have received your letters full of love;\n"+
		"Your favours, the ambassadors of love;\n"+
		"And, in our maiden council, rated them\n"+
		"At courtship, pleasant jest and courtesy,\n"+
		"As bombast and as lining to the time:\n"+
		"But more devout than this in our respects\n"+
		"Have we not been; and therefore met your loves\n"+
		"In their own fashion, like a merriment.\n"+
		"DUMAIN\n"+
		"Our letters, madam, show'd much more than jest.\n"+
		"LONGAVILLE\n"+
		"So did our looks.\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"We did not quote them so.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"Now, at the latest minute of the hour,\n"+

		"PRINCESS\n"+
		"A time, methinks, too short\n"+
		"To make a world-without-end bargain in.\n"+
		"No, no, my lord, your grace is perjured much,\n"+
		"Full of dear guiltiness; and therefore this:\n"+
		"If for my love, as there is no such cause,\n"+
		"You will do aught, this shall you do for me:\n"+
		"Your oath I will not trust; but go with speed\n"+
		"To some forlorn and naked hermitage,\n"+
		"Remote from all the pleasures of the world;\n"+
		"There stay until the twelve celestial signs\n"+
		"Have brought about the annual reckoning.\n"+
		"If this austere insociable life\n"+
		"Change not your offer made in heat of blood;\n"+
		"If frosts and fasts, hard lodging and thin weeds\n"+
		"Nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love,\n"+
		"But that it bear this trial and last love;\n"+
		"Then, at the expiration of the year,\n"+
		"Come challenge me, challenge me by these deserts,\n"+
		"And, by this virgin palm now kissing thine\n"+
		"I will be thine; and till that instant shut\n"+
		"My woeful self up in a mourning house,\n"+
		"Raining the tears of lamentation\n"+
		"For the remembrance of my father's death.\n"+
		"If this thou do deny, let our hands part,\n"+
		"Neither entitled in the other's heart.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"If this, or more than this, I would deny,\n"+
		"To flatter up these powers of mine with rest,\n"+
		"The sudden hand of death close up mine eye!\n"+
		"Hence ever then my heart is in thy breast.\n"+
		"DUMAIN\n"+
		"But what to me, my love? but what to me? A wife?\n"+
		"KATHARINE\n"+
		"A beard, fair health, and honesty;\n"+
		"With three-fold love I wish you all these three.\n"+
		"DUMAIN\n"+
		"O, shall I say, I thank you, gentle wife?\n"+
		"KATHARINE\n"+
		"Not so, my lord; a twelvemonth and a day\n"+
		"I'll mark no words that smooth-faced wooers say:\n"+
		"Come when the king doth to my lady come;\n"+
		"Then, if I have much love, I'll give you some.\n"+
		"DUMAIN\n"+
		"I'll serve thee true and faithfully till then.\n"+
		"KATHARINE\n"+
		"Yet swear not, lest ye be forsworn again.\n"+
		"LONGAVILLE\n"+
		"What says Maria?\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"At the twelvemonth's end\n"+
		"I'll change my black gown for a faithful friend.\n"+
		"LONGAVILLE\n"+
		"I'll stay with patience; but the time is long.\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"The liker you; few taller are so young.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"Studies my lady? mistress, look on me;\n"+
		"Behold the window of my heart, mine eye,\n"+
		"What humble suit attends thy answer there:\n"+
		"Impose some service on me for thy love.\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"Oft have I heard of you, my Lord Biron,\n"+
		"Before I saw you; and the world's large tongue\n"+
		"Proclaims you for a man replete with mocks,\n"+
		"Full of comparisons and wounding flouts,\n"+
		"Which you on all estates will execute\n"+
		"That lie within the mercy of your wit.\n"+
		"To weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain,\n"+
		"And therewithal to win me, if you please,\n"+
		"Without the which I am not to be won,\n"+
		"You shall this twelvemonth term from day to day\n"+
		"Visit the speechless sick and still converse\n"+
		"With groaning wretches; and your task shall be,\n"+
		"With all the fierce endeavor of your wit\n"+
		"To enforce the pained impotent to smile.\n"+
		"BIRON\n"+
		"To move wild laughter in the throat of death?\n"+
		"It cannot be; it is impossible:\n"+
		"Mirth cannot move a soul in agony.\n"+
		"ROSALINE\n"+
		"Why, that's the way to choke a gibing spirit,\n"+
		"Whose influence is begot of that loose grace\n"+
		"Which shallow laughing hearers give to fools:\n"+
