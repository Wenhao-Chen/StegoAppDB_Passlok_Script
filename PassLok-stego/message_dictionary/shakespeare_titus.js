		"ACT I\n"+
		"SCENE I. Rome. Before the Capitol.\n"+
		"The Tomb of the ANDRONICI appearing; the Tribunes and Senators aloft. Enter, below, from one side, SATURNINUS and his Followers; and, from the other side, BASSIANUS and his Followers; with drum and colours\n"+
		"SATURNINUS\n"+
		"Noble patricians, patrons of my right,\n"+
		"Defend the justice of my cause with arms,\n"+
		"And, countrymen, my loving followers,\n"+
		"Plead my successive title with your swords:\n"+
		"I am his first-born son, that was the last\n"+
		"That wore the imperial diadem of Rome;\n"+
		"Then let my father's honours live in me,\n"+
		"Nor wrong mine age with this indignity.\n"+
		"BASSIANUS\n"+
		"Romans, friends, followers, favorers of my right,\n"+
		"If ever Bassianus, Caesar's son,\n"+
		"Were gracious in the eyes of royal Rome,\n"+
		"Keep then this passage to the Capitol\n"+
		"And suffer not dishonour to approach\n"+
		"The imperial seat, to virtue consecrate,\n"+
		"To justice, continence and nobility;\n"+
		"But let desert in pure election shine,\n"+
		"And, Romans, fight for freedom in your choice.\n"+
		"Enter MARCUS ANDRONICUS, aloft, with the crown\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Princes, that strive by factions and by friends\n"+
		"Ambitiously for rule and empery,\n"+
		"Know that the people of Rome, for whom we stand\n"+
		"A special party, have, by common voice,\n"+
		"In election for the Roman empery,\n"+
		"Chosen Andronicus, surnamed Pius\n"+
		"For many good and great deserts to Rome:\n"+
		"A nobler man, a braver warrior,\n"+
		"Lives not this day within the city walls:\n"+
		"He by the senate is accit'd home\n"+
		"From weary wars against the barbarous Goths;\n"+
		"That, with his sons, a terror to our foes,\n"+
		"Hath yoked a nation strong, train'd up in arms.\n"+
		"Ten years are spent since first he undertook\n"+
		"This cause of Rome and chastised with arms\n"+
		"Our enemies' pride: five times he hath return'd\n"+
		"Bleeding to Rome, bearing his valiant sons\n"+
		"In coffins from the field;\n"+
		"And now at last, laden with horror's spoils,\n"+
		"Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,\n"+
		"Renowned Titus, flourishing in arms.\n"+
		"Let us entreat, by honour of his name,\n"+
		"Whom worthily you would have now succeed.\n"+
		"And in the Capitol and senate's right,\n"+
		"Whom you pretend to honour and adore,\n"+
		"That you withdraw you and abate your strength;\n"+
		"Dismiss your followers and, as suitors should,\n"+
		"Plead your deserts in peace and humbleness.\n"+
		"SATURNINUS\n"+
		"How fair the tribune speaks to calm my thoughts!\n"+
		"BASSIANUS\n"+
		"Marcus Andronicus, so I do ally\n"+
		"In thy uprightness and integrity,\n"+
		"And so I love and honour thee and thine,\n"+
		"Thy noble brother Titus and his sons,\n"+
		"And her to whom my thoughts are humbled all,\n"+
		"Gracious Lavinia, Rome's rich ornament,\n"+
		"That I will here dismiss my loving friends,\n"+
		"And to my fortunes and the people's favor\n"+
		"Commit my cause in balance to be weigh'd.\n"+
		"Exeunt the followers of BASSIANUS\n"+
		"SATURNINUS\n"+
		"Friends, that have been thus forward in my right,\n"+
		"I thank you all and here dismiss you all,\n"+
		"And to the love and favor of my country\n"+
		"Commit myself, my person and the cause.\n"+
		"Exeunt the followers of SATURNINUS\n"+
		"Rome, be as just and gracious unto me\n"+
		"As I am confident and kind to thee.\n"+
		"Open the gates, and let me in.\n"+
		"BASSIANUS\n"+
		"Tribunes, and me, a poor competitor.\n"+
		"Flourish. SATURNINUS and BASSIANUS go up into the Capitol\n"+
		"Enter a Captain\n"+
		"Captain\n"+
		"Romans, make way: the good Andronicus.\n"+
		"Patron of virtue, Rome's best champion,\n"+
		"Successful in the battles that he fights,\n"+
		"With honour and with fortune is return'd\n"+
		"From where he circumscribed with his sword,\n"+
		"And brought to yoke, the enemies of Rome.\n"+
		"Drums and trumpets sounded. Enter MARTIUS and MUTIUS; After them, two Men bearing a coffin covered with black; then LUCIUS and QUINTUS. After them, TITUS ANDRONICUS; and then TAMORA, with ALARBUS, DEMETRIUS, CHIRON, AARON, and other Goths, prisoners; Soldiers and people following. The Bearers set down the coffin, and TITUS speaks\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Hail, Rome, victorious in thy mourning weeds!\n"+
		"Lo, as the bark, that hath discharged her fraught,\n"+
		"Returns with precious jading to the bay\n"+
		"From whence at first she weigh'd her anchorage,\n"+
		"Cometh Andronicus, bound with laurel boughs,\n"+
		"To re-salute his country with his tears,\n"+
		"Tears of true joy for his return to Rome.\n"+
		"Thou great defender of this Capitol,\n"+
		"Stand gracious to the rites that we intend!\n"+
		"Romans, of five and twenty valiant sons,\n"+
		"Half of the number that King Priam had,\n"+
		"Behold the poor remains, alive and dead!\n"+
		"These that survive let Rome reward with love;\n"+
		"These that I bring unto their latest home,\n"+
		"With burial amongst their ancestors:\n"+
		"Here Goths have given me leave to sheathe my sword.\n"+
		"Titus, unkind and careless of thine own,\n"+
		"Why suffer'st thou thy sons, unburied yet,\n"+
		"To hover on the dreadful shore of Styx?\n"+
		"Make way to lay them by their brethren.\n"+
		"The tomb is opened\n"+
		"There greet in silence, as the dead are wont,\n"+
		"And sleep in peace, slain in your country's wars!\n"+
		"O sacred receptacle of my joys,\n"+
		"Sweet cell of virtue and nobility,\n"+
		"How many sons of mine hast thou in store,\n"+
		"That thou wilt never render to me more!\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"Give us the proudest prisoner of the Goths,\n"+
		"That we may hew his limbs, and on a pile\n"+
		"Ad manes fratrum sacrifice his flesh,\n"+
		"Before this earthy prison of their bones;\n"+
		"That so the shadows be not unappeased,\n"+
		"Nor we disturb'd with prodigies on earth.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"I give him you, the noblest that survives,\n"+
		"The eldest son of this distressed queen.\n"+
		"TAMORA\n"+
		"Stay, Roman brethren! Gracious conqueror,\n"+
		"Victorious Titus, rue the tears I shed,\n"+
		"A mother's tears in passion for her son:\n"+
		"And if thy sons were ever dear to thee,\n"+
		"O, think my son to be as dear to me!\n"+
		"Sufficeth not that we are brought to Rome,\n"+
		"To beautify thy triumphs and return,\n"+
		"Captive to thee and to thy Roman yoke,\n"+
		"But must my sons be slaughter'd in the streets,\n"+
		"For valiant doings in their country's cause?\n"+
		"O, if to fight for king and commonweal\n"+
		"Were piety in thine, it is in these.\n"+
		"Andronicus, stain not thy tomb with blood:\n"+
		"Wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods?\n"+
		"Draw near them then in being merciful:\n"+
		"Sweet mercy is nobility's true badge:\n"+
		"Thrice noble Titus, spare my first-born son.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Patient yourself, madam, and pardon me.\n"+
		"These are their brethren, whom you Goths beheld\n"+
		"Alive and dead, and for their brethren slain\n"+
		"Religiously they ask a sacrifice:\n"+
		"To this your son is mark'd, and die he must,\n"+
		"To appease their groaning shadows that are gone.\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"Away with him! and make a fire straight;\n"+
		"And with our swords, upon a pile of wood,\n"+
		"Let's hew his limbs till they be clean consumed.\n"+
		"Exeunt LUCIUS, QUINTUS, MARTIUS, and MUTIUS, with ALARBUS\n"+
		"TAMORA\n"+
		"O cruel, irreligious piety!\n"+
		"CHIRON\n"+
		"Was ever Scythia half so barbarous?\n"+
		"DEMETRIUS\n"+
		"Oppose not Scythia to ambitious Rome.\n"+
		"Alarbus goes to rest; and we survive\n"+
		"To tremble under Titus' threatening looks.\n"+
		"Then, madam, stand resolved, but hope withal\n"+
		"The self-same gods that arm'd the Queen of Troy\n"+
		"With opportunity of sharp revenge\n"+
		"Upon the Thracian tyrant in his tent,\n"+
		"May favor Tamora, the Queen of Goths--\n"+
		"When Goths were Goths and Tamora was queen--\n"+
		"To quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes.\n"+
		"Re-enter LUCIUS, QUINTUS, MARTIUS and MUTIUS, with their swords bloody\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"See, lord and father, how we have perform'd\n"+
		"Our Roman rites: Alarbus' limbs are lopp'd,\n"+
		"And entrails feed the sacrificing fire,\n"+
		"Whose smoke, like incense, doth perfume the sky.\n"+
		"Remaineth nought, but to inter our brethren,\n"+
		"And with loud 'larums welcome them to Rome.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Let it be so; and let Andronicus\n"+
		"Make this his latest farewell to their souls.\n"+
		"Trumpets sounded, and the coffin laid in the tomb\n"+
		"In peace and honour rest you here, my sons;\n"+
		"Rome's readiest champions, repose you here in rest,\n"+
		"Secure from worldly chances and mishaps!\n"+
		"Here lurks no treason, here no envy swells,\n"+
		"Here grow no damned grudges; here are no storms,\n"+
		"No noise, but silence and eternal sleep:\n"+
		"In peace and honour rest you here, my sons!\n"+
		"Enter LAVINIA\n"+
		"LAVINIA\n"+
		"In peace and honour live Lord Titus long;\n"+
		"My noble lord and father, live in fame!\n"+
		"Lo, at this tomb my tributary tears\n"+
		"I render, for my brethren's obsequies;\n"+
		"And at thy feet I kneel, with tears of joy,\n"+
		"Shed on the earth, for thy return to Rome:\n"+
		"O, bless me here with thy victorious hand,\n"+
		"Whose fortunes Rome's best citizens applaud!\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Kind Rome, that hast thus lovingly reserved\n"+
		"The cordial of mine age to glad my heart!\n"+
		"Lavinia, live; outlive thy father's days,\n"+
		"And fame's eternal date, for virtue's praise!\n"+
		"Enter, below, MARCUS ANDRONICUS and Tribunes; re-enter SATURNINUS and BASSIANUS, attended\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Long live Lord Titus, my beloved brother,\n"+
		"Gracious triumpher in the eyes of Rome!\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Thanks, gentle tribune, noble brother Marcus.\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"And welcome, nephews, from successful wars,\n"+
		"You that survive, and you that sleep in fame!\n"+
		"Fair lords, your fortunes are alike in all,\n"+
		"That in your country's service drew your swords:\n"+
		"But safer triumph is this funeral pomp,\n"+
		"That hath aspired to Solon's happiness\n"+
		"And triumphs over chance in honour's bed.\n"+
		"Titus Andronicus, the people of Rome,\n"+
		"Whose friend in justice thou hast ever been,\n"+
		"Send thee by me, their tribune and their trust,\n"+
		"This palliament of white and spotless hue;\n"+
		"And name thee in election for the empire,\n"+
		"With these our late-deceased emperor's sons:\n"+
		"Be candidatus then, and put it on,\n"+
		"And help to set a head on headless Rome.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"A better head her glorious body fits\n"+
		"Than his that shakes for age and feebleness:\n"+
		"What should I don this robe, and trouble you?\n"+
		"Be chosen with proclamations to-day,\n"+
		"To-morrow yield up rule, resign my life,\n"+
		"And set abroad new business for you all?\n"+
		"Rome, I have been thy soldier forty years,\n"+
		"And led my country's strength successfully,\n"+
		"And buried one and twenty valiant sons,\n"+
		"Knighted in field, slain manfully in arms,\n"+
		"In right and service of their noble country\n"+
		"Give me a staff of honour for mine age,\n"+
		"But not a sceptre to control the world:\n"+
		"Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Titus, thou shalt obtain and ask the empery.\n"+
		"SATURNINUS\n"+
		"Proud and ambitious tribune, canst thou tell?\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Patience, Prince Saturninus.\n"+
		"SATURNINUS\n"+
		"Romans, do me right:\n"+
		"Patricians, draw your swords: and sheathe them not\n"+
		"Till Saturninus be Rome's emperor.\n"+
		"Andronicus, would thou wert shipp'd to hell,\n"+
		"Rather than rob me of the people's hearts!\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"Proud Saturnine, interrupter of the good\n"+
		"That noble-minded Titus means to thee!\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Content thee, prince; I will restore to thee\n"+
		"The people's hearts, and wean them from themselves.\n"+
		"BASSIANUS\n"+
		"Andronicus, I do not flatter thee,\n"+
		"But honour thee, and will do till I die:\n"+
		"My faction if thou strengthen with thy friends,\n"+
		"I will most thankful be; and thanks to men\n"+
		"Of noble minds is honourable meed.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"People of Rome, and people's tribunes here,\n"+
		"I ask your voices and your suffrages:\n"+
		"Will you bestow them friendly on Andronicus?\n"+
		"Tribunes\n"+
		"To gratify the good Andronicus,\n"+
		"And gratulate his safe return to Rome,\n"+
		"The people will accept whom he admits.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Tribunes, I thank you: and this suit I make,\n"+
		"That you create your emperor's eldest son,\n"+
		"Lord Saturnine; whose virtues will, I hope,\n"+
		"Reflect on Rome as Titan's rays on earth,\n"+
		"And ripen justice in this commonweal:\n"+
		"Then, if you will elect by my advice,\n"+
		"Crown him and say 'Long live our emperor!'\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"With voices and applause of every sort,\n"+
		"Patricians and plebeians, we create\n"+
		"Lord Saturninus Rome's great emperor,\n"+
		"And say 'Long live our Emperor Saturnine!'\n"+
		"A long flourish till they come down\n"+
		"SATURNINUS\n"+
		"Titus Andronicus, for thy favors done\n"+
		"To us in our election this day,\n"+
		"I give thee thanks in part of thy deserts,\n"+
		"And will with deeds requite thy gentleness:\n"+
		"And, for an onset, Titus, to advance\n"+
		"Thy name and honourable family,\n"+
		"Lavinia will I make my empress,\n"+
		"Rome's royal mistress, mistress of my heart,\n"+
		"And in the sacred Pantheon her espouse:\n"+
		"Tell me, Andronicus, doth this motion please thee?\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"It doth, my worthy lord; and in this match\n"+
		"I hold me highly honour'd of your grace:\n"+
		"And here in sight of Rome to Saturnine,\n"+
		"King and commander of our commonweal,\n"+
		"The wide world's emperor, do I consecrate\n"+
		"My sword, my chariot and my prisoners;\n"+
		"Presents well worthy Rome's imperial lord:\n"+
		"Receive them then, the tribute that I owe,\n"+
		"Mine honour's ensigns humbled at thy feet.\n"+
		"SATURNINUS\n"+
		"Thanks, noble Titus, father of my life!\n"+
		"How proud I am of thee and of thy gifts\n"+
		"Rome shall record, and when I do forget\n"+
		"The least of these unspeakable deserts,\n"+
		"Romans, forget your fealty to me.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"[To TAMORA] Now, madam, are you prisoner to\n"+
		"an emperor;\n"+
		"To him that, for your honour and your state,\n"+
		"Will use you nobly and your followers.\n"+
		"SATURNINUS\n"+
		"A goodly lady, trust me; of the hue\n"+
		"That I would choose, were I to choose anew.\n"+
		"Clear up, fair queen, that cloudy countenance:\n"+
		"Though chance of war hath wrought this change of cheer,\n"+
		"Thou comest not to be made a scorn in Rome:\n"+
		"Princely shall be thy usage every way.\n"+
		"Rest on my word, and let not discontent\n"+
		"Daunt all your hopes: madam, he comforts you\n"+
		"Can make you greater than the Queen of Goths.\n"+
		"Lavinia, you are not displeased with this?\n"+
		"LAVINIA\n"+
		"Not I, my lord; sith true nobility\n"+
		"Warrants these words in princely courtesy.\n"+
		"SATURNINUS\n"+
		"Thanks, sweet Lavinia. Romans, let us go;\n"+
		"Ransomless here we set our prisoners free:\n"+
		"Proclaim our honours, lords, with trump and drum.\n"+
		"Flourish. SATURNINUS courts TAMORA in dumb show\n"+
		"BASSIANUS\n"+
		"Lord Titus, by your leave, this maid is mine.\n"+
		"Seizing LAVINIA\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"How, sir! are you in earnest then, my lord?\n"+
		"BASSIANUS\n"+
		"Ay, noble Titus; and resolved withal\n"+
		"To do myself this reason and this right.\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"'Suum cuique' is our Roman justice:\n"+
		"This prince in justice seizeth but his own.\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"And that he will, and shall, if Lucius live.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Traitors, avaunt! Where is the emperor's guard?\n"+
		"Treason, my lord! Lavinia is surprised!\n"+
		"SATURNINUS\n"+
		"Surprised! by whom?\n"+
		"BASSIANUS\n"+
		"By him that justly may\n"+
		"Bear his betroth'd from all the world away.\n"+
		"Exeunt BASSIANUS and MARCUS with LAVINIA\n"+
		"MUTIUS\n"+
		"Brothers, help to convey her hence away,\n"+
		"And with my sword I'll keep this door safe.\n"+
		"Exeunt LUCIUS, QUINTUS, and MARTIUS\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Follow, my lord, and I'll soon bring her back.\n"+
		"MUTIUS\n"+
		"My lord, you pass not here.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"What, villain boy!\n"+
		"Barr'st me my way in Rome?\n"+
		"Stabbing MUTIUS\n"+
		"MUTIUS\n"+
		"Help, Lucius, help!\n"+
		"Dies\n"+
		"During the fray, SATURNINUS, TAMORA, DEMETRIUS, CHIRON and AARON go out and re-enter, above\n"+
		"Re-enter LUCIUS\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"My lord, you are unjust, and, more than so,\n"+
		"In wrongful quarrel you have slain your son.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Nor thou, nor he, are any sons of mine;\n"+
		"My sons would never so dishonour me:\n"+
		"Traitor, restore Lavinia to the emperor.\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"Dead, if you will; but not to be his wife,\n"+
		"That is another's lawful promised love.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SATURNINUS\n"+
		"No, Titus, no; the emperor needs her not,\n"+
		"Nor her, nor thee, nor any of thy stock:\n"+
		"I'll trust, by leisure, him that mocks me once;\n"+
		"Thee never, nor thy traitorous haughty sons,\n"+
		"Confederates all thus to dishonour me.\n"+
		"Was there none else in Rome to make a stale,\n"+
		"But Saturnine? Full well, Andronicus,\n"+
		"Agree these deeds with that proud brag of thine,\n"+
		"That said'st I begg'd the empire at thy hands.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"O monstrous! what reproachful words are these?\n"+
		"SATURNINUS\n"+
		"But go thy ways; go, give that changing piece\n"+
		"To him that flourish'd for her with his sword\n"+
		"A valiant son-in-law thou shalt enjoy;\n"+
		"One fit to bandy with thy lawless sons,\n"+
		"To ruffle in the commonwealth of Rome.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"These words are razors to my wounded heart.\n"+
		"SATURNINUS\n"+
		"And therefore, lovely Tamora, queen of Goths,\n"+
		"That like the stately Phoebe 'mongst her nymphs\n"+
		"Dost overshine the gallant'st dames of Rome,\n"+
		"If thou be pleased with this my sudden choice,\n"+
		"Behold, I choose thee, Tamora, for my bride,\n"+
		"And will create thee empress of Rome,\n"+
		"Speak, Queen of Goths, dost thou applaud my choice?\n"+
		"And here I swear by all the Roman gods,\n"+
		"Sith priest and holy water are so near\n"+
		"And tapers burn so bright and every thing\n"+
		"In readiness for Hymenaeus stand,\n"+
		"I will not re-salute the streets of Rome,\n"+
		"Or climb my palace, till from forth this place\n"+
		"I lead espoused my bride along with me.\n"+
		"TAMORA\n"+
		"And here, in sight of heaven, to Rome I swear,\n"+
		"If Saturnine advance the Queen of Goths,\n"+
		"She will a handmaid be to his desires,\n"+
		"A loving nurse, a mother to his youth.\n"+
		"SATURNINUS\n"+
		"Ascend, fair queen, Pantheon. Lords, accompany\n"+
		"Your noble emperor and his lovely bride,\n"+
		"Sent by the heavens for Prince Saturnine,\n"+
		"Whose wisdom hath her fortune conquered:\n"+
		"There shall we consummate our spousal rites.\n"+
		"Exeunt all but TITUS\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"I am not bid to wait upon this bride.\n"+
		"Titus, when wert thou wont to walk alone,\n"+
		"Dishonour'd thus, and challenged of wrongs?\n"+
		"Re-enter MARCUS, LUCIUS, QUINTUS, and MARTIUS\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"O Titus, see, O, see what thou hast done!\n"+
		"In a bad quarrel slain a virtuous son.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"No, foolish tribune, no; no son of mine,\n"+
		"Nor thou, nor these, confederates in the deed\n"+
		"That hath dishonour'd all our family;\n"+
		"Unworthy brother, and unworthy sons!\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"But let us give him burial, as becomes;\n"+
		"Give Mutius burial with our brethren.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Traitors, away! he rests not in this tomb:\n"+
		"This monument five hundred years hath stood,\n"+
		"Which I have sumptuously re-edified:\n"+
		"Here none but soldiers and Rome's servitors\n"+
		"Repose in fame; none basely slain in brawls:\n"+
		"Bury him where you can; he comes not here.\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"My lord, this is impiety in you:\n"+
		"My nephew Mutius' deeds do plead for him\n"+
		"He must be buried with his brethren.\n"+
		"QUINTUS\n"+
		"MARTIUS\n"+
		"And shall, or him we will accompany.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"'And shall!' what villain was it that spake\n"+
		"that word?\n"+
		"QUINTUS\n"+
		"He that would vouch it in any place but here.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"What, would you bury him in my despite?\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"No, noble Titus, but entreat of thee\n"+
		"To pardon Mutius and to bury him.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Marcus, even thou hast struck upon my crest,\n"+
		"And, with these boys, mine honour thou hast wounded:\n"+
		"My foes I do repute you every one;\n"+
		"So, trouble me no more, but get you gone.\n"+
		"MARTIUS\n"+
		"He is not with himself; let us withdraw.\n"+
		"QUINTUS\n"+
		"Not I, till Mutius' bones be buried.\n"+
		"MARCUS and the Sons of TITUS kneel\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Brother, for in that name doth nature plead,--\n"+
		"QUINTUS\n"+
		"Father, and in that name doth nature speak,--\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Speak thou no more, if all the rest will speed.\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Renowned Titus, more than half my soul,--\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"Dear father, soul and substance of us all,--\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Suffer thy brother Marcus to inter\n"+
		"His noble nephew here in virtue's nest,\n"+
		"That died in honour and Lavinia's cause.\n"+
		"Thou art a Roman; be not barbarous:\n"+
		"The Greeks upon advice did bury Ajax\n"+
		"That slew himself; and wise Laertes' son\n"+
		"Did graciously plead for his funerals:\n"+
		"Let not young Mutius, then, that was thy joy\n"+
		"Be barr'd his entrance here.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Rise, Marcus, rise.\n"+
		"The dismall'st day is this that e'er I saw,\n"+
		"To be dishonour'd by my sons in Rome!\n"+
		"Well, bury him, and bury me the next.\n"+
		"MUTIUS is put into the tomb\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"There lie thy bones, sweet Mutius, with thy friends,\n"+
		"Till we with trophies do adorn thy tomb.\n"+
		"All\n"+
		"[Kneeling] No man shed tears for noble Mutius;\n"+
		"He lives in fame that died in virtue's cause.\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"My lord, to step out of these dreary dumps,\n"+
		"How comes it that the subtle Queen of Goths\n"+
		"Is of a sudden thus advanced in Rome?\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"I know not, Marcus; but I know it is,\n"+
		"Whether by device or no, the heavens can tell:\n"+
		"Is she not then beholding to the man\n"+
		"That brought her for this high good turn so far?\n"+
		"Yes, and will nobly him remunerate.\n"+
		"Flourish. Re-enter, from one side, SATURNINUS attended, TAMORA, DEMETRIUS, CHIRON and AARON; from the other, BASSIANUS, LAVINIA, and others\n"+
		"SATURNINUS\n"+
		"So, Bassianus, you have play'd your prize:\n"+
		"God give you joy, sir, of your gallant bride!\n"+
		"BASSIANUS\n"+
		"And you of yours, my lord! I say no more,\n"+
		"Nor wish no less; and so, I take my leave.\n"+
		"SATURNINUS\n"+
		"Traitor, if Rome have law or we have power,\n"+
		"Thou and thy faction shall repent this rape.\n"+
		"BASSIANUS\n"+
		"Rape, call you it, my lord, to seize my own,\n"+
		"My truth-betrothed love and now my wife?\n"+
		"But let the laws of Rome determine all;\n"+
		"Meanwhile I am possess'd of that is mine.\n"+
		"SATURNINUS\n"+
		"'Tis good, sir: you are very short with us;\n"+
		"But, if we live, we'll be as sharp with you.\n"+
		"BASSIANUS\n"+
		"My lord, what I have done, as best I may,\n"+
		"Answer I must and shall do with my life.\n"+
		"Only thus much I give your grace to know:\n"+
		"By all the duties that I owe to Rome,\n"+
		"This noble gentleman, Lord Titus here,\n"+
		"Is in opinion and in honour wrong'd;\n"+
		"That in the rescue of Lavinia\n"+
		"With his own hand did slay his youngest son,\n"+
		"In zeal to you and highly moved to wrath\n"+
		"To be controll'd in that he frankly gave:\n"+
		"Receive him, then, to favor, Saturnine,\n"+
		"That hath express'd himself in all his deeds\n"+
		"A father and a friend to thee and Rome.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Prince Bassianus, leave to plead my deeds:\n"+
		"'Tis thou and those that have dishonour'd me.\n"+
		"Rome and the righteous heavens be my judge,\n"+
		"How I have loved and honour'd Saturnine!\n"+
		"TAMORA\n"+
		"My worthy lord, if ever Tamora\n"+
		"Were gracious in those princely eyes of thine,\n"+
		"Then hear me speak in indifferently for all;\n"+
		"And at my suit, sweet, pardon what is past.\n"+
		"SATURNINUS\n"+
		"What, madam! be dishonour'd openly,\n"+
		"And basely put it up without revenge?\n"+
		"TAMORA\n"+
		"Not so, my lord; the gods of Rome forfend\n"+
		"I should be author to dishonour you!\n"+
		"But on mine honour dare I undertake\n"+
		"For good Lord Titus' innocence in all;\n"+
		"Whose fury not dissembled speaks his griefs:\n"+
		"Then, at my suit, look graciously on him;\n"+
		"Lose not so noble a friend on vain suppose,\n"+
		"Nor with sour looks afflict his gentle heart.\n"+
		"Aside to SATURNINUS\n"+
		"be won at last;\n"+
		"Dissemble all your griefs and discontents:\n"+
		"You are but newly planted in your throne;\n"+
		"Lest, then, the people, and patricians too,\n"+
		"Upon a just survey, take Titus' part,\n"+
		"And so supplant you for ingratitude,\n"+
		"Which Rome reputes to be a heinous sin,\n"+
		"Yield at entreats; and then let me alone:\n"+
		"I'll find a day to massacre them all\n"+
		"And raze their faction and their family,\n"+
		"The cruel father and his traitorous sons,\n"+
		"To whom I sued for my dear son's life,\n"+
		"And make them know what 'tis to let a queen\n"+
		"Kneel in the streets and beg for grace in vain.\n"+
		"Aloud\n"+
		"Come, come, sweet emperor; come, Andronicus;\n"+
		"Take up this good old man, and cheer the heart\n"+
		"That dies in tempest of thy angry frown.\n"+
		"SATURNINUS\n"+
		"Rise, Titus, rise; my empress hath prevail'd.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"I thank your majesty, and her, my lord:\n"+
		"These words, these looks, infuse new life in me.\n"+
		"TAMORA\n"+
		"Titus, I am incorporate in Rome,\n"+
		"A Roman now adopted happily,\n"+
		"And must advise the emperor for his good.\n"+
		"This day all quarrels die, Andronicus;\n"+
		"And let it be mine honour, good my lord,\n"+
		"That I have reconciled your friends and you.\n"+
		"For you, Prince Bassianus, I have pass'd\n"+
		"My word and promise to the emperor,\n"+
		"That you will be more mild and tractable.\n"+
		"And fear not lords, and you, Lavinia;\n"+
		"By my advice, all humbled on your knees,\n"+
		"You shall ask pardon of his majesty.\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"We do, and vow to heaven and to his highness,\n"+
		"That what we did was mildly as we might,\n"+
		"Tendering our sister's honour and our own.\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"That, on mine honour, here I do protest.\n"+
		"SATURNINUS\n"+
		"Away, and talk not; trouble us no more.\n"+
		"TAMORA\n"+
		"Nay, nay, sweet emperor, we must all be friends:\n"+
		"The tribune and his nephews kneel for grace;\n"+
		"I will not be denied: sweet heart, look back.\n"+
		"SATURNINUS\n"+
		"Marcus, for thy sake and thy brother's here,\n"+
		"And at my lovely Tamora's entreats,\n"+
		"I do remit these young men's heinous faults: Stand up.\n"+
		"Lavinia, though you left me like a churl,\n"+
		"I found a friend, and sure as death I swore\n"+
		"I would not part a bachelor from the priest.\n"+
		"Come, if the emperor's court can feast two brides,\n"+
		"You are my guest, Lavinia, and your friends.\n"+
		"This day shall be a love-day, Tamora.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"To-morrow, an it please your majesty\n"+
		"To hunt the panther and the hart with me,\n"+
		"With horn and hound we'll give your grace bonjour.\n"+
		"SATURNINUS\n"+
		"Be it so, Titus, and gramercy too.\n"+
		"Flourish. Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT II\n"+
		"SCENE I. Rome. Before the Palace.\n"+
		"Enter AARON\n"+
		"AARON\n"+
		"Now climbeth Tamora Olympus' top,\n"+
		"Safe out of fortune's shot; and sits aloft,\n"+
		"Secure of thunder's crack or lightning flash;\n"+
		"Advanced above pale envy's threatening reach.\n"+
		"As when the golden sun salutes the morn,\n"+
		"And, having gilt the ocean with his beams,\n"+
		"Gallops the zodiac in his glistering coach,\n"+
		"And overlooks the highest-peering hills;\n"+
		"So Tamora:\n"+
		"Upon her wit doth earthly honour wait,\n"+
		"And virtue stoops and trembles at her frown.\n"+
		"Then, Aaron, arm thy heart, and fit thy thoughts,\n"+
		"To mount aloft with thy imperial mistress,\n"+
		"And mount her pitch, whom thou in triumph long\n"+
		"Hast prisoner held, fetter'd in amorous chains\n"+
		"And faster bound to Aaron's charming eyes\n"+
		"Than is Prometheus tied to Caucasus.\n"+
		"Away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts!\n"+
		"I will be bright, and shine in pearl and gold,\n"+
		"To wait upon this new-made empress.\n"+
		"To wait, said I? to wanton with this queen,\n"+
		"This goddess, this Semiramis, this nymph,\n"+
		"This siren, that will charm Rome's Saturnine,\n"+
		"And see his shipwreck and his commonweal's.\n"+
		"Holloa! what storm is this?\n"+
		"Enter DEMETRIUS and CHIRON, braving\n"+
		"DEMETRIUS\n"+
		"Chiron, thy years want wit, thy wit wants edge,\n"+
		"And manners, to intrude where I am graced;\n"+
		"And may, for aught thou know'st, affected be.\n"+
		"CHIRON\n"+
		"Demetrius, thou dost over-ween in all;\n"+
		"And so in this, to bear me down with braves.\n"+
		"'Tis not the difference of a year or two\n"+
		"Makes me less gracious or thee more fortunate:\n"+
		"I am as able and as fit as thou\n"+
		"To serve, and to deserve my mistress' grace;\n"+
		"And that my sword upon thee shall approve,\n"+
		"And plead my passions for Lavinia's love.\n"+
		"AARON\n"+
		"[Aside] Clubs, clubs! these lovers will not keep\n"+
		"the peace.\n"+
		"DEMETRIUS\n"+
		"Why, boy, although our mother, unadvised,\n"+
		"Gave you a dancing-rapier by your side,\n"+
		"Are you so desperate grown, to threat your friends?\n"+
		"Go to; have your lath glued within your sheath\n"+
		"Till you know better how to handle it.\n"+
		"CHIRON\n"+
		"Meanwhile, sir, with the little skill I have,\n"+
		"Full well shalt thou perceive how much I dare.\n"+
		"DEMETRIUS\n"+
		"Ay, boy, grow ye so brave?\n"+
		"They draw\n"+
		"AARON\n"+
		"[Coming forward] Why, how now, lords!\n"+
		"So near the emperor's palace dare you draw,\n"+
		"And maintain such a quarrel openly?\n"+
		"Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge:\n"+
		"I would not for a million of gold\n"+
		"The cause were known to them it most concerns;\n"+
		"Nor would your noble mother for much more\n"+
		"Be so dishonour'd in the court of Rome.\n"+
		"For shame, put up.\n"+
		"DEMETRIUS\n"+
		"Not I, till I have sheathed\n"+
		"My rapier in his bosom and withal\n"+
		"Thrust these reproachful speeches down his throat\n"+
		"That he hath breathed in my dishonour here.\n"+
		"CHIRON\n"+
		"For that I am prepared and full resolved.\n"+
		"Foul-spoken coward, that thunder'st with thy tongue,\n"+
		"And with thy weapon nothing darest perform!\n"+
		"AARON\n"+
		"Away, I say!\n"+
		"Now, by the gods that warlike Goths adore,\n"+
		"This petty brabble will undo us all.\n"+
		"Why, lords, and think you not how dangerous\n"+
		"It is to jet upon a prince's right?\n"+
		"What, is Lavinia then become so loose,\n"+
		"Or Bassianus so degenerate,\n"+
		"That for her love such quarrels may be broach'd\n"+
		"Without controlment, justice, or revenge?\n"+
		"Young lords, beware! and should the empress know\n"+
		"This discord's ground, the music would not please.\n"+
		"CHIRON\n"+
		"I care not, I, knew she and all the world:\n"+
		"I love Lavinia more than all the world.\n"+
		"DEMETRIUS\n"+
		"Youngling, learn thou to make some meaner choice:\n"+
		"Lavinia is thine elder brother's hope.\n"+
		"AARON\n"+
		"Why, are ye mad? or know ye not, in Rome\n"+
		"How furious and impatient they be,\n"+
		"And cannot brook competitors in love?\n"+
		"I tell you, lords, you do but plot your deaths\n"+
		"By this device.\n"+
		"CHIRON\n"+
		"Aaron, a thousand deaths\n"+
		"Would I propose to achieve her whom I love.\n"+
		"AARON\n"+
		"To achieve her! how?\n"+
		"DEMETRIUS\n"+
		"Why makest thou it so strange?\n"+
		"She is a woman, therefore may be woo'd;\n"+
		"She is a woman, therefore may be won;\n"+
		"She is Lavinia, therefore must be loved.\n"+
		"What, man! more water glideth by the mill\n"+
		"Than wots the miller of; and easy it is\n"+
		"Of a cut loaf to steal a shive, we know:\n"+
		"Though Bassianus be the emperor's brother.\n"+
		"Better than he have worn Vulcan's badge.\n"+
		"AARON\n"+
		"[Aside] Ay, and as good as Saturninus may.\n"+
		"DEMETRIUS\n"+
		"Then why should he despair that knows to court it\n"+
		"With words, fair looks and liberality?\n"+
		"What, hast not thou full often struck a doe,\n"+
		"And borne her cleanly by the keeper's nose?\n"+
		"AARON\n"+
		"Why, then, it seems, some certain snatch or so\n"+
		"Would serve your turns.\n"+
		"CHIRON\n"+
		"Ay, so the turn were served.\n"+
		"DEMETRIUS\n"+
		"Aaron, thou hast hit it.\n"+
		"AARON\n"+
		"Would you had hit it too!\n"+
		"Then should not we be tired with this ado.\n"+
		"Why, hark ye, hark ye! and are you such fools\n"+
		"To square for this? would it offend you, then\n"+
		"That both should speed?\n"+
		"CHIRON\n"+
		"Faith, not me.\n"+
		"DEMETRIUS\n"+
		"Nor me, so I were one.\n"+
		"AARON\n"+
		"For shame, be friends, and join for that you jar:\n"+
		"'Tis policy and stratagem must do\n"+
		"That you affect; and so must you resolve,\n"+
		"That what you cannot as you would achieve,\n"+
		"You must perforce accomplish as you may.\n"+
		"Take this of me: Lucrece was not more chaste\n"+
		"Than this Lavinia, Bassianus' love.\n"+
		"A speedier course than lingering languishment\n"+
		"Must we pursue, and I have found the path.\n"+
		"My lords, a solemn hunting is in hand;\n"+
		"There will the lovely Roman ladies troop:\n"+
		"The forest walks are wide and spacious;\n"+
		"And many unfrequented plots there are\n"+
		"Fitted by kind for rape and villany:\n"+
		"Single you thither then this dainty doe,\n"+
		"And strike her home by force, if not by words:\n"+
		"This way, or not at all, stand you in hope.\n"+
		"Come, come, our empress, with her sacred wit\n"+
		"To villany and vengeance consecrate,\n"+
		"Will we acquaint with all that we intend;\n"+
		"And she shall file our engines with advice,\n"+
		"That will not suffer you to square yourselves,\n"+
		"But to your wishes' height advance you both.\n"+
		"The emperor's court is like the house of Fame,\n"+
		"The palace full of tongues, of eyes, and ears:\n"+
		"The woods are ruthless, dreadful, deaf, and dull;\n"+
		"There speak, and strike, brave boys, and take\n"+
		"your turns;\n"+
		"There serve your lusts, shadow'd from heaven's eye,\n"+
		"And revel in Lavinia's treasury.\n"+
		"CHIRON\n"+
		"Thy counsel, lad, smells of no cowardice,\n"+
		"DEMETRIUS\n"+
		"Sit fas aut nefas, till I find the stream\n"+
		"To cool this heat, a charm to calm these fits.\n"+
		"Per Styga, per manes vehor.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. A forest near Rome. Horns and cry of hounds heard.\n"+
		"Enter TITUS ANDRONICUS, with Hunters, & c., MARCUS, LUCIUS, QUINTUS, and MARTIUS\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"The hunt is up, the morn is bright and grey,\n"+
		"The fields are fragrant and the woods are green:\n"+
		"Uncouple here and let us make a bay\n"+
		"And wake the emperor and his lovely bride\n"+
		"And rouse the prince and ring a hunter's peal,\n"+
		"That all the court may echo with the noise.\n"+
		"Sons, let it be your charge, as it is ours,\n"+
		"To attend the emperor's person carefully:\n"+
		"I have been troubled in my sleep this night,\n"+
		"But dawning day new comfort hath inspired.\n"+
		"A cry of hounds and horns, winded in a peal. Enter SATURNINUS, TAMORA, BASSIANUS, LAVINIA, DEMETRIUS, CHIRON, and Attendants\n"+
		"Many good morrows to your majesty;\n"+
		"Madam, to you as many and as good:\n"+
		"I promised your grace a hunter's peal.\n"+
		"SATURNINUS\n"+
		"And you have rung it lustily, my lord;\n"+
		"Somewhat too early for new-married ladies.\n"+
		"BASSIANUS\n"+
		"Lavinia, how say you?\n"+
		"LAVINIA\n"+
		"I say, no;\n"+
		"I have been broad awake two hours and more.\n"+
		"SATURNINUS\n"+
		"Come on, then; horse and chariots let us have,\n"+
		"And to our sport.\n"+
		"To TAMORA\n"+
		"Madam, now shall ye see\n"+
		"Our Roman hunting.\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"I have dogs, my lord,\n"+
		"Will rouse the proudest panther in the chase,\n"+
		"And climb the highest promontory top.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"And I have horse will follow where the game\n"+
		"Makes way, and run like swallows o'er the plain.\n"+
		"DEMETRIUS\n"+
		"Chiron, we hunt not, we, with horse nor hound,\n"+
		"But hope to pluck a dainty doe to ground.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. A lonely part of the forest.\n"+
		"Enter AARON, with a bag of gold\n"+
		"AARON\n"+
		"He that had wit would think that I had none,\n"+
		"To bury so much gold under a tree,\n"+
		"And never after to inherit it.\n"+
		"Let him that thinks of me so abjectly\n"+
		"Know that this gold must coin a stratagem,\n"+
		"Which, cunningly effected, will beget\n"+
		"A very excellent piece of villany:\n"+
		"And so repose, sweet gold, for their unrest\n"+
		"Hides the gold\n"+
		"That have their alms out of the empress' chest.\n"+
		"Enter TAMORA\n"+
		"TAMORA\n"+
		"My lovely Aaron, wherefore look'st thou sad,\n"+
		"When every thing doth make a gleeful boast?\n"+
		"The birds chant melody on every bush,\n"+
		"The snake lies rolled in the cheerful sun,\n"+
		"The green leaves quiver with the cooling wind\n"+
		"And make a chequer'd shadow on the ground:\n"+
		"Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit,\n"+
		"And, whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds,\n"+
		"Replying shrilly to the well-tuned horns,\n"+
		"As if a double hunt were heard at once,\n"+
		"Let us sit down and mark their yelping noise;\n"+
		"And, after conflict such as was supposed\n"+
		"The wandering prince and Dido once enjoy'd,\n"+
		"When with a happy storm they were surprised\n"+
		"And curtain'd with a counsel-keeping cave,\n"+
		"We may, each wreathed in the other's arms,\n"+
		"Our pastimes done, possess a golden slumber;\n"+
		"Whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds\n"+
		"Be unto us as is a nurse's song\n"+
		"Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep.\n"+
		"AARON\n"+
		"Madam, though Venus govern your desires,\n"+
		"Saturn is dominator over mine:\n"+
		"What signifies my deadly-standing eye,\n"+
		"My silence and my cloudy melancholy,\n"+
		"My fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls\n"+
		"Even as an adder when she doth unroll\n"+
		"To do some fatal execution?\n"+
		"No, madam, these are no venereal signs:\n"+
		"Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand,\n"+
		"Blood and revenge are hammering in my head.\n"+
		"Hark Tamora, the empress of my soul,\n"+
		"Which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee,\n"+
		"This is the day of doom for Bassianus:\n"+
		"His Philomel must lose her tongue to-day,\n"+
		"Thy sons make pillage of her chastity\n"+
		"And wash their hands in Bassianus' blood.\n"+
		"Seest thou this letter? take it up, I pray thee,\n"+
		"And give the king this fatal plotted scroll.\n"+
		"Now question me no more; we are espied;\n"+
		"Here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty,\n"+
		"Which dreads not yet their lives' destruction.\n"+
		"TAMORA\n"+
		"Ah, my sweet Moor, sweeter to me than life!\n"+
		"AARON\n"+
		"No more, great empress; Bassianus comes:\n"+
		"Be cross with him; and I'll go fetch thy sons\n"+
		"To back thy quarrels, whatsoe'er they be.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"Enter BASSIANUS and LAVINIA\n"+
		"BASSIANUS\n"+
		"Who have we here? Rome's royal empress,\n"+
		"Unfurnish'd of her well-beseeming troop?\n"+
		"Or is it Dian, habited like her,\n"+
		"Who hath abandoned her holy groves\n"+
		"To see the general hunting in this forest?\n"+
		"TAMORA\n"+
		"Saucy controller of our private steps!\n"+
		"Had I the power that some say Dian had,\n"+
		"Thy temples should be planted presently\n"+
		"With horns, as was Actaeon's; and the hounds\n"+
		"Should drive upon thy new-transformed limbs,\n"+
		"Unmannerly intruder as thou art!\n"+
		"LAVINIA\n"+
		"Under your patience, gentle empress,\n"+
		"'Tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning;\n"+
		"And to be doubted that your Moor and you\n"+
		"Are singled forth to try experiments:\n"+
		"Jove shield your husband from his hounds to-day!\n"+
		"'Tis pity they should take him for a stag.\n"+
		"BASSIANUS\n"+
		"Believe me, queen, your swarth Cimmerian\n"+
		"Doth make your honour of his body's hue,\n"+
		"Spotted, detested, and abominable.\n"+
		"Why are you sequester'd from all your train,\n"+
		"Dismounted from your snow-white goodly steed.\n"+
		"And wander'd hither to an obscure plot,\n"+
		"Accompanied but with a barbarous Moor,\n"+
		"If foul desire had not conducted you?\n"+
		"LAVINIA\n"+
		"And, being intercepted in your sport,\n"+
		"Great reason that my noble lord be rated\n"+
		"For sauciness. I pray you, let us hence,\n"+
		"And let her joy her raven-colour'd love;\n"+
		"This valley fits the purpose passing well.\n"+
		"BASSIANUS\n"+
		"The king my brother shall have note of this.\n"+
		"LAVINIA\n"+
		"Ay, for these slips have made him noted long:\n"+
		"Good king, to be so mightily abused!\n"+
		"TAMORA\n"+
		"Why have I patience to endure all this?\n"+
		"Enter DEMETRIUS and CHIRON\n"+
		"DEMETRIUS\n"+
		"How now, dear sovereign, and our gracious mother!\n"+
		"Why doth your highness look so pale and wan?\n"+
		"TAMORA\n"+
		"Have I not reason, think you, to look pale?\n"+
		"These two have 'ticed me hither to this place:\n"+
		"A barren detested vale, you see it is;\n"+
		"The trees, though summer, yet forlorn and lean,\n"+
		"O'ercome with moss and baleful mistletoe:\n"+
		"Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds,\n"+
		"Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven:\n"+
		"And when they show'd me this abhorred pit,\n"+
		"They told me, here, at dead time of the night,\n"+
		"A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,\n"+
		"Ten thousand swelling toads, as many urchins,\n"+
		"Would make such fearful and confused cries\n"+
		"As any mortal body hearing it\n"+
		"Should straight fall mad, or else die suddenly.\n"+
		"No sooner had they told this hellish tale,\n"+
		"But straight they told me they would bind me here\n"+
		"Unto the body of a dismal yew,\n"+
		"And leave me to this miserable death:\n"+
		"And then they call'd me foul adulteress,\n"+
		"Lascivious Goth, and all the bitterest terms\n"+
		"That ever ear did hear to such effect:\n"+
		"And, had you not by wondrous fortune come,\n"+
		"This vengeance on me had they executed.\n"+
		"Revenge it, as you love your mother's life,\n"+
		"Or be ye not henceforth call'd my children.\n"+
		"DEMETRIUS\n"+
		"This is a witness that I am thy son.\n"+
		"Stabs BASSIANUS\n"+
		"CHIRON\n"+
		"And this for me, struck home to show my strength.\n"+
		"Also stabs BASSIANUS, who dies\n"+
		"LAVINIA\n"+
		"Ay, come, Semiramis, nay, barbarous Tamora,\n"+
		"For no name fits thy nature but thy own!\n"+
		"TAMORA\n"+
		"Give me thy poniard; you shall know, my boys\n"+
		"Your mother's hand shall right your mother's wrong.\n"+
		"DEMETRIUS\n"+
		"Stay, madam; here is more belongs to her;\n"+
		"First thrash the corn, then after burn the straw:\n"+
		"This minion stood upon her chastity,\n"+
		"Upon her nuptial vow, her loyalty,\n"+
		"And with that painted hope braves your mightiness:\n"+
		"And shall she carry this unto her grave?\n"+
		"CHIRON\n"+
		"An if she do, I would I were an eunuch.\n"+
		"Drag hence her husband to some secret hole,\n"+
		"And make his dead trunk pillow to our lust.\n"+
		"TAMORA\n"+
		"But when ye have the honey ye desire,\n"+
		"Let not this wasp outlive, us both to sting.\n"+
		"CHIRON\n"+
		"I warrant you, madam, we wil l make that sure.\n"+
		"Come, mistress, now perforce we will enjoy\n"+
		"That nice-preserved honesty of yours.\n"+
		"LAVINIA\n"+
		"O Tamora! thou bear'st a woman's face,--\n"+
		"TAMORA\n"+
		"I will not hear her speak; away with her!\n"+
		"LAVINIA\n"+
		"Sweet lords, entreat her hear me but a word.\n"+
		"DEMETRIUS\n"+
		"Listen, fair madam: let it be your glory\n"+
		"To see her tears; but be your heart to them\n"+
		"As unrelenting flint to drops of rain.\n"+
		"LAVINIA\n"+
		"When did the tiger's young ones teach the dam?\n"+
		"O, do not learn her wrath; she taught it thee;\n"+
		"The milk thou suck'dst from her did turn to marble;\n"+
		"Even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny.\n"+
		"Yet every mother breeds not sons alike:\n"+
		"To CHIRON\n"+
		"Do thou entreat her show a woman pity.\n"+
		"CHIRON\n"+
		"What, wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard?\n"+
		"LAVINIA\n"+
		"'Tis true; the raven doth not hatch a lark:\n"+

		"TAMORA\n"+
		"I know not what it means; away with her!\n"+
		"LAVINIA\n"+
		"O, let me teach thee! for my father's sake,\n"+
		"That gave thee life, when well he might have\n"+

		"Be not obdurate, open thy deaf ears.\n"+
		"TAMORA\n"+

		"Remember, boys, I pour'd forth tears in vain,\n"+
		"To save your brother from the sacrifice;\n"+

		"And shows the ragged entrails of the pit:\n"+
		"So pale did shine the moon on Pyramus\n"+
		"When he by night lay bathed in maiden blood.\n"+

		"If I do dream, would all my wealth would wake me!\n"+
		"If I do wake, some planet strike me down,\n"+
		"That I may slumber in eternal sleep!\n"+
		"Speak, gentle niece, what stern ungentle hands\n"+
		"Have lopp'd and hew'd and made thy body bare\n"+
		"Of her two branches, those sweet ornaments,\n"+
		"Whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in,\n"+
		"And might not gain so great a happiness\n"+
		"As have thy love? Why dost not speak to me?\n"+
		"Alas, a crimson river of warm blood,\n"+
		"Like to a bubbling fountain stirr'd with wind,\n"+
		"Doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips,\n"+
		"Coming and going with thy honey breath.\n"+
		"But, sure, some Tereus hath deflowered thee,\n"+
		"And, lest thou shouldst detect him, cut thy tongue.\n"+
		"Ah, now thou turn'st away thy face for shame!\n"+
		"And, notwithstanding all this loss of blood,\n"+
		"As from a conduit with three issuing spouts,\n"+
		"Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titan's face\n"+
		"Blushing to be encountered with a cloud.\n"+
		"Shall I speak for thee? shall I say 'tis so?\n"+
		"O, that I knew thy heart; and knew the beast,\n"+
		"That I might rail at him, to ease my mind!\n"+
		"Sorrow concealed, like an oven stopp'd,\n"+
		"Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is.\n"+
		"Fair Philomela, she but lost her tongue,\n"+
		"And in a tedious sampler sew'd her mind:\n"+
		"But, lovely niece, that mean is cut from thee;\n"+
		"A craftier Tereus, cousin, hast thou met,\n"+
		"And he hath cut those pretty fingers off,\n"+
		"That could have better sew'd than Philomel.\n"+
		"O, had the monster seen those lily hands\n"+
		"Tremble, like aspen-leaves, upon a lute,\n"+
		"And make the silken strings delight to kiss them,\n"+
		"He would not then have touch'd them for his life!\n"+
		"Or, had he heard the heavenly harmony\n"+
		"Which that sweet tongue hath made,\n"+
		"He would have dropp'd his knife, and fell asleep\n"+
		"As Cerberus at the Thracian poet's feet.\n"+
		"Come, let us go, and make thy father blind;\n"+
		"For such a sight will blind a father's eye:\n"+

		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT III\n"+
		"SCENE I. Rome. A street.\n"+
		"Enter Judges, Senators and Tribunes, with MARTIUS and QUINTUS, bound, passing on to the place of execution; TITUS going before, pleading\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Hear me, grave fathers! noble tribunes, stay!\n"+
		"For pity of mine age, whose youth was spent\n"+
		"In dangerous wars, whilst you securely slept;\n"+
		"For all my blood in Rome's great quarrel shed;\n"+
		"For all the frosty nights that I have watch'd;\n"+
		"And for these bitter tears, which now you see\n"+
		"Filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks;\n"+
		"Be pitiful to my condemned sons,\n"+
		"Whose souls are not corrupted as 'tis thought.\n"+
		"For two and twenty sons I never wept,\n"+
		"Because they died in honour's lofty bed.\n"+
		"Lieth down; the Judges, & c., pass by him, and Exeunt\n"+
		"For these, these, tribunes, in the dust I write\n"+
		"My heart's deep languor and my soul's sad tears:\n"+
		"Let my tears stanch the earth's dry appetite;\n"+
		"My sons' sweet blood will make it shame and blush.\n"+
		"O earth, I will befriend thee more with rain,\n"+
		"That shall distil from these two ancient urns,\n"+
		"Than youthful April shall with all his showers:\n"+
		"In summer's drought I'll drop upon thee still;\n"+
		"In winter with warm tears I'll melt the snow\n"+
		"And keep eternal spring-time on thy face,\n"+
		"So thou refuse to drink my dear sons' blood.\n"+
		"Enter LUCIUS, with his sword drawn\n"+
		"O reverend tribunes! O gentle, aged men!\n"+
		"Unbind my sons, reverse the doom of death;\n"+
		"And let me say, that never wept before,\n"+
		"My tears are now prevailing orators.\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"O noble father, you lament in vain:\n"+
		"The tribunes hear you not; no man is by;\n"+
		"And you recount your sorrows to a stone.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Ah, Lucius, for thy brothers let me plead.\n"+
		"Grave tribunes, once more I entreat of you,--\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"My gracious lord, no tribune hears you speak.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Why, tis no matter, man; if they did hear,\n"+
		"They would not mark me, or if they did mark,\n"+
		"They would not pity me, yet plead I must;\n"+
		"Therefore I tell my sorrows to the stones;\n"+
		"Who, though they cannot answer my distress,\n"+
		"Yet in some sort they are better than the tribunes,\n"+
		"For that they will not intercept my tale:\n"+
		"When I do weep, they humbly at my feet\n"+
		"Receive my tears and seem to weep with me;\n"+
		"And, were they but attired in grave weeds,\n"+
		"Rome could afford no tribune like to these.\n"+
		"A stone is soft as wax,--tribunes more hard than stones;\n"+
		"A stone is silent, and offendeth not,\n"+
		"And tribunes with their tongues doom men to death.\n"+
		"Rises\n"+
		"But wherefore stand'st thou with thy weapon drawn?\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"To rescue my two brothers from their death:\n"+
		"For which attempt the judges have pronounced\n"+
		"My everlasting doom of banishment.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"O happy man! they have befriended thee.\n"+
		"Why, foolish Lucius, dost thou not perceive\n"+
		"That Rome is but a wilderness of tigers?\n"+
		"Tigers must prey, and Rome affords no prey\n"+
		"But me and mine: how happy art thou, then,\n"+
		"From these devourers to be banished!\n"+
		"But who comes with our brother Marcus here?\n"+
		"Enter MARCUS and LAVINIA\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Titus, prepare thy aged eyes to weep;\n"+
		"Or, if not so, thy noble heart to break:\n"+
		"I bring consuming sorrow to thine age.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Will it consume me? let me see it, then.\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"This was thy daughter.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Why, Marcus, so she is.\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"Ay me, this object kills me!\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Faint-hearted boy, arise, and look upon her.\n"+
		"Speak, Lavinia, what accursed hand\n"+
		"Hath made thee handless in thy father's sight?\n"+
		"What fool hath added water to the sea,\n"+
		"Or brought a faggot to bright-burning Troy?\n"+
		"My grief was at the height before thou camest,\n"+
		"And now like Nilus, it disdaineth bounds.\n"+
		"Give me a sword, I'll chop off my hands too;\n"+
		"For they have fought for Rome, and all in vain;\n"+
		"And they have nursed this woe, in feeding life;\n"+
		"In bootless prayer have they been held up,\n"+
		"And they have served me to effectless use:\n"+
		"Now all the service I require of them\n"+
		"Is that the one will help to cut the other.\n"+
		"'Tis well, Lavinia, that thou hast no hands;\n"+
		"For hands, to do Rome service, are but vain.\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"Speak, gentle sister, who hath martyr'd thee?\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"O, that delightful engine of her thoughts\n"+
		"That blabb'd them with such pleasing eloquence,\n"+
		"Is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage,\n"+
		"Where, like a sweet melodious bird, it sung\n"+
		"Sweet varied notes, enchanting every ear!\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"O, say thou for her, who hath done this deed?\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"O, thus I found her, straying in the park,\n"+
		"Seeking to hide herself, as doth the deer\n"+
		"That hath received some unrecuring wound.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"It was my deer; and he that wounded her\n"+
		"Hath hurt me more than had he killed me dead:\n"+
		"For now I stand as one upon a rock\n"+
		"Environed with a wilderness of sea,\n"+
		"Who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave,\n"+
		"Expecting ever when some envious surge\n"+
		"Will in his brinish bowels swallow him.\n"+
		"This way to death my wretched sons are gone;\n"+
		"Here stands my other son, a banished man,\n"+
		"And here my brother, weeping at my woes.\n"+
		"But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn,\n"+
		"Is dear Lavinia, dearer than my soul.\n"+
		"Had I but seen thy picture in this plight,\n"+
		"It would have madded me: what shall I do\n"+
		"Now I behold thy lively body so?\n"+
		"Thou hast no hands, to wipe away thy tears:\n"+
		"Nor tongue, to tell me who hath martyr'd thee:\n"+
		"Thy husband he is dead: and for his death\n"+
		"Thy brothers are condemn'd, and dead by this.\n"+
		"Look, Marcus! ah, son Lucius, look on her!\n"+
		"When I did name her brothers, then fresh tears\n"+
		"Stood on her cheeks, as doth the honey-dew\n"+
		"Upon a gather'd lily almost wither'd.\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Perchance she weeps because they kill'd her husband;\n"+
		"Perchance because she knows them innocent.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"If they did kill thy husband, then be joyful\n"+
		"Because the law hath ta'en revenge on them.\n"+
		"No, no, they would not do so foul a deed;\n"+
		"Witness the sorrow that their sister makes.\n"+
		"Gentle Lavinia, let me kiss thy lips.\n"+
		"Or make some sign how I may do thee ease:\n"+
		"Shall thy good uncle, and thy brother Lucius,\n"+
		"And thou, and I, sit round about some fountain,\n"+
		"Looking all downwards to behold our cheeks\n"+
		"How they are stain'd, as meadows, yet not dry,\n"+
		"With miry slime left on them by a flood?\n"+
		"And in the fountain shall we gaze so long\n"+
		"Till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness,\n"+
		"And made a brine-pit with our bitter tears?\n"+
		"Or shall we cut away our hands, like thine?\n"+
		"Or shall we bite our tongues, and in dumb shows\n"+
		"Pass the remainder of our hateful days?\n"+
		"What shall we do? let us, that have our tongues,\n"+
		"Plot some deuce of further misery,\n"+
		"To make us wonder'd at in time to come.\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"Sweet father, cease your tears; for, at your grief,\n"+
		"See how my wretched sister sobs and weeps.\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Patience, dear niece. Good Titus, dry thine eyes.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Ah, Marcus, Marcus! brother, well I wot\n"+
		"Thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine,\n"+
		"For thou, poor man, hast drown'd it with thine own.\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"Ah, my Lavinia, I will wipe thy cheeks.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Mark, Marcus, mark! I understand her signs:\n"+
		"Had she a tongue to speak, now would she say\n"+
		"That to her brother which I said to thee:\n"+
		"His napkin, with his true tears all bewet,\n"+
		"Can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks.\n"+
		"O, what a sympathy of woe is this,\n"+
		"As far from help as Limbo is from bliss!\n"+
		"Enter AARON\n"+
		"AARON\n"+
		"Titus Andronicus, my lord the emperor\n"+
		"Sends thee this word,--that, if thou love thy sons,\n"+
		"Let Marcus, Lucius, or thyself, old Titus,\n"+
		"Or any one of you, chop off your hand,\n"+
		"And send it to the king: he for the same\n"+
		"Will send thee hither both thy sons alive;\n"+
		"And that shall be the ransom for their fault.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"O gracious emperor! O gentle Aaron!\n"+
		"Did ever raven sing so like a lark,\n"+
		"That gives sweet tidings of the sun's uprise?\n"+
		"With all my heart, I'll send the emperor My hand:\n"+
		"Good Aaron, wilt thou help to chop it off?\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"Stay, father! for that noble hand of thine,\n"+
		"That hath thrown down so many enemies,\n"+
		"Shall not be sent: my hand will serve the turn:\n"+
		"My youth can better spare my blood than you;\n"+
		"And therefore mine shall save my brothers' lives.\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Which of your hands hath not defended Rome,\n"+
		"And rear'd aloft the bloody battle-axe,\n"+
		"Writing destruction on the enemy's castle?\n"+
		"O, none of both but are of high desert:\n"+
		"My hand hath been but idle; let it serve\n"+
		"To ransom my two nephews from their death;\n"+
		"Then have I kept it to a worthy end.\n"+
		"AARON\n"+
		"Nay, come, agree whose hand shall go along,\n"+
		"For fear they die before their pardon come.\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"My hand shall go.\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"By heaven, it shall not go!\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Sirs, strive no more: such wither'd herbs as these\n"+
		"Are meet for plucking up, and therefore mine.\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"Sweet father, if I shall be thought thy son,\n"+
		"Let me redeem my brothers both from death.\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"And, for our father's sake and mother's care,\n"+
		"Now let me show a brother's love to thee.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Agree between you; I will spare my hand.\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"Then I'll go fetch an axe.\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"But I will use the axe.\n"+
		"Exeunt LUCIUS and MARCUS\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Come hither, Aaron; I'll deceive them both:\n"+
		"Lend me thy hand, and I will give thee mine.\n"+
		"AARON\n"+

		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"O brother, speak with possibilities,\n"+
		"And do not break into these deep extremes.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Is not my sorrow deep, having no bottom?\n"+
		"Then be my passions bottomless with them.\n"+

		"And wilt thou have a reason for this coil?\n"+
		"I am the sea; hark, how her sighs do blow!\n"+
		"She is the weeping welkin, I the earth:\n"+

		"Then must my earth with her continual tears\n"+
		"Become a deluge, overflow'd and drown'd;\n"+
		"For why my bowels cannot hide her woes,\n"+

		"Ha, ha, ha!\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Why dost thou laugh? it fits not with this hour.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Why, I have not another tear to shed:\n"+
		"Besides, this sorrow is an enemy,\n"+
		"And would usurp upon my watery eyes\n"+
		"And make them blind with tributary tears:\n"+
		"Then which way shall I find Revenge's cave?\n"+
		"For these two heads do seem to speak to me,\n"+
		"And threat me I shall never come to bliss\n"+
		"Till all these mischiefs be return'd again\n"+
		"Even in their throats that have committed them.\n"+
		"Come, let me see what task I have to do.\n"+
		"You heavy people, circle me about,\n"+
		"That I may turn me to each one of you,\n"+
		"And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs.\n"+
		"The vow is made. Come, brother, take a head;\n"+
		"And in this hand the other I will bear.\n"+

		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"So, so; now sit: and look you eat no more\n"+
		"Than will preserve just so much strength in us\n"+
		"As will revenge these bitter woes of ours.\n"+
		"Marcus, unknit that sorrow-wreathen knot:\n"+
		"Thy niece and I, poor creatures, want our hands,\n"+
		"And cannot passionate our tenfold grief\n"+
		"With folded arms. This poor right hand of mine\n"+
		"Is left to tyrannize upon my breast;\n"+
		"Who, when my heart, all mad with misery,\n"+
		"Beats in this hollow prison of my flesh,\n"+
		"Then thus I thump it down.\n"+
		"To LAVINIA\n"+
		"Thou map of woe, that thus dost talk in signs!\n"+
		"When thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating,\n"+
		"Thou canst not strike it thus to make it still.\n"+
		"Wound it with sighing, girl, kill it with groans;\n"+
		"Or get some little knife between thy teeth,\n"+
		"And just against thy heart make thou a hole;\n"+
		"That all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall\n"+
		"May run into that sink, and soaking in\n"+
		"Drown the lamenting fool in sea-salt tears.\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Fie, brother, fie! teach her not thus to lay\n"+
		"Such violent hands upon her tender life.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"How now! has sorrow made thee dote already?\n"+
		"Why, Marcus, no man should be mad but I.\n"+
		"What violent hands can she lay on her life?\n"+
		"Ah, wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands;\n"+
		"To bid AEneas tell the tale twice o'er,\n"+
		"How Troy was burnt and he made miserable?\n"+
		"O, handle not the theme, to talk of hands,\n"+
		"Lest we remember still that we have none.\n"+
		"Fie, fie, how franticly I square my talk,\n"+
		"As if we should forget we had no hands,\n"+
		"If Marcus did not name the word of hands!\n"+
		"Come, let's fall to; and, gentle girl, eat this:\n"+
		"Here is no drink! Hark, Marcus, what she says;\n"+
		"I can interpret all her martyr'd signs;\n"+
		"She says she drinks no other drink but tears,\n"+
		"Brew'd with her sorrow, mesh'd upon her cheeks:\n"+
		"Speechless complainer, I will learn thy thought;\n"+
		"In thy dumb action will I be as perfect\n"+
		"As begging hermits in their holy prayers:\n"+
		"Thou shalt not sigh, nor hold thy stumps to heaven,\n"+
		"Nor wink, nor nod, nor kneel, nor make a sign,\n"+
		"But I of these will wrest an alphabet\n"+
		"And by still practise learn to know thy meaning.\n"+
		"Young LUCIUS\n"+
		"Good grandsire, leave these bitter deep laments:\n"+
		"Make my aunt merry with some pleasing tale.\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Alas, the tender boy, in passion moved,\n"+
		"Doth weep to see his grandsire's heaviness.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Peace, tender sapling; thou art made of tears,\n"+
		"And tears will quickly melt thy life away.\n"+
		"MARCUS strikes the dish with a knife\n"+
		"What dost thou strike at, Marcus, with thy knife?\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"At that that I have kill'd, my lord; a fly.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Out on thee, murderer! thou kill'st my heart;\n"+
		"Mine eyes are cloy'd with view of tyranny:\n"+
		"A deed of death done on the innocent\n"+
		"Becomes not Titus' brother: get thee gone:\n"+
		"I see thou art not for my company.\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Alas, my lord, I have but kill'd a fly.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"But how, if that fly had a father and mother?\n"+
		"How would he hang his slender gilded wings,\n"+
		"And buzz lamenting doings in the air!\n"+
		"Poor harmless fly,\n"+
		"That, with his pretty buzzing melody,\n"+
		"Came here to make us merry! and thou hast\n"+
		"kill'd him.\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Pardon me, sir; it was a black ill-favor'd fly,\n"+
		"Like to the empress' Moor; therefore I kill'd him.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"O, O, O,\n"+
		"Then pardon me for reprehending thee,\n"+
		"For thou hast done a charitable deed.\n"+
		"Give me thy knife, I will insult on him;\n"+
		"Flattering myself, as if it were the Moor\n"+
		"Come hither purposely to poison me.--\n"+
		"There's for thyself, and that's for Tamora.\n"+
		"Ah, sirrah!\n"+
		"Yet, I think, we are not brought so low,\n"+
		"But that between us we can kill a fly\n"+
		"That comes in likeness of a coal-black Moor.\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Alas, poor man! grief has so wrought on him,\n"+
		"He takes false shadows for true substances.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Come, take away. Lavinia, go with me:\n"+
		"I'll to thy closet; and go read with thee\n"+
		"Sad stories chanced in the times of old.\n"+
		"Come, boy, and go with me: thy sight is young,\n"+
		"And thou shalt read when mine begin to dazzle.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT IV\n"+
		"SCENE I. Rome. Titus's garden.\n"+
		"Enter young LUCIUS, and LAVINIA running after him, and the boy flies from her, with books under his arm. Then enter TITUS and MARCUS\n"+
		"Young LUCIUS\n"+
		"Help, grandsire, help! my aunt Lavinia\n"+
		"Follows me every where, I know not why:\n"+
		"Good uncle Marcus, see how swift she comes.\n"+
		"Alas, sweet aunt, I know not what you mean.\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Stand by me, Lucius; do not fear thine aunt.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"She loves thee, boy, too well to do thee harm.\n"+
		"Young LUCIUS\n"+
		"Ay, when my father was in Rome she did.\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"What means my niece Lavinia by these signs?\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Fear her not, Lucius: somewhat doth she mean:\n"+
		"See, Lucius, see how much she makes of thee:\n"+
		"Somewhither would she have thee go with her.\n"+
		"Ah, boy, Cornelia never with more care\n"+
		"Read to her sons than she hath read to thee\n"+
		"Sweet poetry and Tully's Orator.\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus?\n"+
		"Young LUCIUS\n"+
		"My lord, I know not, I, nor can I guess,\n"+
		"Unless some fit or frenzy do possess her:\n"+
		"For I have heard my grandsire say full oft,\n"+
		"Extremity of griefs would make men mad;\n"+
		"And I have read that Hecuba of Troy\n"+
		"Ran mad through sorrow: that made me to fear;\n"+
		"Although, my lord, I know my noble aunt\n"+
		"Loves me as dear as e'er my mother did,\n"+
		"And would not, but in fury, fright my youth:\n"+
		"Which made me down to throw my books, and fly--\n"+
		"Causeless, perhaps. But pardon me, sweet aunt:\n"+
		"And, madam, if my uncle Marcus go,\n"+
		"I will most willingly attend your ladyship.\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Lucius, I will.\n"+
		"LAVINIA turns over with her stumps the books which LUCIUS has let fall\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"How now, Lavinia! Marcus, what means this?\n"+
		"Some book there is that she desires to see.\n"+
		"Which is it, girl, of these? Open them, boy.\n"+
		"But thou art deeper read, and better skill'd\n"+
		"Come, and take choice of all my library,\n"+
		"And so beguile thy sorrow, till the heavens\n"+
		"Reveal the damn'd contriver of this deed.\n"+
		"Why lifts she up her arms in sequence thus?\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"I think she means that there was more than one\n"+
		"Confederate in the fact: ay, more there was;\n"+
		"Or else to heaven she heaves them for revenge.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Lucius, what book is that she tosseth so?\n"+
		"Young LUCIUS\n"+
		"Grandsire, 'tis Ovid's Metamorphoses;\n"+
		"My mother gave it me.\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"For love of her that's gone,\n"+
		"Perhaps she cull'd it from among the rest.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Soft! see how busily she turns the leaves!\n"+
		"Helping her\n"+
		"What would she find? Lavinia, shall I read?\n"+
		"This is the tragic tale of Philomel,\n"+
		"And treats of Tereus' treason and his rape:\n"+
		"And rape, I fear, was root of thine annoy.\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"See, brother, see; note how she quotes the leaves.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Lavinia, wert thou thus surprised, sweet girl,\n"+
		"Ravish'd and wrong'd, as Philomela was,\n"+
		"Forced in the ruthless, vast, and gloomy woods? See, see!\n"+
		"Ay, such a place there is, where we did hunt--\n"+
		"O, had we never, never hunted there!--\n"+
		"Pattern'd by that the poet here describes,\n"+
		"By nature made for murders and for rapes.\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"O, why should nature build so foul a den,\n"+
		"Unless the gods delight in tragedies?\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Give signs, sweet girl, for here are none\n"+
		"but friends,\n"+
		"What Roman lord it was durst do the deed:\n"+
		"Or slunk not Saturnine, as Tarquin erst,\n"+
		"That left the camp to sin in Lucrece' bed?\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Sit down, sweet niece: brother, sit down by me.\n"+
		"Apollo, Pallas, Jove, or Mercury,\n"+
		"Inspire me, that I may this treason find!\n"+
		"My lord, look here: look here, Lavinia:\n"+
		"This sandy plot is plain; guide, if thou canst\n"+
		"This after me, when I have writ my name\n"+
		"Without the help of any hand at all.\n"+
		"He writes his name with his staff, and guides it with feet and mouth\n"+
		"Cursed be that heart that forced us to this shift!\n"+
		"Write thou good niece; and here display, at last,\n"+
		"What God will have discover'd for revenge;\n"+
		"Heaven guide thy pen to print thy sorrows plain,\n"+
		"That we may know the traitors and the truth!\n"+
		"She takes the staff in her mouth, and guides it with her stumps, and writes\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"O, do ye read, my lord, what she hath writ?\n"+
		"'Stuprum. Chiron. Demetrius.'\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"What, what! the lustful sons of Tamora\n"+
		"Performers of this heinous, bloody deed?\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Magni Dominator poli,\n"+
		"Tam lentus audis scelera? tam lentus vides?\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"O, calm thee, gentle lord; although I know\n"+
		"There is enough written upon this earth\n"+
		"To stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughts\n"+
		"And arm the minds of infants to exclaims.\n"+
		"My lord, kneel down with me; Lavinia, kneel;\n"+
		"And kneel, sweet boy, the Roman Hector's hope;\n"+
		"And swear with me, as, with the woful fere\n"+
		"And father of that chaste dishonour'd dame,\n"+
		"Lord Junius Brutus sware for Lucrece' rape,\n"+
		"That we will prosecute by good advice\n"+
		"Mortal revenge upon these traitorous Goths,\n"+
		"And see their blood, or die with this reproach.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"'Tis sure enough, an you knew how.\n"+
		"But if you hunt these bear-whelps, then beware:\n"+
		"The dam will wake; and, if she wind you once,\n"+
		"She's with the lion deeply still in league,\n"+
		"And lulls him whilst she playeth on her back,\n"+
		"And when he sleeps will she do what she list.\n"+
		"You are a young huntsman, Marcus; let it alone;\n"+
		"And, come, I will go get a leaf of brass,\n"+
		"And with a gad of steel will write these words,\n"+
		"And lay it by: the angry northern wind\n"+
		"Will blow these sands, like Sibyl's leaves, abroad,\n"+
		"And where's your lesson, then? Boy, what say you?\n"+
		"Young LUCIUS\n"+
		"I say, my lord, that if I were a man,\n"+
		"Their mother's bed-chamber should not be safe\n"+
		"For these bad bondmen to the yoke of Rome.\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Ay, that's my boy! thy father hath full oft\n"+
		"For his ungrateful country done the like.\n"+
		"Young LUCIUS\n"+
		"And, uncle, so will I, an if I live.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Come, go with me into mine armoury;\n"+
		"Lucius, I'll fit thee; and withal, my boy,\n"+
		"Shalt carry from me to the empress' sons\n"+
		"Presents that I intend to send them both:\n"+
		"Come, come; thou'lt do thy message, wilt thou not?\n"+
		"Young LUCIUS\n"+
		"Ay, with my dagger in their bosoms, grandsire.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"No, boy, not so; I'll teach thee another course.\n"+
		"Lavinia, come. Marcus, look to my house:\n"+
		"Lucius and I'll go brave it at the court:\n"+
		"Ay, marry, will we, sir; and we'll be waited on.\n"+
		"Exeunt TITUS, LAVINIA, and Young LUCIUS\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"O heavens, can you hear a good man groan,\n"+
		"And not relent, or not compassion him?\n"+
		"Marcus, attend him in his ecstasy,\n"+
		"That hath more scars of sorrow in his heart\n"+
		"Than foemen's marks upon his batter'd shield;\n"+
		"But yet so just that he will not revenge.\n"+
		"Revenge, ye heavens, for old Andronicus!\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE II. The same. A room in the palace.\n"+
		"Enter, from one side, AARON, DEMETRIUS, and CHIRON; from the other side, Young LUCIUS, and an Attendant, with a bundle of weapons, and verses writ upon them\n"+
		"CHIRON\n"+

		"Gramercy, lovely Lucius: what's the news?\n"+
		"Young LUCIUS\n"+
		"[Aside] That you are both decipher'd, that's the news,\n"+

		"CHIRON\n"+
		"O, 'tis a verse in Horace; I know it well:\n"+
		"I read it in the grammar long ago.\n"+
		"AARON\n"+
		"Ay, just; a verse in Horace; right, you have it.\n"+
		"Aside\n"+
		"Now, what a thing it is to be an ass!\n"+
		"Here's no sound jest! the old man hath found their guilt;\n"+
		"And sends them weapons wrapped about with lines,\n"+
		"That wound, beyond their feeling, to the quick.\n"+
		"But were our witty empress well afoot,\n"+
		"She would applaud Andronicus' conceit:\n"+
		"But let her rest in her unrest awhile.\n"+
		"And now, young lords, was't not a happy star\n"+
		"Led us to Rome, strangers, and more than so,\n"+
		"Captives, to be advanced to this height?\n"+
		"It did me good, before the palace gate\n"+
		"To brave the tribune in his brother's hearing.\n"+
		"DEMETRIUS\n"+
		"But me more good, to see so great a lord\n"+
		"Basely insinuate and send us gifts.\n"+
		"AARON\n"+
		"Had he not reason, Lord Demetrius?\n"+
		"Did you not use his daughter very friendly?\n"+
		"DEMETRIUS\n"+
		"I would we had a thousand Roman dames\n"+
		"At such a bay, by turn to serve our lust.\n"+

		"Well, God give her good rest! What hath he sent her?\n"+
		"Nurse\n"+
		"A devil.\n"+
		"AARON\n"+
		"Why, then she is the devil's dam; a joyful issue.\n"+
		"Nurse\n"+
		"A joyless, dismal, black, and sorrowful issue:\n"+
		"Here is the babe, as loathsome as a toad\n"+
		"Amongst the fairest breeders of our clime:\n"+
		"The empress sends it thee, thy stamp, thy seal,\n"+
		"And bids thee christen it with thy dagger's point.\n"+
		"AARON\n"+
		"'Zounds, ye whore! is black so base a hue?\n"+
		"Sweet blowse, you are a beauteous blossom, sure.\n"+
		"DEMETRIUS\n"+
		"Villain, what hast thou done?\n"+
		"AARON\n"+
		"That which thou canst not undo.\n"+
		"CHIRON\n"+
		"Thou hast undone our mother.\n"+
		"AARON\n"+
		"Villain, I have done thy mother.\n"+
		"DEMETRIUS\n"+
		"And therein, hellish dog, thou hast undone.\n"+
		"Woe to her chance, and damn'd her loathed choice!\n"+
		"Accursed the offspring of so foul a fiend!\n"+
		"CHIRON\n"+
		"It shall not live.\n"+
		"AARON\n"+
		"It shall not die.\n"+
		"Nurse\n"+
		"Aaron, it must; the mother wills it so.\n"+
		"AARON\n"+
		"What, must it, nurse? then let no man but I\n"+
		"Do execution on my flesh and blood.\n"+
		"DEMETRIUS\n"+
		"I'll broach the tadpole on my rapier's point:\n"+
		"Nurse, give it me; my sword shall soon dispatch it.\n"+
		"AARON\n"+
		"Sooner this sword shall plough thy bowels up.\n"+
		"Takes the Child from the Nurse, and draws\n"+
		"Stay, murderous villains! will you kill your brother?\n"+
		"Now, by the burning tapers of the sky,\n"+
		"That shone so brightly when this boy was got,\n"+
		"He dies upon my scimitar's sharp point\n"+
		"That touches this my first-born son and heir!\n"+
		"I tell you, younglings, not Enceladus,\n"+
		"With all his threatening band of Typhon's brood,\n"+
		"Nor great Alcides, nor the god of war,\n"+
		"Shall seize this prey out of his father's hands.\n"+
		"What, what, ye sanguine, shallow-hearted boys!\n"+
		"Ye white-limed walls! ye alehouse painted signs!\n"+
		"Coal-black is better than another hue,\n"+
		"In that it scorns to bear another hue;\n"+
		"For all the water in the ocean\n"+
		"Can never turn the swan's black legs to white,\n"+
		"Although she lave them hourly in the flood.\n"+
		"Tell the empress from me, I am of age\n"+
		"To keep mine own, excuse it how she can.\n"+
		"DEMETRIUS\n"+
		"Wilt thou betray thy noble mistress thus?\n"+
		"AARON\n"+
		"My mistress is my mistress; this myself,\n"+
		"The vigour and the picture of my youth:\n"+
		"This before all the world do I prefer;\n"+
		"This maugre all the world will I keep safe,\n"+
		"Or some of you shall smoke for it in Rome.\n"+
		"DEMETRIUS\n"+
		"By this our mother is forever shamed.\n"+
		"CHIRON\n"+
		"Rome will despise her for this foul escape.\n"+
		"Nurse\n"+
		"The emperor, in his rage, will doom her death.\n"+
		"CHIRON\n"+
		"I blush to think upon this ignomy.\n"+
		"AARON\n"+
		"Why, there's the privilege your beauty bears:\n"+
		"Fie, treacherous hue, that will betray with blushing\n"+
		"The close enacts and counsels of the heart!\n"+
		"Here's a young lad framed of another leer:\n"+
		"Look, how the black slave smiles upon the father,\n"+
		"As who should say 'Old lad, I am thine own.'\n"+
		"He is your brother, lords, sensibly fed\n"+
		"Of that self-blood that first gave life to you,\n"+
		"And from that womb where you imprison'd were\n"+
		"He is enfranchised and come to light:\n"+
		"Nay, he is your brother by the surer side,\n"+
		"Although my seal be stamped in his face.\n"+
		"Nurse\n"+
		"Aaron, what shall I say unto the empress?\n"+
		"DEMETRIUS\n"+
		"Advise thee, Aaron, what is to be done,\n"+
		"And we will all subscribe to thy advice:\n"+
		"Save thou the child, so we may all be safe.\n"+
		"AARON\n"+
		"Then sit we down, and let us all consult.\n"+
		"My son and I will have the wind of you:\n"+
		"Keep there: now talk at pleasure of your safety.\n"+
		"They sit\n"+
		"DEMETRIUS\n"+
		"How many women saw this child of his?\n"+
		"AARON\n"+
		"Why, so, brave lords! when we join in league,\n"+
		"I am a lamb: but if you brave the Moor,\n"+
		"The chafed boar, the mountain lioness,\n"+
		"The ocean swells not so as Aaron storms.\n"+
		"But say, again; how many saw the child?\n"+
		"Nurse\n"+
		"Cornelia the midwife and myself;\n"+
		"And no one else but the deliver'd empress.\n"+
		"AARON\n"+
		"The empress, the midwife, and yourself:\n"+
		"Two may keep counsel when the third's away:\n"+
		"Go to the empress, tell her this I said.\n"+
		"He kills the nurse\n"+
		"Weke, weke! so cries a pig prepared to the spit.\n"+
		"DEMETRIUS\n"+
		"What mean'st thou, Aaron? wherefore didst thou this?\n"+
		"AARON\n"+
		"O Lord, sir, 'tis a deed of policy:\n"+
		"Shall she live to betray this guilt of ours,\n"+
		"A long-tongued babbling gossip? no, lords, no:\n"+
		"And now be it known to you my full intent.\n"+
		"Not far, one Muli lives, my countryman;\n"+
		"His wife but yesternight was brought to bed;\n"+
		"His child is like to her, fair as you are:\n"+
		"Go pack with him, and give the mother gold,\n"+
		"And tell them both the circumstance of all;\n"+
		"And how by this their child shall be advanced,\n"+
		"And be received for the emperor's heir,\n"+
		"And substituted in the place of mine,\n"+
		"To calm this tempest whirling in the court;\n"+
		"And let the emperor dandle him for his own.\n"+
		"Hark ye, lords; ye see I have given her physic,\n"+
		"Pointing to the nurse\n"+
		"And you must needs bestow her funeral;\n"+
		"The fields are near, and you are gallant grooms:\n"+
		"This done, see that you take no longer days,\n"+
		"But send the midwife presently to me.\n"+
		"The midwife and the nurse well made away,\n"+
		"Then let the ladies tattle what they please.\n"+
		"CHIRON\n"+
		"Aaron, I see thou wilt not trust the air\n"+
		"With secrets.\n"+
		"DEMETRIUS\n"+
		"For this care of Tamora,\n"+
		"Herself and hers are highly bound to thee.\n"+
		"Exeunt DEMETRIUS and CHIRON bearing off the Nurse's body\n"+
		"AARON\n"+
		"Now to the Goths, as swift as swallow flies;\n"+
		"There to dispose this treasure in mine arms,\n"+
		"And secretly to greet the empress' friends.\n"+
		"Come on, you thick lipp'd slave, I'll bear you hence;\n"+
		"For it is you that puts us to our shifts:\n"+
		"I'll make you feed on berries and on roots,\n"+
		"And feed on curds and whey, and suck the goat,\n"+
		"And cabin in a cave, and bring you up\n"+
		"To be a warrior, and command a camp.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE III. The same. A public place.\n"+
		"Enter TITUS, bearing arrows with letters at the ends of them; with him, MARCUS, Young LUCIUS, PUBLIUS, SEMPRONIUS, CAIUS, and other Gentlemen, with bows\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Come, Marcus; come, kinsmen; this is the way.\n"+
		"Sir boy, now let me see your archery;\n"+
		"Look ye draw home enough, and 'tis there straight.\n"+
		"Terras Astraea reliquit:\n"+
		"Be you remember'd, Marcus, she's gone, she's fled.\n"+
		"Sirs, take you to your tools. You, cousins, shall\n"+
		"Go sound the ocean, and cast your nets;\n"+
		"Happily you may catch her in the sea;\n"+
		"Yet there's as little justice as at land:\n"+
		"No; Publius and Sempronius, you must do it;\n"+
		"'Tis you must dig with mattock and with spade,\n"+
		"And pierce the inmost centre of the earth:\n"+
		"Then, when you come to Pluto's region,\n"+
		"I pray you, deliver him this petition;\n"+
		"Tell him, it is for justice and for aid,\n"+
		"And that it comes from old Andronicus,\n"+
		"Shaken with sorrows in ungrateful Rome.\n"+
		"Ah, Rome! Well, well; I made thee miserable\n"+
		"What time I threw the people's suffrages\n"+
		"On him that thus doth tyrannize o'er me.\n"+
		"Go, get you gone; and pray be careful all,\n"+
		"And leave you not a man-of-war unsearch'd:\n"+
		"This wicked emperor may have shipp'd her hence;\n"+
		"And, kinsmen, then we may go pipe for justice.\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"O Publius, is not this a heavy case,\n"+
		"To see thy noble uncle thus distract?\n"+
		"PUBLIUS\n"+
		"Therefore, my lord, it highly us concerns\n"+
		"By day and night to attend him carefully,\n"+
		"And feed his humour kindly as we may,\n"+
		"Till time beget some careful remedy.\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Kinsmen, his sorrows are past remedy.\n"+
		"Join with the Goths; and with revengeful war\n"+
		"Take wreak on Rome for this ingratitude,\n"+
		"And vengeance on the traitor Saturnine.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Publius, how now! how now, my masters!\n"+
		"What, have you met with her?\n"+
		"PUBLIUS\n"+
		"No, my good lord; but Pluto sends you word,\n"+
		"If you will have Revenge from hell, you shall:\n"+
		"Marry, for Justice, she is so employ'd,\n"+
		"He thinks, with Jove in heaven, or somewhere else,\n"+
		"So that perforce you must needs stay a time.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"He doth me wrong to feed me with delays.\n"+
		"I'll dive into the burning lake below,\n"+
		"And pull her out of Acheron by the heels.\n"+
		"Marcus, we are but shrubs, no cedars we\n"+
		"No big-boned men framed of the Cyclops' size;\n"+
		"But metal, Marcus, steel to the very back,\n"+
		"Yet wrung with wrongs more than our backs can bear:\n"+
		"And, sith there's no justice in earth nor hell,\n"+
		"We will solicit heaven and move the gods\n"+
		"To send down Justice for to wreak our wrongs.\n"+
		"Come, to this gear. You are a good archer, Marcus;\n"+
		"He gives them the arrows\n"+
		"'Ad Jovem,' that's for you: here, 'Ad Apollinem:'\n"+
		"'Ad Martem,' that's for myself:\n"+
		"Here, boy, to Pallas: here, to Mercury:\n"+
		"To Saturn, Caius, not to Saturnine;\n"+
		"You were as good to shoot against the wind.\n"+
		"To it, boy! Marcus, loose when I bid.\n"+
		"Of my word, I have written to effect;\n"+
		"There's not a god left unsolicited.\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Kinsmen, shoot all your shafts into the court:\n"+
		"We will afflict the emperor in his pride.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Now, masters, draw.\n"+
		"They shoot\n"+
		"O, well said, Lucius!\n"+
		"Good boy, in Virgo's lap; give it Pallas.\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"My lord, I aim a mile beyond the moon;\n"+
		"Your letter is with Jupiter by this.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Ha, ha!\n"+
		"Publius, Publius, what hast thou done?\n"+
		"See, see, thou hast shot off one of Taurus' horns.\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"This was the sport, my lord: when Publius shot,\n"+
		"The Bull, being gall'd, gave Aries such a knock\n"+
		"That down fell both the Ram's horns in the court;\n"+
		"And who should find them but the empress' villain?\n"+
		"She laugh'd, and told the Moor he should not choose\n"+
		"But give them to his master for a present.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Why, there it goes: God give his lordship joy!\n"+
		"Enter a Clown, with a basket, and two pigeons in it\n"+
		"News, news from heaven! Marcus, the post is come.\n"+
		"Sirrah, what tidings? have you any letters?\n"+
		"Shall I have justice? what says Jupiter?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"O, the gibbet-maker! he says that he hath taken\n"+
		"them down again, for the man must not be hanged till\n"+
		"the next week.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"But what says Jupiter, I ask thee?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Alas, sir, I know not Jupiter; I never drank with him\n"+
		"in all my life.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Why, villain, art not thou the carrier?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Ay, of my pigeons, sir; nothing else.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Why, didst thou not come from heaven?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"From heaven! alas, sir, I never came there God\n"+
		"forbid I should be so bold to press to heaven in my\n"+
		"young days. Why, I am going with my pigeons to the\n"+
		"tribunal plebs, to take up a matter of brawl\n"+
		"betwixt my uncle and one of the emperial's men.\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Why, sir, that is as fit as can be to serve for\n"+
		"your oration; and let him deliver the pigeons to\n"+
		"the emperor from you.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Tell me, can you deliver an oration to the emperor\n"+
		"with a grace?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Nay, truly, sir, I could never say grace in all my life.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Sirrah, come hither: make no more ado,\n"+
		"But give your pigeons to the emperor:\n"+
		"By me thou shalt have justice at his hands.\n"+
		"Hold, hold; meanwhile here's money for thy charges.\n"+
		"Give me pen and ink. Sirrah, can you with a grace\n"+
		"deliver a supplication?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Ay, sir.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Then here is a supplication for you. And when you\n"+
		"come to him, at the first approach you must kneel,\n"+
		"then kiss his foot, then deliver up your pigeons, and\n"+
		"then look for your reward. I'll be at hand, sir; see\n"+
		"you do it bravely.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"I warrant you, sir, let me alone.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Sirrah, hast thou a knife? come, let me see it.\n"+
		"Here, Marcus, fold it in the oration;\n"+
		"For thou hast made it like an humble suppliant.\n"+
		"And when thou hast given it the emperor,\n"+
		"Knock at my door, and tell me what he says.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"God be with you, sir; I will.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Come, Marcus, let us go. Publius, follow me.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV. The same. Before the palace.\n"+
		"Enter SATURNINUS, TAMORA, DEMETRIUS, CHIRON, Lords, and others; SATURNINUS with the arrows in his hand that TITUS shot\n"+
		"SATURNINUS\n"+
		"Why, lords, what wrongs are these! was ever seen\n"+
		"An emperor in Rome thus overborne,\n"+
		"Troubled, confronted thus; and, for the extent\n"+
		"Of egal justice, used in such contempt?\n"+
		"My lords, you know, as know the mightful gods,\n"+
		"However these disturbers of our peace\n"+
		"Buz in the people's ears, there nought hath pass'd,\n"+
		"But even with law, against the willful sons\n"+
		"Of old Andronicus. And what an if\n"+
		"His sorrows have so overwhelm'd his wits,\n"+
		"Shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks,\n"+
		"His fits, his frenzy, and his bitterness?\n"+
		"And now he writes to heaven for his redress:\n"+
		"See, here's to Jove, and this to Mercury;\n"+
		"This to Apollo; this to the god of war;\n"+
		"Sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome!\n"+
		"What's this but libelling against the senate,\n"+
		"And blazoning our injustice every where?\n"+
		"A goodly humour, is it not, my lords?\n"+
		"As who would say, in Rome no justice were.\n"+
		"But if I live, his feigned ecstasies\n"+
		"Shall be no shelter to these outrages:\n"+
		"But he and his shall know that justice lives\n"+
		"In Saturninus' health, whom, if she sleep,\n"+
		"He'll so awake as she in fury shall\n"+
		"Cut off the proud'st conspirator that lives.\n"+
		"TAMORA\n"+
		"My gracious lord, my lovely Saturnine,\n"+
		"Lord of my life, commander of my thoughts,\n"+
		"Calm thee, and bear the faults of Titus' age,\n"+
		"The effects of sorrow for his valiant sons,\n"+
		"Whose loss hath pierced him deep and scarr'd his heart;\n"+
		"And rather comfort his distressed plight\n"+
		"Than prosecute the meanest or the best\n"+
		"For these contempts.\n"+
		"Aside\n"+
		"Why, thus it shall become\n"+
		"High-witted Tamora to gloze with all:\n"+
		"But, Titus, I have touched thee to the quick,\n"+
		"Thy life-blood out: if Aaron now be wise,\n"+
		"Then is all safe, the anchor's in the port.\n"+
		"Enter Clown\n"+
		"How now, good fellow! wouldst thou speak with us?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Yea, forsooth, an your mistership be emperial.\n"+
		"TAMORA\n"+
		"Empress I am, but yonder sits the emperor.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"'Tis he. God and Saint Stephen give you good den:\n"+
		"I have brought you a letter and a couple of pigeons here.\n"+
		"SATURNINUS reads the letter\n"+
		"SATURNINUS\n"+
		"Go, take him away, and hang him presently.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"How much money must I have?\n"+
		"TAMORA\n"+
		"Come, sirrah, you must be hanged.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Hanged! by'r lady, then I have brought up a neck to\n"+
		"a fair end.\n"+
		"Exit, guarded\n"+
		"SATURNINUS\n"+
		"Despiteful and intolerable wrongs!\n"+
		"Shall I endure this monstrous villany?\n"+
		"I know from whence this same device proceeds:\n"+
		"May this be borne?--as if his traitorous sons,\n"+
		"That died by law for murder of our brother,\n"+
		"Have by my means been butcher'd wrongfully!\n"+
		"Go, drag the villain hither by the hair;\n"+
		"Nor age nor honour shall shape privilege:\n"+
		"For this proud mock I'll be thy slaughterman;\n"+
		"Sly frantic wretch, that holp'st to make me great,\n"+
		"In hope thyself should govern Rome and me.\n"+
		"Enter AEMILIUS\n"+
		"What news with thee, AEmilius?\n"+
		"AEMILIUS\n"+
		"Arm, arm, my lord;--Rome never had more cause.\n"+
		"The Goths have gather'd head; and with a power\n"+
		"high-resolved men, bent to the spoil,\n"+
		"They hither march amain, under conduct\n"+
		"Of Lucius, son to old Andronicus;\n"+
		"Who threats, in course of this revenge, to do\n"+
		"As much as ever Coriolanus did.\n"+
		"SATURNINUS\n"+
		"Is warlike Lucius general of the Goths?\n"+
		"These tidings nip me, and I hang the head\n"+
		"As flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms:\n"+
		"Ay, now begin our sorrows to approach:\n"+
		"'Tis he the common people love so much;\n"+
		"Myself hath often over-heard them say,\n"+
		"When I have walked like a private man,\n"+
		"That Lucius' banishment was wrongfully,\n"+
		"And they have wish'd that Lucius were their emperor.\n"+
		"TAMORA\n"+
		"Why should you fear? is not your city strong?\n"+
		"SATURNINUS\n"+
		"Ay, but the citizens favor Lucius,\n"+
		"And will revolt from me to succor him.\n"+
		"TAMORA\n"+
		"King, be thy thoughts imperious, like thy name.\n"+
		"Is the sun dimm'd, that gnats do fly in it?\n"+
		"The eagle suffers little birds to sing,\n"+
		"And is not careful what they mean thereby,\n"+
		"Knowing that with the shadow of his wings\n"+
		"He can at pleasure stint their melody:\n"+
		"Even so mayst thou the giddy men of Rome.\n"+
		"Then cheer thy spirit : for know, thou emperor,\n"+
		"I will enchant the old Andronicus\n"+
		"With words more sweet, and yet more dangerous,\n"+
		"Than baits to fish, or honey-stalks to sheep,\n"+
		"When as the one is wounded with the bait,\n"+
		"The other rotted with delicious feed.\n"+
		"SATURNINUS\n"+
		"But he will not entreat his son for us.\n"+
		"TAMORA\n"+
		"If Tamora entreat him, then he will:\n"+
		"For I can smooth and fill his aged ear\n"+
		"With golden promises; that, were his heart\n"+
		"Almost impregnable, his old ears deaf,\n"+
		"Yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue.\n"+
		"To AEmilius\n"+
		"Go thou before, be our ambassador:\n"+
		"Say that the emperor requests a parley\n"+
		"Of warlike Lucius, and appoint the meeting\n"+
		"Even at his father's house, the old Andronicus.\n"+
		"SATURNINUS\n"+
		"AEmilius, do this message honourably:\n"+
		"And if he stand on hostage for his safety,\n"+
		"Bid him demand what pledge will please him best.\n"+
		"AEMILIUS\n"+
		"Your bidding shall I do effectually.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"TAMORA\n"+
		"Now will I to that old Andronicus;\n"+
		"And temper him with all the art I have,\n"+
		"To pluck proud Lucius from the warlike Goths.\n"+
		"And now, sweet emperor, be blithe again,\n"+
		"And bury all thy fear in my devices.\n"+
		"SATURNINUS\n"+
		"Then go successantly, and plead to him.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT V\n"+
		"SCENE I. Plains near Rome.\n"+
		"Enter LUCIUS with an army of Goths, with drum and colours\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"Approved warriors, and my faithful friends,\n"+
		"I have received letters from great Rome,\n"+
		"Which signify what hate they bear their emperor\n"+
		"And how desirous of our sight they are.\n"+
		"Therefore, great lords, be, as your titles witness,\n"+
		"Imperious and impatient of your wrongs,\n"+
		"And wherein Rome hath done you any scath,\n"+
		"Let him make treble satisfaction.\n"+
		"First Goth\n"+
		"Brave slip, sprung from the great Andronicus,\n"+
		"Whose name was once our terror, now our comfort;\n"+
		"Whose high exploits and honourable deeds\n"+
		"Ingrateful Rome requites with foul contempt,\n"+
		"Be bold in us: we'll follow where thou lead'st,\n"+
		"Like stinging bees in hottest summer's day\n"+
		"Led by their master to the flowered fields,\n"+
		"And be avenged on cursed Tamora.\n"+
		"All the Goths\n"+
		"And as he saith, so say we all with him.\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"I humbly thank him, and I thank you all.\n"+
		"But who comes here, led by a lusty Goth?\n"+
		"Enter a Goth, leading AARON with his Child in his arms\n"+
		"Second Goth\n"+
		"Renowned Lucius, from our troops I stray'd\n"+
		"To gaze upon a ruinous monastery;\n"+
		"And, as I earnestly did fix mine eye\n"+
		"Upon the wasted building, suddenly\n"+
		"I heard a child cry underneath a wall.\n"+
		"I made unto the noise; when soon I heard\n"+
		"The crying babe controll'd with this discourse:\n"+
		"'Peace, tawny slave, half me and half thy dam!\n"+
		"Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art,\n"+
		"Had nature lent thee but thy mother's look,\n"+
		"Villain, thou mightst have been an emperor:\n"+
		"But where the bull and cow are both milk-white,\n"+
		"They never do beget a coal-black calf.\n"+
		"Peace, villain, peace!'--even thus he rates\n"+
		"the babe,--\n"+
		"'For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth;\n"+
		"Who, when he knows thou art the empress' babe,\n"+
		"Will hold thee dearly for thy mother's sake.'\n"+
		"With this, my weapon drawn, I rush'd upon him,\n"+
		"Surprised him suddenly, and brought him hither,\n"+
		"To use as you think needful of the man.\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"O worthy Goth, this is the incarnate devil\n"+
		"That robb'd Andronicus of his good hand;\n"+
		"This is the pearl that pleased your empress' eye,\n"+
		"And here's the base fruit of his burning lust.\n"+
		"Say, wall-eyed slave, whither wouldst thou convey\n"+
		"This growing image of thy fiend-like face?\n"+
		"Why dost not speak? what, deaf? not a word?\n"+
		"A halter, soldiers! hang him on this tree.\n"+
		"And by his side his fruit of bastardy.\n"+
		"AARON\n"+
		"Touch not the boy; he is of royal blood.\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"Too like the sire for ever being good.\n"+
		"First hang the child, that he may see it sprawl;\n"+
		"A sight to vex the father's soul withal.\n"+
		"Get me a ladder.\n"+
		"A ladder brought, which AARON is made to ascend\n"+
		"AARON\n"+
		"Lucius, save the child,\n"+
		"And bear it from me to the empress.\n"+
		"If thou do this, I'll show thee wondrous things,\n"+
		"That highly may advantage thee to hear:\n"+
		"If thou wilt not, befall what may befall,\n"+
		"I'll speak no more but 'Vengeance rot you all!'\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"Say on: an if it please me which thou speak'st\n"+
		"Thy child shall live, and I will see it nourish'd.\n"+
		"AARON\n"+
		"An if it please thee! why, assure thee, Lucius,\n"+
		"'Twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak;\n"+
		"For I must talk of murders, rapes and massacres,\n"+
		"Acts of black night, abominable deeds,\n"+
		"Complots of mischief, treason, villanies\n"+
		"Ruthful to hear, yet piteously perform'd:\n"+
		"And this shall all be buried by my death,\n"+
		"Unless thou swear to me my child shall live.\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"Tell on thy mind; I say thy child shall live.\n"+
		"AARON\n"+
		"Swear that he shall, and then I will begin.\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"Who should I swear by? thou believest no god:\n"+
		"That granted, how canst thou believe an oath?\n"+
		"AARON\n"+
		"What if I do not? as, indeed, I do not;\n"+
		"Yet, for I know thou art religious\n"+
		"And hast a thing within thee called conscience,\n"+
		"With twenty popish tricks and ceremonies,\n"+
		"Which I have seen thee careful to observe,\n"+
		"Therefore I urge thy oath; for that I know\n"+
		"An idiot holds his bauble for a god\n"+
		"And keeps the oath which by that god he swears,\n"+
		"To that I'll urge him: therefore thou shalt vow\n"+
		"By that same god, what god soe'er it be,\n"+
		"That thou adorest and hast in reverence,\n"+
		"To save my boy, to nourish and bring him up;\n"+
		"Or else I will discover nought to thee.\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"Even by my god I swear to thee I will.\n"+
		"AARON\n"+
		"First know thou, I begot him on the empress.\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"O most insatiate and luxurious woman!\n"+
		"AARON\n"+
		"Tut, Lucius, this was but a deed of charity\n"+
		"To that which thou shalt hear of me anon.\n"+
		"'Twas her two sons that murder'd Bassianus;\n"+
		"They cut thy sister's tongue and ravish'd her\n"+
		"And cut her hands and trimm'd her as thou saw'st.\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"O detestable villain! call'st thou that trimming?\n"+
		"AARON\n"+
		"Why, she was wash'd and cut and trimm'd, and 'twas\n"+
		"Trim sport for them that had the doing of it.\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"O barbarous, beastly villains, like thyself!\n"+
		"AARON\n"+
		"Indeed, I was their tutor to instruct them:\n"+
		"That codding spirit had they from their mother,\n"+
		"As sure a card as ever won the set;\n"+
		"That bloody mind, I think, they learn'd of me,\n"+
		"As true a dog as ever fought at head.\n"+
		"Well, let my deeds be witness of my worth.\n"+
		"I train'd thy brethren to that guileful hole\n"+
		"Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay:\n"+
		"I wrote the letter that thy father found\n"+
		"And hid the gold within the letter mention'd,\n"+
		"Confederate with the queen and her two sons:\n"+
		"And what not done, that thou hast cause to rue,\n"+
		"Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it?\n"+
		"I play'd the cheater for thy father's hand,\n"+
		"And, when I had it, drew myself apart\n"+
		"And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter:\n"+
		"I pry'd me through the crevice of a wall\n"+
		"When, for his hand, he had his two sons' heads;\n"+
		"Beheld his tears, and laugh'd so heartily,\n"+
		"That both mine eyes were rainy like to his :\n"+
		"And when I told the empress of this sport,\n"+
		"She swooned almost at my pleasing tale,\n"+
		"And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses.\n"+
		"First Goth\n"+
		"What, canst thou say all this, and never blush?\n"+
		"AARON\n"+
		"Ay, like a black dog, as the saying is.\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?\n"+
		"AARON\n"+
		"Ay, that I had not done a thousand more.\n"+
		"Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,\n"+
		"Few come within the compass of my curse,--\n"+
		"Wherein I did not some notorious ill,\n"+
		"As kill a man, or else devise his death,\n"+
		"Ravish a maid, or plot the way to do it,\n"+
		"Accuse some innocent and forswear myself,\n"+
		"Set deadly enmity between two friends,\n"+
		"Make poor men's cattle break their necks;\n"+
		"Set fire on barns and hay-stacks in the night,\n"+
		"And bid the owners quench them with their tears.\n"+
		"Oft have I digg'd up dead men from their graves,\n"+
		"And set them upright at their dear friends' doors,\n"+
		"Even when their sorrows almost were forgot;\n"+
		"And on their skins, as on the bark of trees,\n"+
		"Have with my knife carved in Roman letters,\n"+
		"'Let not your sorrow die, though I am dead.'\n"+
		"Tut, I have done a thousand dreadful things\n"+
		"As willingly as one would kill a fly,\n"+
		"And nothing grieves me heartily indeed\n"+
		"But that I cannot do ten thousand more.\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"Bring down the devil; for he must not die\n"+
		"So sweet a death as hanging presently.\n"+
		"AARON\n"+
		"If there be devils, would I were a devil,\n"+
		"To live and burn in everlasting fire,\n"+
		"So I might have your company in hell,\n"+
		"But to torment you with my bitter tongue!\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"Sirs, stop his mouth, and let him speak no more.\n"+
		"Enter a Goth\n"+
		"Third Goth\n"+
		"My lord, there is a messenger from Rome\n"+
		"Desires to be admitted to your presence.\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"Let him come near.\n"+
		"Enter AEMILIUS\n"+
		"Welcome, AEmilius what's the news from Rome?\n"+
		"AEMILIUS\n"+
		"Lord Lucius, and you princes of the Goths,\n"+
		"The Roman emperor greets you all by me;\n"+
		"And, for he understands you are in arms,\n"+
		"He craves a parley at your father's house,\n"+
		"Willing you to demand your hostages,\n"+
		"And they shall be immediately deliver'd.\n"+
		"First Goth\n"+
		"What says our general?\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"AEmilius, let the emperor give his pledges\n"+
		"Unto my father and my uncle Marcus,\n"+
		"And we will come. March away.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. Rome. Before TITUS's house.\n"+
		"Enter TAMORA, DEMETRIUS, and CHIRON, disguised\n"+
		"TAMORA\n"+
		"Thus, in this strange and sad habiliment,\n"+
		"I will encounter with Andronicus,\n"+
		"And say I am Revenge, sent from below\n"+
		"To join with him and right his heinous wrongs.\n"+
		"Knock at his study, where, they say, he keeps,\n"+
		"To ruminate strange plots of dire revenge;\n"+
		"Tell him Revenge is come to join with him,\n"+
		"And work confusion on his enemies.\n"+
		"They knock\n"+
		"Enter TITUS, above\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Who doth molest my contemplation?\n"+
		"Is it your trick to make me ope the door,\n"+
		"That so my sad decrees may fly away,\n"+
		"And all my study be to no effect?\n"+
		"You are deceived: for what I mean to do\n"+
		"See here in bloody lines I have set down;\n"+
		"And what is written shall be executed.\n"+
		"TAMORA\n"+
		"Titus, I am come to talk with thee.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"No, not a word; how can I grace my talk,\n"+
		"Wanting a hand to give it action?\n"+
		"Thou hast the odds of me; therefore no more.\n"+
		"TAMORA\n"+
		"If thou didst know me, thou wouldest talk with me.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"I am not mad; I know thee well enough:\n"+
		"Witness this wretched stump, witness these crimson lines;\n"+
		"Witness these trenches made by grief and care,\n"+
		"Witness the tiring day and heavy night;\n"+
		"Witness all sorrow, that I know thee well\n"+
		"For our proud empress, mighty Tamora:\n"+
		"Is not thy coming for my other hand?\n"+
		"TAMORA\n"+
		"Know, thou sad man, I am not Tamora;\n"+
		"She is thy enemy, and I thy friend:\n"+
		"I am Revenge: sent from the infernal kingdom,\n"+
		"To ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind,\n"+
		"By working wreakful vengeance on thy foes.\n"+
		"Come down, and welcome me to this world's light;\n"+
		"Confer with me of murder and of death:\n"+
		"There's not a hollow cave or lurking-place,\n"+
		"No vast obscurity or misty vale,\n"+
		"Where bloody murder or detested rape\n"+
		"Can couch for fear, but I will find them out;\n"+
		"And in their ears tell them my dreadful name,\n"+
		"Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Art thou Revenge? and art thou sent to me,\n"+
		"To be a torment to mine enemies?\n"+
		"TAMORA\n"+
		"I am; therefore come down, and welcome me.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Do me some service, ere I come to thee.\n"+
		"Lo, by thy side where Rape and Murder stands;\n"+
		"Now give me some surance that thou art Revenge,\n"+
		"Stab them, or tear them on thy chariot-wheels;\n"+
		"And then I'll come and be thy waggoner,\n"+
		"And whirl along with thee about the globe.\n"+
		"Provide thee two proper palfreys, black as jet,\n"+
		"To hale thy vengeful waggon swift away,\n"+
		"And find out murderers in their guilty caves:\n"+
		"And when thy car is loaden with their heads,\n"+
		"I will dismount, and by the waggon-wheel\n"+
		"Trot, like a servile footman, all day long,\n"+
		"Even from Hyperion's rising in the east\n"+
		"Until his very downfall in the sea:\n"+
		"And day by day I'll do this heavy task,\n"+
		"So thou destroy Rapine and Murder there.\n"+
		"TAMORA\n"+
		"These are my ministers, and come with me.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Are these thy ministers? what are they call'd?\n"+
		"TAMORA\n"+
		"Rapine and Murder; therefore called so,\n"+
		"Cause they take vengeance of such kind of men.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Good Lord, how like the empress' sons they are!\n"+
		"And you, the empress! but we worldly men\n"+
		"Have miserable, mad, mistaking eyes.\n"+
		"O sweet Revenge, now do I come to thee;\n"+
		"And, if one arm's embracement will content thee,\n"+
		"I will embrace thee in it by and by.\n"+
		"Exit above\n"+
		"TAMORA\n"+
		"This closing with him fits his lunacy\n"+
		"Whate'er I forge to feed his brain-sick fits,\n"+
		"Do you uphold and maintain in your speeches,\n"+
		"For now he firmly takes me for Revenge;\n"+
		"And, being credulous in this mad thought,\n"+
		"I'll make him send for Lucius his son;\n"+
		"And, whilst I at a banquet hold him sure,\n"+
		"I'll find some cunning practise out of hand,\n"+
		"To scatter and disperse the giddy Goths,\n"+
		"Or, at the least, make them his enemies.\n"+
		"See, here he comes, and I must ply my theme.\n"+
		"Enter TITUS below\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Long have I been forlorn, and all for thee:\n"+
		"Welcome, dread Fury, to my woful house:\n"+
		"Rapine and Murder, you are welcome too.\n"+
		"How like the empress and her sons you are!\n"+
		"Well are you fitted, had you but a Moor:\n"+
		"Could not all hell afford you such a devil?\n"+
		"For well I wot the empress never wags\n"+
		"But in her company there is a Moor;\n"+
		"And, would you represent our queen aright,\n"+
		"It were convenient you had such a devil:\n"+
		"But welcome, as you are. What shall we do?\n"+
		"TAMORA\n"+
		"What wouldst thou have us do, Andronicus?\n"+
		"DEMETRIUS\n"+
		"Show me a murderer, I'll deal with him.\n"+
		"CHIRON\n"+
		"Show me a villain that hath done a rape,\n"+
		"And I am sent to be revenged on him.\n"+
		"TAMORA\n"+
		"Show me a thousand that have done thee wrong,\n"+
		"And I will be revenged on them all.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Look round about the wicked streets of Rome;\n"+
		"And when thou find'st a man that's like thyself.\n"+
		"Good Murder, stab him; he's a murderer.\n"+
		"Go thou with him; and when it is thy hap\n"+
		"To find another that is like to thee,\n"+
		"Good Rapine, stab him; he's a ravisher.\n"+
		"Go thou with them; and in the emperor's court\n"+
		"There is a queen, attended by a Moor;\n"+
		"Well mayst thou know her by thy own proportion,\n"+
		"for up and down she doth resemble thee:\n"+
		"I pray thee, do on them some violent death;\n"+
		"They have been violent to me and mine.\n"+
		"TAMORA\n"+
		"Well hast thou lesson'd us; this shall we do.\n"+
		"But would it please thee, good Andronicus,\n"+
		"To send for Lucius, thy thrice-valiant son,\n"+
		"Who leads towards Rome a band of warlike Goths,\n"+
		"And bid him come and banquet at thy house;\n"+
		"When he is here, even at thy solemn feast,\n"+
		"I will bring in the empress and her sons,\n"+
		"The emperor himself and all thy foes;\n"+
		"And at thy mercy shalt they stoop and kneel,\n"+
		"And on them shalt thou ease thy angry heart.\n"+
		"What says Andronicus to this device?\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Marcus, my brother! 'tis sad Titus calls.\n"+
		"Enter MARCUS\n"+
		"Go, gentle Marcus, to thy nephew Lucius;\n"+
		"Thou shalt inquire him out among the Goths:\n"+
		"Bid him repair to me, and bring with him\n"+
		"Some of the chiefest princes of the Goths;\n"+
		"Bid him encamp his soldiers where they are:\n"+
		"Tell him the emperor and the empress too\n"+
		"Feast at my house, and he shall feast with them.\n"+
		"This do thou for my love; and so let him,\n"+
		"As he regards his aged father's life.\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"This will I do, and soon return again.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"TAMORA\n"+
		"Now will I hence about thy business,\n"+
		"And take my ministers along with me.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Nay, nay, let Rape and Murder stay with me;\n"+
		"Or else I'll call my brother back again,\n"+
		"And cleave to no revenge but Lucius.\n"+
		"TAMORA\n"+
		"[Aside to her sons] What say you, boys? will you\n"+
		"bide with him,\n"+
		"Whiles I go tell my lord the emperor\n"+
		"How I have govern'd our determined jest?\n"+
		"Yield to his humour, smooth and speak him fair,\n"+
		"And tarry with him till I turn again.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"[Aside] I know them all, though they suppose me mad,\n"+
		"And will o'erreach them in their own devices:\n"+
		"A pair of cursed hell-hounds and their dam!\n"+
		"DEMETRIUS\n"+
		"Madam, depart at pleasure; leave us here.\n"+
		"TAMORA\n"+
		"Farewell, Andronicus: Revenge now goes\n"+
		"To lay a complot to betray thy foes.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"I know thou dost; and, sweet Revenge, farewell.\n"+
		"Exit TAMORA\n"+
		"CHIRON\n"+
		"Tell us, old man, how shall we be employ'd?\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Tut, I have work enough for you to do.\n"+
		"Publius, come hither, Caius, and Valentine!\n"+
		"Enter PUBLIUS and others\n"+
		"PUBLIUS\n"+
		"What is your will?\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Know you these two?\n"+
		"PUBLIUS\n"+
		"The empress' sons, I take them, Chiron and Demetrius.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Fie, Publius, fie! thou art too much deceived;\n"+
		"The one is Murder, Rape is the other's name;\n"+
		"And therefore bind them, gentle Publius.\n"+
		"Caius and Valentine, lay hands on them.\n"+
		"Oft have you heard me wish for such an hour,\n"+
		"And now I find it; therefore bind them sure,\n"+
		"And stop their mouths, if they begin to cry.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"PUBLIUS, & c. lay hold on CHIRON and DEMETRIUS\n"+
		"CHIRON\n"+
		"Villains, forbear! we are the empress' sons.\n"+
		"PUBLIUS\n"+
		"And therefore do we what we are commanded.\n"+
		"Stop close their mouths, let them not speak a word.\n"+
		"Is he sure bound? look that you bind them fast.\n"+
		"Re-enter TITUS, with LAVINIA; he bearing a knife, and she a basin\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Come, come, Lavinia; look, thy foes are bound.\n"+
		"Sirs, stop their mouths, let them not speak to me;\n"+
		"But let them hear what fearful words I utter.\n"+
		"O villains, Chiron and Demetrius!\n"+
		"Here stands the spring whom you have stain'd with mud,\n"+
		"This goodly summer with your winter mix'd.\n"+
		"You kill'd her husband, and for that vile fault\n"+
		"Two of her brothers were condemn'd to death,\n"+
		"My hand cut off and made a merry jest;\n"+
		"Both her sweet hands, her tongue, and that more dear\n"+
		"Than hands or tongue, her spotless chastity,\n"+
		"Inhuman traitors, you constrain'd and forced.\n"+
		"What would you say, if I should let you speak?\n"+
		"Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.\n"+
		"Hark, wretches! how I mean to martyr you.\n"+
		"This one hand yet is left to cut your throats,\n"+
		"Whilst that Lavinia 'tween her stumps doth hold\n"+
		"The basin that receives your guilty blood.\n"+
		"You know your mother means to feast with me,\n"+
		"And calls herself Revenge, and thinks me mad:\n"+
		"Hark, villains! I will grind your bones to dust\n"+
		"And with your blood and it I'll make a paste,\n"+
		"And of the paste a coffin I will rear\n"+
		"And make two pasties of your shameful heads,\n"+
		"And bid that strumpet, your unhallow'd dam,\n"+
		"Like to the earth swallow her own increase.\n"+
		"This is the feast that I have bid her to,\n"+
		"And this the banquet she shall surfeit on;\n"+
		"For worse than Philomel you used my daughter,\n"+
		"And worse than Progne I will be revenged:\n"+
		"And now prepare your throats. Lavinia, come,\n"+
		"He cuts their throats\n"+
		"Receive the blood: and when that they are dead,\n"+
		"Let me go grind their bones to powder small\n"+
		"And with this hateful liquor temper it;\n"+
		"And in that paste let their vile heads be baked.\n"+
		"Come, come, be every one officious\n"+
		"To make this banquet; which I wish may prove\n"+
		"More stern and bloody than the Centaurs' feast.\n"+
		"So, now bring them in, for I'll play the cook,\n"+
		"And see them ready 'gainst their mother comes.\n"+
		"Exeunt, bearing the dead bodies\n"+
		"SCENE III. Court of TITUS's house. A banquet set out.\n"+
		"Enter LUCIUS, MARCUS, and Goths, with AARON prisoner\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"Uncle Marcus, since it is my father's mind\n"+
		"That I repair to Rome, I am content.\n"+
		"First Goth\n"+
		"And ours with thine, befall what fortune will.\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"Good uncle, take you in this barbarous Moor,\n"+
		"This ravenous tiger, this accursed devil;\n"+
		"Let him receive no sustenance, fetter him\n"+
		"Till he be brought unto the empress' face,\n"+
		"For testimony of her foul proceedings:\n"+
		"And see the ambush of our friends be strong;\n"+
		"I fear the emperor means no good to us.\n"+
		"AARON\n"+
		"Some devil whisper curses in mine ear,\n"+
		"And prompt me, that my tongue may utter forth\n"+
		"The venomous malice of my swelling heart!\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"Away, inhuman dog! unhallow'd slave!\n"+
		"Sirs, help our uncle to convey him in.\n"+
		"Exeunt Goths, with AARON. Flourish within\n"+
		"The trumpets show the emperor is at hand.\n"+
		"Enter SATURNINUS and TAMORA, with AEMILIUS, Tribunes, Senators, and others\n"+
		"SATURNINUS\n"+
		"What, hath the firmament more suns than one?\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"What boots it thee to call thyself a sun?\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Rome's emperor, and nephew, break the parle;\n"+
		"These quarrels must be quietly debated.\n"+
		"The feast is ready, which the careful Titus\n"+
		"Hath ordain'd to an honourable end,\n"+
		"For peace, for love, for league, and good to Rome:\n"+
		"Please you, therefore, draw nigh, and take your places.\n"+
		"SATURNINUS\n"+
		"Marcus, we will.\n"+
		"Hautboys sound. The Company sit down at table\n"+
		"Enter TITUS dressed like a Cook, LAVINIA veiled, Young LUCIUS, and others. TITUS places the dishes on the table\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Welcome, my gracious lord; welcome, dread queen;\n"+
		"Welcome, ye warlike Goths; welcome, Lucius;\n"+
		"And welcome, all: although the cheer be poor,\n"+
		"'Twill fill your stomachs; please you eat of it.\n"+
		"SATURNINUS\n"+
		"Why art thou thus attired, Andronicus?\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Because I would be sure to have all well,\n"+
		"To entertain your highness and your empress.\n"+
		"TAMORA\n"+
		"We are beholding to you, good Andronicus.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"An if your highness knew my heart, you were.\n"+
		"My lord the emperor, resolve me this:\n"+
		"Was it well done of rash Virginius\n"+
		"To slay his daughter with his own right hand,\n"+
		"Because she was enforced, stain'd, and deflower'd?\n"+
		"SATURNINUS\n"+
		"It was, Andronicus.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Your reason, mighty lord?\n"+
		"SATURNINUS\n"+
		"Because the girl should not survive her shame,\n"+
		"And by her presence still renew his sorrows.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"A reason mighty, strong, and effectual;\n"+
		"A pattern, precedent, and lively warrant,\n"+
		"For me, most wretched, to perform the like.\n"+
		"Die, die, Lavinia, and thy shame with thee;\n"+
		"Kills LAVINIA\n"+
		"And, with thy shame, thy father's sorrow die!\n"+
		"SATURNINUS\n"+
		"What hast thou done, unnatural and unkind?\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Kill'd her, for whom my tears have made me blind.\n"+
		"I am as woful as Virginius was,\n"+
		"And have a thousand times more cause than he\n"+
		"To do this outrage: and it now is done.\n"+
		"SATURNINUS\n"+
		"What, was she ravish'd? tell who did the deed.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Will't please you eat? will't please your\n"+
		"highness feed?\n"+
		"TAMORA\n"+
		"Why hast thou slain thine only daughter thus?\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Not I; 'twas Chiron and Demetrius:\n"+
		"They ravish'd her, and cut away her tongue;\n"+
		"And they, 'twas they, that did her all this wrong.\n"+
		"SATURNINUS\n"+
		"Go fetch them hither to us presently.\n"+
		"TITUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Why, there they are both, baked in that pie;\n"+
		"Whereof their mother daintily hath fed,\n"+
		"Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.\n"+
		"'Tis true, 'tis true; witness my knife's sharp point.\n"+
		"Kills TAMORA\n"+
		"SATURNINUS\n"+
		"Die, frantic wretch, for this accursed deed!\n"+
		"Kills TITUS\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"Can the son's eye behold his father bleed?\n"+
		"There's meed for meed, death for a deadly deed!\n"+
		"Kills SATURNINUS. A great tumult. LUCIUS, MARCUS, and others go up into the balcony\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"You sad-faced men, people and sons of Rome,\n"+
		"By uproar sever'd, like a flight of fowl\n"+
		"Scatter'd by winds and high tempestuous gusts,\n"+
		"O, let me teach you how to knit again\n"+
		"This scatter'd corn into one mutual sheaf,\n"+
		"These broken limbs again into one body;\n"+
		"Lest Rome herself be bane unto herself,\n"+
		"And she whom mighty kingdoms court'sy to,\n"+
		"Like a forlorn and desperate castaway,\n"+
		"Do shameful execution on herself.\n"+
		"But if my frosty signs and chaps of age,\n"+
		"Grave witnesses of true experience,\n"+
		"Cannot induce you to attend my words,\n"+
		"To LUCIUS\n"+
		"Speak, Rome's dear friend, as erst our ancestor,\n"+
		"When with his solemn tongue he did discourse\n"+
		"To love-sick Dido's sad attending ear\n"+
		"The story of that baleful burning night\n"+
		"When subtle Greeks surprised King Priam's Troy,\n"+
		"Tell us what Sinon hath bewitch'd our ears,\n"+
		"Or who hath brought the fatal engine in\n"+
		"That gives our Troy, our Rome, the civil wound.\n"+
		"My heart is not compact of flint nor steel;\n"+
		"Nor can I utter all our bitter grief,\n"+
		"But floods of tears will drown my oratory,\n"+
		"And break my utterance, even in the time\n"+
		"When it should move you to attend me most,\n"+
		"Lending your kind commiseration.\n"+
		"Here is a captain, let him tell the tale;\n"+
		"Your hearts will throb and weep to hear him speak.\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"Then, noble auditory, be it known to you,\n"+
		"That cursed Chiron and Demetrius\n"+
		"Were they that murdered our emperor's brother;\n"+
		"And they it were that ravished our sister:\n"+
		"For their fell faults our brothers were beheaded;\n"+
		"Our father's tears despised, and basely cozen'd\n"+
		"Of that true hand that fought Rome's quarrel out,\n"+
		"And sent her enemies unto the grave.\n"+
		"Lastly, myself unkindly banished,\n"+
		"The gates shut on me, and turn'd weeping out,\n"+
		"To beg relief among Rome's enemies:\n"+
		"Who drown'd their enmity in my true tears.\n"+
		"And oped their arms to embrace me as a friend.\n"+
		"I am the turned forth, be it known to you,\n"+
		"That have preserved her welfare in my blood;\n"+
		"And from her bosom took the enemy's point,\n"+
		"Sheathing the steel in my adventurous body.\n"+
		"Alas, you know I am no vaunter, I;\n"+
		"My scars can witness, dumb although they are,\n"+
		"That my report is just and full of truth.\n"+
		"But, soft! methinks I do digress too much,\n"+
		"Citing my worthless praise: O, pardon me;\n"+
		"For when no friends are by, men praise themselves.\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Now is my turn to speak. Behold this child:\n"+
		"Pointing to the Child in the arms of an Attendant\n"+
		"Of this was Tamora delivered;\n"+
		"The issue of an irreligious Moor,\n"+
		"Chief architect and plotter of these woes:\n"+
		"The villain is alive in Titus' house,\n"+
		"And as he is, to witness this is true.\n"+
		"Now judge what cause had Titus to revenge\n"+
		"These wrongs, unspeakable, past patience,\n"+
		"Or more than any living man could bear.\n"+
		"Now you have heard the truth, what say you, Romans?\n"+
		"Have we done aught amiss,--show us wherein,\n"+
		"And, from the place where you behold us now,\n"+
		"The poor remainder of Andronici\n"+
		"Will, hand in hand, all headlong cast us down.\n"+
		"And on the ragged stones beat forth our brains,\n"+
		"And make a mutual closure of our house.\n"+
		"Speak, Romans, speak; and if you say we shall,\n"+
		"Lo, hand in hand, Lucius and I will fall.\n"+
		"AEMILIUS\n"+
		"Come, come, thou reverend man of Rome,\n"+
		"And bring our emperor gently in thy hand,\n"+
		"Lucius our emperor; for well I know\n"+
		"The common voice do cry it shall be so.\n"+
		"All\n"+
		"Lucius, all hail, Rome's royal emperor!\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Go, go into old Titus' sorrowful house,\n"+
		"To Attendants\n"+
		"And hither hale that misbelieving Moor,\n"+
		"To be adjudged some direful slaughtering death,\n"+
		"As punishment for his most wicked life.\n"+
		"Exeunt Attendants\n"+
		"LUCIUS, MARCUS, and the others descend\n"+
		"All\n"+
		"Lucius, all hail, Rome's gracious governor!\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"Thanks, gentle Romans: may I govern so,\n"+
		"To heal Rome's harms, and wipe away her woe!\n"+
		"But, gentle people, give me aim awhile,\n"+
		"For nature puts me to a heavy task:\n"+
		"Stand all aloof: but, uncle, draw you near,\n"+
		"To shed obsequious tears upon this trunk.\n"+
		"O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips,\n"+
		"Kissing TITUS\n"+
		"These sorrowful drops upon thy blood-stain'd face,\n"+
		"The last true duties of thy noble son!\n"+
		"MARCUS ANDRONICUS\n"+
		"Tear for tear, and loving kiss for kiss,\n"+
		"Thy brother Marcus tenders on thy lips:\n"+
		"O were the sum of these that I should pay\n"+
		"Countless and infinite, yet would I pay them!\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"Come hither, boy; come, come, and learn of us\n"+
		"To melt in showers: thy grandsire loved thee well:\n"+
		"Many a time he danced thee on his knee,\n"+
		"Sung thee asleep, his loving breast thy pillow:\n"+
		"Many a matter hath he told to thee,\n"+
		"Meet and agreeing with thine infancy;\n"+
		"In that respect, then, like a loving child,\n"+
		"Shed yet some small drops from thy tender spring,\n"+
		"Because kind nature doth require it so:\n"+
		"Friends should associate friends in grief and woe:\n"+
		"Bid him farewell; commit him to the grave;\n"+
		"Do him that kindness, and take leave of him.\n"+
		"Young LUCIUS\n"+
		"O grandsire, grandsire! even with all my heart\n"+
		"Would I were dead, so you did live again!\n"+
		"O Lord, I cannot speak to him for weeping;\n"+
		"My tears will choke me, if I ope my mouth.\n"+
		"Re-enter Attendants with AARON\n"+
		"AEMILIUS\n"+
		"You sad Andronici, have done with woes:\n"+
		"Give sentence on this execrable wretch,\n"+
		"That hath been breeder of these dire events.\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"Set him breast-deep in earth, and famish him;\n"+
		"There let him stand, and rave, and cry for food;\n"+
		"If any one relieves or pities him,\n"+
		"For the offence he dies. This is our doom:\n"+
		"Some stay to see him fasten'd in the earth.\n"+
		"AARON\n"+
		"O, why should wrath be mute, and fury dumb?\n"+
		"I am no baby, I, that with base prayers\n"+
		"I should repent the evils I have done:\n"+
		"Ten thousand worse than ever yet I did\n"+
		"Would I perform, if I might have my will;\n"+
		"If one good deed in all my life I did,\n"+
		"I do repent it from my very soul.\n"+
		"LUCIUS\n"+
		"Some loving friends convey the emperor hence,\n"+
		"And give him burial in his father's grave:\n"+
		"My father and Lavinia shall forthwith\n"+
		"Be closed in our household's monument.\n"+
		"As for that heinous tiger, Tamora,\n"+
		"No funeral rite, nor man in mourning weeds,\n"+
		"No mournful bell shall ring her burial;\n"+
		"But throw her forth to beasts and birds of prey:\n"+
		"Her life was beast-like, and devoid of pity;\n"+
		"And, being so, shall have like want of pity.\n"+
		"See justice done on Aaron, that damn'd Moor,\n"+
		"By whom our heavy haps had their beginning:\n"+
		"Then, afterwards, to order well the state,\n"+
		"That like events may ne'er it ruinate.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"
