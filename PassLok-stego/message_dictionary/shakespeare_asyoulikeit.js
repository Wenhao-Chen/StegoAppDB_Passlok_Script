		"As You Like It\n"+
		"ACT I\n"+
		"SCENE I. Orchard of Oliver's house.\n"+
		"Enter ORLANDO and ADAM\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion\n"+
		"bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,\n"+
		"and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his\n"+
		"blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my\n"+
		"sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and\n"+
		"report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,\n"+
		"he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more\n"+
		"properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you\n"+
		"that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that\n"+
		"differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses\n"+
		"are bred better; for, besides that they are fair\n"+
		"with their feeding, they are taught their manage,\n"+
		"and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his\n"+
		"brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the\n"+
		"which his animals on his dunghills are as much\n"+
		"bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so\n"+
		"plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave\n"+
		"me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets\n"+
		"me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a\n"+
		"brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my\n"+
		"gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that\n"+
		"grieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I\n"+
		"think is within me, begins to mutiny against this\n"+
		"servitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet I\n"+
		"know no wise remedy how to avoid it.\n"+
		"ADAM\n"+
		"Yonder comes my master, your brother.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will\n"+
		"shake me up.\n"+
		"Enter OLIVER\n"+
		"OLIVER\n"+
		"Now, sir! what make you here?\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Nothing: I am not taught to make any thing.\n"+
		"OLIVER\n"+
		"What mar you then, sir?\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God\n"+
		"made, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.\n"+
		"OLIVER\n"+
		"Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?\n"+
		"What prodigal portion have I spent, that I should\n"+
		"come to such penury?\n"+
		"OLIVER\n"+
		"Know you where your are, sir?\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"O, sir, very well; here in your orchard.\n"+
		"OLIVER\n"+
		"Know you before whom, sir?\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know\n"+
		"you are my eldest brother; and, in the gentle\n"+
		"condition of blood, you should so know me. The\n"+
		"courtesy of nations allows you my better, in that\n"+
		"you are the first-born; but the same tradition\n"+
		"takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers\n"+
		"betwixt us: I have as much of my father in me as\n"+
		"you; albeit, I confess, your coming before me is\n"+
		"nearer to his reverence.\n"+
		"OLIVER\n"+
		"What, boy!\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.\n"+
		"OLIVER\n"+
		"Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"I am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir\n"+
		"Rowland de Boys; he was my father, and he is thrice\n"+
		"a villain that says such a father begot villains.\n"+
		"Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand\n"+
		"from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy\n"+
		"tongue for saying so: thou hast railed on thyself.\n"+
		"ADAM\n"+
		"Sweet masters, be patient: for your father's\n"+
		"remembrance, be at accord.\n"+
		"OLIVER\n"+
		"Let me go, I say.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"I will not, till I please: you shall hear me. My\n"+
		"father charged you in his will to give me good\n"+
		"education: you have trained me like a peasant,\n"+
		"obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like\n"+
		"qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in\n"+
		"me, and I will no longer endure it: therefore allow\n"+
		"me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or\n"+
		"give me the poor allottery my father left me by\n"+
		"testament; with that I will go buy my fortunes.\n"+
		"OLIVER\n"+
		"And what wilt thou do? beg, when that is spent?\n"+
		"Well, sir, get you in: I will not long be troubled\n"+
		"with you; you shall have some part of your will: I\n"+
		"pray you, leave me.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"I will no further offend you than becomes me for my good.\n"+
		"OLIVER\n"+
		"Get you with him, you old dog.\n"+
		"ADAM\n"+
		"Is 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost my\n"+
		"teeth in your service. God be with my old master!\n"+
		"he would not have spoke such a word.\n"+
		"Exeunt ORLANDO and ADAM\n"+
		"OLIVER\n"+
		"Is it even so? begin you to grow upon me? I will\n"+
		"physic your rankness, and yet give no thousand\n"+
		"crowns neither. Holla, Dennis!\n"+
		"Enter DENNIS\n"+
		"DENNIS\n"+
		"Calls your worship?\n"+
		"OLIVER\n"+
		"Was not Charles, the duke's wrestler, here to speak with me?\n"+
		"DENNIS\n"+
		"So please you, he is here at the door and importunes\n"+
		"access to you.\n"+
		"OLIVER\n"+
		"Call him in.\n"+
		"Exit DENNIS\n"+
		"'Twill be a good way; and to-morrow the wrestling is.\n"+
		"Enter CHARLES\n"+
		"CHARLES\n"+
		"Good morrow to your worship.\n"+
		"OLIVER\n"+
		"Good Monsieur Charles, what's the new news at the\n"+
		"new court?\n"+
		"CHARLES\n"+
		"There's no news at the court, sir, but the old news:\n"+
		"that is, the old duke is banished by his younger\n"+
		"brother the new duke; and three or four loving lords\n"+
		"have put themselves into voluntary exile with him,\n"+
		"whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke;\n"+
		"therefore he gives them good leave to wander.\n"+
		"OLIVER\n"+
		"Can you tell if Rosalind, the duke's daughter, be\n"+
		"banished with her father?\n"+
		"CHARLES\n"+
		"O, no; for the duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves\n"+
		"her, being ever from their cradles bred together,\n"+
		"that she would have followed her exile, or have died\n"+
		"to stay behind her. She is at the court, and no\n"+
		"less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter; and\n"+
		"never two ladies loved as they do.\n"+
		"OLIVER\n"+
		"Where will the old duke live?\n"+
		"CHARLES\n"+
		"They say he is already in the forest of Arden, and\n"+
		"a many merry men with him; and there they live like\n"+
		"the old Robin Hood of England: they say many young\n"+
		"gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time\n"+
		"carelessly, as they did in the golden world.\n"+
		"OLIVER\n"+
		"What, you wrestle to-morrow before the new duke?\n"+
		"CHARLES\n"+
		"Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a\n"+
		"matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand\n"+
		"that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition\n"+
		"to come in disguised against me to try a fall.\n"+
		"To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he that\n"+
		"escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him\n"+
		"well. Your brother is but young and tender; and,\n"+
		"for your love, I would be loath to foil him, as I\n"+
		"must, for my own honour, if he come in: therefore,\n"+
		"out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you\n"+
		"withal, that either you might stay him from his\n"+
		"intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall\n"+
		"run into, in that it is a thing of his own search\n"+
		"and altogether against my will.\n"+
		"OLIVER\n"+
		"Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which\n"+
		"thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had\n"+
		"myself notice of my brother's purpose herein and\n"+
		"have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from\n"+
		"it, but he is resolute. I'll tell thee, Charles:\n"+
		"it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full\n"+
		"of ambition, an envious emulator of every man's\n"+
		"good parts, a secret and villanous contriver against\n"+
		"me his natural brother: therefore use thy\n"+
		"discretion; I had as lief thou didst break his neck\n"+
		"as his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for if\n"+
		"thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not\n"+
		"mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise\n"+
		"against thee by poison, entrap thee by some\n"+
		"treacherous device and never leave thee till he\n"+
		"hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other;\n"+
		"for, I assure thee, and almost with tears I speak\n"+
		"it, there is not one so young and so villanous this\n"+
		"day living. I speak but brotherly of him; but\n"+
		"should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must\n"+
		"blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder.\n"+
		"CHARLES\n"+
		"I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come\n"+
		"to-morrow, I'll give him his payment: if ever he go\n"+
		"alone again, I'll never wrestle for prize more: and\n"+
		"so God keep your worship!\n"+
		"OLIVER\n"+
		"Farewell, good Charles.\n"+
		"Exit CHARLES\n"+
		"Now will I stir this gamester: I hope I shall see\n"+
		"an end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why,\n"+
		"hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle, never\n"+
		"schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of\n"+
		"all sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much\n"+
		"in the heart of the world, and especially of my own\n"+
		"people, who best know him, that I am altogether\n"+
		"misprised: but it shall not be so long; this\n"+
		"wrestler shall clear all: nothing remains but that\n"+
		"I kindle the boy thither; which now I'll go about.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE II. Lawn before the Duke's palace.\n"+
		"Enter CELIA and ROSALIND\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of;\n"+
		"and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could\n"+
		"teach me to forget a banished father, you must not\n"+
		"learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight\n"+
		"that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father,\n"+
		"had banished thy uncle, the duke my father, so thou\n"+
		"hadst been still with me, I could have taught my\n"+
		"love to take thy father for mine: so wouldst thou,\n"+
		"if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously\n"+
		"tempered as mine is to thee.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to\n"+
		"rejoice in yours.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is\n"+
		"like to have: and, truly, when he dies, thou shalt\n"+
		"be his heir, for what he hath taken away from thy\n"+
		"father perforce, I will render thee again in\n"+
		"affection; by mine honour, I will; and when I break\n"+
		"that oath, let me turn monster: therefore, my\n"+
		"sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports. Let\n"+
		"me see; what think you of falling in love?\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal: but\n"+
		"love no man in good earnest; nor no further in sport\n"+
		"neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst\n"+
		"in honour come off again.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"What shall be our sport, then?\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from\n"+
		"her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"I would we could do so, for her benefits are\n"+
		"mightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman\n"+
		"doth most mistake in her gifts to women.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"'Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce\n"+
		"makes honest, and those that she makes honest she\n"+
		"makes very ill-favouredly.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Nay, now thou goest from Fortune's office to\n"+
		"Nature's: Fortune reigns in gifts of the world,\n"+
		"not in the lineaments of Nature.\n"+
		"Enter TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"No? when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she\n"+
		"not by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature\n"+
		"hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not\n"+
		"Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when\n"+
		"Fortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off of\n"+
		"Nature's wit.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"Peradventure this is not Fortune's work neither, but\n"+
		"Nature's; who perceiveth our natural wits too dull\n"+
		"to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this\n"+
		"natural for our whetstone; for always the dulness of\n"+
		"the fool is the whetstone of the wits. How now,\n"+
		"wit! whither wander you?\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"Mistress, you must come away to your father.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"Were you made the messenger?\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"No, by mine honour, but I was bid to come for you.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Where learned you that oath, fool?\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they\n"+
		"were good pancakes and swore by his honour the\n"+
		"mustard was naught: now I'll stand to it, the\n"+
		"pancakes were naught and the mustard was good, and\n"+
		"yet was not the knight forsworn.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"How prove you that, in the great heap of your\n"+
		"knowledge?\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and\n"+
		"swear by your beards that I am a knave.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"By our beards, if we had them, thou art.\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"By my knavery, if I had it, then I were; but if you\n"+
		"swear by that that is not, you are not forsworn: no\n"+
		"more was this knight swearing by his honour, for he\n"+
		"never had any; or if he had, he had sworn it away\n"+
		"before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"Prithee, who is't that thou meanest?\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"One that old Frederick, your father, loves.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"My father's love is enough to honour him: enough!\n"+
		"speak no more of him; you'll be whipped for taxation\n"+
		"one of these days.\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"The more pity, that fools may not speak wisely what\n"+
		"wise men do foolishly.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"By my troth, thou sayest true; for since the little\n"+
		"wit that fools have was silenced, the little foolery\n"+
		"that wise men have makes a great show. Here comes\n"+
		"Monsieur Le Beau.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"With his mouth full of news.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"Which he will put on us, as pigeons feed their young.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Then shall we be news-crammed.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"All the better; we shall be the more marketable.\n"+
		"Enter LE BEAU\n"+
		"Bon jour, Monsieur Le Beau: what's the news?\n"+
		"LE BEAU\n"+
		"Fair princess, you have lost much good sport.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"Sport! of what colour?\n"+
		"LE BEAU\n"+
		"What colour, madam! how shall I answer you?\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"As wit and fortune will.\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"Or as the Destinies decree.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"Well said: that was laid on with a trowel.\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"Nay, if I keep not my rank,--\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Thou losest thy old smell.\n"+
		"LE BEAU\n"+
		"You amaze me, ladies: I would have told you of good\n"+
		"wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"You tell us the manner of the wrestling.\n"+
		"LE BEAU\n"+
		"I will tell you the beginning; and, if it please\n"+
		"your ladyships, you may see the end; for the best is\n"+
		"yet to do; and here, where you are, they are coming\n"+
		"to perform it.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.\n"+
		"LE BEAU\n"+
		"There comes an old man and his three sons,--\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"I could match this beginning with an old tale.\n"+
		"LE BEAU\n"+
		"Three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"With bills on their necks, 'Be it known unto all men\n"+
		"by these presents.'\n"+
		"LE BEAU\n"+
		"The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the\n"+
		"duke's wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw him\n"+
		"and broke three of his ribs, that there is little\n"+
		"hope of life in him: so he served the second, and\n"+
		"so the third. Yonder they lie; the poor old man,\n"+
		"their father, making such pitiful dole over them\n"+
		"that all the beholders take his part with weeping.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Alas!\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies\n"+
		"have lost?\n"+
		"LE BEAU\n"+
		"Why, this that I speak of.\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"Thus men may grow wiser every day: it is the first\n"+
		"time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport\n"+
		"for ladies.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"Or I, I promise thee.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"But is there any else longs to see this broken music\n"+
		"in his sides? is there yet another dotes upon\n"+
		"rib-breaking? Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?\n"+
		"LE BEAU\n"+
		"You must, if you stay here; for here is the place\n"+
		"appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to\n"+
		"perform it.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"Yonder, sure, they are coming: let us now stay and see it.\n"+
		"Flourish. Enter DUKE FREDERICK, Lords, ORLANDO, CHARLES, and Attendants\n"+
		"DUKE FREDERICK\n"+
		"Come on: since the youth will not be entreated, his\n"+
		"own peril on his forwardness.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Is yonder the man?\n"+
		"LE BEAU\n"+
		"Even he, madam.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"Alas, he is too young! yet he looks successfully.\n"+
		"DUKE FREDERICK\n"+
		"How now, daughter and cousin! are you crept hither\n"+
		"to see the wrestling?\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Ay, my liege, so please you give us leave.\n"+
		"DUKE FREDERICK\n"+
		"You will take little delight in it, I can tell you;\n"+
		"there is such odds in the man. In pity of the\n"+
		"challenger's youth I would fain dissuade him, but he\n"+
		"will not be entreated. Speak to him, ladies; see if\n"+
		"you can move him.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.\n"+
		"DUKE FREDERICK\n"+
		"Do so: I'll not be by.\n"+
		"LE BEAU\n"+
		"Monsieur the challenger, the princesses call for you.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"I attend them with all respect and duty.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Young man, have you challenged Charles the wrestler?\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"No, fair princess; he is the general challenger: I\n"+
		"come but in, as others do, to try with him the\n"+
		"strength of my youth.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your\n"+
		"years. You have seen cruel proof of this man's\n"+
		"strength: if you saw yourself with your eyes or\n"+
		"knew yourself with your judgment, the fear of your\n"+
		"adventure would counsel you to a more equal\n"+
		"enterprise. We pray you, for your own sake, to\n"+
		"embrace your own safety and give over this attempt.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Do, young sir; your reputation shall not therefore\n"+
		"be misprised: we will make it our suit to the duke\n"+
		"that the wrestling might not go forward.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"I beseech you, punish me not with your hard\n"+
		"thoughts; wherein I confess me much guilty, to deny\n"+
		"so fair and excellent ladies any thing. But let\n"+
		"your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my\n"+
		"trial: wherein if I be foiled, there is but one\n"+
		"shamed that was never gracious; if killed, but one\n"+
		"dead that was willing to be so: I shall do my\n"+
		"friends no wrong, for I have none to lament me, the\n"+
		"world no injury, for in it I have nothing; only in\n"+
		"the world I fill up a place, which may be better\n"+
		"supplied when I have made it empty.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"The little strength that I have, I would it were with you.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"And mine, to eke out hers.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Fare you well: pray heaven I be deceived in you!\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"Your heart's desires be with you!\n"+
		"CHARLES\n"+
		"Come, where is this young gallant that is so\n"+
		"desirous to lie with his mother earth?\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Ready, sir; but his will hath in it a more modest working.\n"+
		"DUKE FREDERICK\n"+
		"You shall try but one fall.\n"+
		"CHARLES\n"+
		"No, I warrant your grace, you shall not entreat him\n"+
		"to a second, that have so mightily persuaded him\n"+
		"from a first.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"An you mean to mock me after, you should not have\n"+
		"mocked me before: but come your ways.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Now Hercules be thy speed, young man!\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"I would I were invisible, to catch the strong\n"+
		"fellow by the leg.\n"+
		"They wrestle\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"O excellent young man!\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who\n"+
		"should down.\n"+
		"Shout. CHARLES is thrown\n"+
		"DUKE FREDERICK\n"+
		"No more, no more.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Yes, I beseech your grace: I am not yet well breathed.\n"+
		"DUKE FREDERICK\n"+
		"How dost thou, Charles?\n"+
		"LE BEAU\n"+
		"He cannot speak, my lord.\n"+
		"DUKE FREDERICK\n"+
		"Bear him away. What is thy name, young man?\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Orlando, my liege; the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys.\n"+
		"DUKE FREDERICK\n"+
		"I would thou hadst been son to some man else:\n"+
		"The world esteem'd thy father honourable,\n"+
		"But I did find him still mine enemy:\n"+
		"Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed,\n"+
		"Hadst thou descended from another house.\n"+
		"But fare thee well; thou art a gallant youth:\n"+
		"I would thou hadst told me of another father.\n"+
		"Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK, train, and LE BEAU\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"Were I my father, coz, would I do this?\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son,\n"+
		"His youngest son; and would not change that calling,\n"+
		"To be adopted heir to Frederick.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul,\n"+
		"And all the world was of my father's mind:\n"+
		"Had I before known this young man his son,\n"+
		"I should have given him tears unto entreaties,\n"+
		"Ere he should thus have ventured.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"Gentle cousin,\n"+
		"Let us go thank him and encourage him:\n"+
		"My father's rough and envious disposition\n"+
		"Sticks me at heart. Sir, you have well deserved:\n"+
		"If you do keep your promises in love\n"+
		"But justly, as you have exceeded all promise,\n"+
		"Your mistress shall be happy.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Gentleman,\n"+
		"Giving him a chain from her neck\n"+
		"Wear this for me, one out of suits with fortune,\n"+
		"That could give more, but that her hand lacks means.\n"+
		"Shall we go, coz?\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"Ay. Fare you well, fair gentleman.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Can I not say, I thank you? My better parts\n"+
		"Are all thrown down, and that which here stands up\n"+
		"Is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"He calls us back: my pride fell with my fortunes;\n"+
		"I'll ask him what he would. Did you call, sir?\n"+
		"Sir, you have wrestled well and overthrown\n"+
		"More than your enemies.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"Will you go, coz?\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Have with you. Fare you well.\n"+
		"Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?\n"+
		"I cannot speak to her, yet she urged conference.\n"+
		"O poor Orlando, thou art overthrown!\n"+
		"Or Charles or something weaker masters thee.\n"+
		"Re-enter LE BEAU\n"+
		"LE BEAU\n"+
		"Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you\n"+
		"To leave this place. Albeit you have deserved\n"+
		"High commendation, true applause and love,\n"+
		"Yet such is now the duke's condition\n"+
		"That he misconstrues all that you have done.\n"+
		"The duke is humorous; what he is indeed,\n"+
		"More suits you to conceive than I to speak of.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"I thank you, sir: and, pray you, tell me this:\n"+
		"Which of the two was daughter of the duke\n"+
		"That here was at the wrestling?\n"+
		"LE BEAU\n"+
		"Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners;\n"+
		"But yet indeed the lesser is his daughter\n"+
		"The other is daughter to the banish'd duke,\n"+
		"And here detain'd by her usurping uncle,\n"+
		"To keep his daughter company; whose loves\n"+
		"Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters.\n"+
		"But I can tell you that of late this duke\n"+
		"Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece,\n"+
		"Grounded upon no other argument\n"+
		"But that the people praise her for her virtues\n"+
		"And pity her for her good father's sake;\n"+
		"And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady\n"+
		"Will suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well:\n"+
		"Hereafter, in a better world than this,\n"+
		"I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"I rest much bounden to you: fare you well.\n"+
		"Exit LE BEAU\n"+
		"Thus must I from the smoke into the smother;\n"+
		"From tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother:\n"+
		"But heavenly Rosalind!\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE III. A room in the palace.\n"+
		"Enter CELIA and ROSALIND\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"Why, cousin! why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy! not a word?\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Not one to throw at a dog.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"No, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon\n"+
		"curs; throw some of them at me; come, lame me with reasons.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Then there were two cousins laid up; when the one\n"+
		"should be lamed with reasons and the other mad\n"+
		"without any.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"But is all this for your father?\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"No, some of it is for my child's father. O, how\n"+
		"full of briers is this working-day world!\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in\n"+
		"holiday foolery: if we walk not in the trodden\n"+
		"paths our very petticoats will catch them.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"I could shake them off my coat: these burs are in my heart.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"Hem them away.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"I would try, if I could cry 'hem' and have him.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"O, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself!\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"O, a good wish upon you! you will try in time, in\n"+
		"despite of a fall. But, turning these jests out of\n"+
		"service, let us talk in good earnest: is it\n"+
		"possible, on such a sudden, you should fall into so\n"+
		"strong a liking with old Sir Rowland's youngest son?\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"The duke my father loved his father dearly.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son\n"+
		"dearly? By this kind of chase, I should hate him,\n"+
		"for my father hated his father dearly; yet I hate\n"+
		"not Orlando.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"Why should I not? doth he not deserve well?\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Let me love him for that, and do you love him\n"+
		"because I do. Look, here comes the duke.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"With his eyes full of anger.\n"+
		"Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with Lords\n"+
		"DUKE FREDERICK\n"+
		"Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste\n"+
		"And get you from our court.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Me, uncle?\n"+
		"DUKE FREDERICK\n"+
		"You, cousin\n"+
		"Within these ten days if that thou be'st found\n"+
		"So near our public court as twenty miles,\n"+
		"Thou diest for it.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"I do beseech your grace,\n"+
		"Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me:\n"+
		"If with myself I hold intelligence\n"+
		"Or have acquaintance with mine own desires,\n"+
		"If that I do not dream or be not frantic,--\n"+
		"As I do trust I am not--then, dear uncle,\n"+
		"Never so much as in a thought unborn\n"+
		"Did I offend your highness.\n"+
		"DUKE FREDERICK\n"+
		"Thus do all traitors:\n"+
		"If their purgation did consist in words,\n"+
		"They are as innocent as grace itself:\n"+
		"Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor:\n"+
		"Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.\n"+
		"DUKE FREDERICK\n"+
		"Thou art thy father's daughter; there's enough.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"So was I when your highness took his dukedom;\n"+
		"So was I when your highness banish'd him:\n"+
		"Treason is not inherited, my lord;\n"+
		"Or, if we did derive it from our friends,\n"+
		"What's that to me? my father was no traitor:\n"+
		"Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much\n"+
		"To think my poverty is treacherous.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"Dear sovereign, hear me speak.\n"+
		"DUKE FREDERICK\n"+
		"Ay, Celia; we stay'd her for your sake,\n"+
		"Else had she with her father ranged along.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"I did not then entreat to have her stay;\n"+
		"It was your pleasure and your own remorse:\n"+
		"I was too young that time to value her;\n"+
		"But now I know her: if she be a traitor,\n"+
		"Why so am I; we still have slept together,\n"+
		"Rose at an instant, learn'd, play'd, eat together,\n"+
		"And wheresoever we went, like Juno's swans,\n"+
		"Still we went coupled and inseparable.\n"+
		"DUKE FREDERICK\n"+
		"She is too subtle for thee; and her smoothness,\n"+
		"Her very silence and her patience\n"+
		"Speak to the people, and they pity her.\n"+
		"Thou art a fool: she robs thee of thy name;\n"+
		"And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous\n"+
		"When she is gone. Then open not thy lips:\n"+
		"Firm and irrevocable is my doom\n"+
		"Which I have pass'd upon her; she is banish'd.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"Pronounce that sentence then on me, my liege:\n"+
		"I cannot live out of her company.\n"+
		"DUKE FREDERICK\n"+
		"You are a fool. You, niece, provide yourself:\n"+
		"If you outstay the time, upon mine honour,\n"+
		"And in the greatness of my word, you die.\n"+
		"Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK and Lords\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"O my poor Rosalind, whither wilt thou go?\n"+
		"Wilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine.\n"+
		"I charge thee, be not thou more grieved than I am.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"I have more cause.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"Thou hast not, cousin;\n"+
		"Prithee be cheerful: know'st thou not, the duke\n"+
		"Hath banish'd me, his daughter?\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"That he hath not.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"No, hath not? Rosalind lacks then the love\n"+
		"Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one:\n"+
		"Shall we be sunder'd? shall we part, sweet girl?\n"+
		"No: let my father seek another heir.\n"+
		"Therefore devise with me how we may fly,\n"+
		"Whither to go and what to bear with us;\n"+
		"And do not seek to take your change upon you,\n"+
		"To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out;\n"+
		"For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,\n"+
		"Say what thou canst, I'll go along with thee.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Why, whither shall we go?\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"To seek my uncle in the forest of Arden.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Alas, what danger will it be to us,\n"+
		"Maids as we are, to travel forth so far!\n"+
		"Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"I'll put myself in poor and mean attire\n"+
		"And with a kind of umber smirch my face;\n"+
		"The like do you: so shall we pass along\n"+
		"And never stir assailants.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Were it not better,\n"+
		"Because that I am more than common tall,\n"+
		"That I did suit me all points like a man?\n"+
		"A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,\n"+
		"A boar-spear in my hand; and--in my heart\n"+
		"Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will--\n"+
		"We'll have a swashing and a martial outside,\n"+
		"As many other mannish cowards have\n"+
		"That do outface it with their semblances.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"What shall I call thee when thou art a man?\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"I'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page;\n"+
		"And therefore look you call me Ganymede.\n"+
		"But what will you be call'd?\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"Something that hath a reference to my state\n"+
		"No longer Celia, but Aliena.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"But, cousin, what if we assay'd to steal\n"+
		"The clownish fool out of your father's court?\n"+
		"Would he not be a comfort to our travel?\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"He'll go along o'er the wide world with me;\n"+
		"Leave me alone to woo him. Let's away,\n"+
		"And get our jewels and our wealth together,\n"+
		"Devise the fittest time and safest way\n"+
		"To hide us from pursuit that will be made\n"+
		"After my flight. Now go we in content\n"+
		"To liberty and not to banishment.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT II\n"+
		"SCENE I. The Forest of Arden.\n"+
		"Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and two or three Lords, like foresters\n"+
		"DUKE SENIOR\n"+
		"Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile,\n"+
		"Hath not old custom made this life more sweet\n"+
		"Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods\n"+
		"More free from peril than the envious court?\n"+
		"Here feel we but the penalty of Adam,\n"+
		"The seasons' difference, as the icy fang\n"+
		"And churlish chiding of the winter's wind,\n"+
		"Which, when it bites and blows upon my body,\n"+
		"Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say\n"+
		"'This is no flattery: these are counsellors\n"+
		"That feelingly persuade me what I am.'\n"+
		"Sweet are the uses of adversity,\n"+
		"Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,\n"+
		"Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;\n"+
		"And this our life exempt from public haunt\n"+
		"Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,\n"+
		"Sermons in stones and good in every thing.\n"+
		"I would not change it.\n"+
		"AMIENS\n"+
		"Happy is your grace,\n"+
		"That can translate the stubbornness of fortune\n"+
		"Into so quiet and so sweet a style.\n"+
		"DUKE SENIOR\n"+
		"Come, shall we go and kill us venison?\n"+
		"And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,\n"+
		"Being native burghers of this desert city,\n"+
		"Should in their own confines with forked heads\n"+
		"Have their round haunches gored.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"Indeed, my lord,\n"+
		"The melancholy Jaques grieves at that,\n"+
		"And, in that kind, swears you do more usurp\n"+
		"Than doth your brother that hath banish'd you.\n"+
		"To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself\n"+
		"Did steal behind him as he lay along\n"+
		"Under an oak whose antique root peeps out\n"+
		"Upon the brook that brawls along this wood:\n"+
		"To the which place a poor sequester'd stag,\n"+
		"That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt,\n"+
		"Did come to languish, and indeed, my lord,\n"+
		"The wretched animal heaved forth such groans\n"+
		"That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat\n"+
		"Almost to bursting, and the big round tears\n"+
		"Coursed one another down his innocent nose\n"+
		"In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool\n"+
		"Much marked of the melancholy Jaques,\n"+
		"Stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook,\n"+
		"Augmenting it with tears.\n"+
		"DUKE SENIOR\n"+
		"But what said Jaques?\n"+
		"Did he not moralize this spectacle?\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"O, yes, into a thousand similes.\n"+
		"First, for his weeping into the needless stream;\n"+
		"'Poor deer,' quoth he, 'thou makest a testament\n"+
		"As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more\n"+
		"To that which had too much:' then, being there alone,\n"+
		"Left and abandon'd of his velvet friends,\n"+
		"''Tis right:' quoth he; 'thus misery doth part\n"+
		"The flux of company:' anon a careless herd,\n"+
		"Full of the pasture, jumps along by him\n"+
		"And never stays to greet him; 'Ay' quoth Jaques,\n"+
		"'Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens;\n"+
		"'Tis just the fashion: wherefore do you look\n"+
		"Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?'\n"+
		"Thus most invectively he pierceth through\n"+
		"The body of the country, city, court,\n"+
		"Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we\n"+
		"Are mere usurpers, tyrants and what's worse,\n"+
		"To fright the animals and to kill them up\n"+
		"In their assign'd and native dwelling-place.\n"+
		"DUKE SENIOR\n"+
		"And did you leave him in this contemplation?\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"We did, my lord, weeping and commenting\n"+
		"Upon the sobbing deer.\n"+
		"DUKE SENIOR\n"+
		"Show me the place:\n"+
		"I love to cope him in these sullen fits,\n"+
		"For then he's full of matter.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"I'll bring you to him straight.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. A room in the palace.\n"+
		"Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with Lords\n"+
		"DUKE FREDERICK\n"+
		"Can it be possible that no man saw them?\n"+
		"It cannot be: some villains of my court\n"+
		"Are of consent and sufferance in this.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"I cannot hear of any that did see her.\n"+
		"The ladies, her attendants of her chamber,\n"+
		"Saw her abed, and in the morning early\n"+
		"They found the bed untreasured of their mistress.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"My lord, the roynish clown, at whom so oft\n"+
		"Your grace was wont to laugh, is also missing.\n"+
		"Hisperia, the princess' gentlewoman,\n"+
		"Confesses that she secretly o'erheard\n"+
		"Your daughter and her cousin much commend\n"+
		"The parts and graces of the wrestler\n"+
		"That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles;\n"+
		"And she believes, wherever they are gone,\n"+
		"That youth is surely in their company.\n"+
		"DUKE FREDERICK\n"+
		"Send to his brother; fetch that gallant hither;\n"+
		"If he be absent, bring his brother to me;\n"+
		"I'll make him find him: do this suddenly,\n"+
		"And let not search and inquisition quail\n"+
		"To bring again these foolish runaways.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. Before OLIVER'S house.\n"+
		"Enter ORLANDO and ADAM, meeting\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Who's there?\n"+
		"ADAM\n"+
		"What, my young master? O, my gentle master!\n"+
		"O my sweet master! O you memory\n"+
		"Of old Sir Rowland! why, what make you here?\n"+
		"Why are you virtuous? why do people love you?\n"+
		"And wherefore are you gentle, strong and valiant?\n"+
		"Why would you be so fond to overcome\n"+
		"The bonny priser of the humorous duke?\n"+
		"Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.\n"+
		"Know you not, master, to some kind of men\n"+
		"Their graces serve them but as enemies?\n"+
		"No more do yours: your virtues, gentle master,\n"+
		"Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.\n"+
		"O, what a world is this, when what is comely\n"+
		"Envenoms him that bears it!\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Why, what's the matter?\n"+
		"ADAM\n"+
		"O unhappy youth!\n"+
		"Come not within these doors; within this roof\n"+
		"The enemy of all your graces lives:\n"+
		"Your brother--no, no brother; yet the son--\n"+
		"Yet not the son, I will not call him son\n"+
		"Of him I was about to call his father--\n"+
		"Hath heard your praises, and this night he means\n"+
		"To burn the lodging where you use to lie\n"+
		"And you within it: if he fail of that,\n"+
		"He will have other means to cut you off.\n"+
		"I overheard him and his practises.\n"+
		"This is no place; this house is but a butchery:\n"+
		"Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?\n"+
		"ADAM\n"+
		"No matter whither, so you come not here.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food?\n"+
		"Or with a base and boisterous sword enforce\n"+
		"A thievish living on the common road?\n"+
		"This I must do, or know not what to do:\n"+
		"Yet this I will not do, do how I can;\n"+
		"I rather will subject me to the malice\n"+
		"Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.\n"+
		"ADAM\n"+
		"But do not so. I have five hundred crowns,\n"+
		"The thrifty hire I saved under your father,\n"+
		"Which I did store to be my foster-nurse\n"+
		"When service should in my old limbs lie lame\n"+
		"And unregarded age in corners thrown:\n"+
		"Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,\n"+
		"Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,\n"+
		"Be comfort to my age! Here is the gold;\n"+
		"And all this I give you. Let me be your servant:\n"+
		"Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty;\n"+
		"For in my youth I never did apply\n"+
		"Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,\n"+
		"Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo\n"+
		"The means of weakness and debility;\n"+
		"Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,\n"+
		"Frosty, but kindly: let me go with you;\n"+
		"I'll do the service of a younger man\n"+
		"In all your business and necessities.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"O good old man, how well in thee appears\n"+
		"The constant service of the antique world,\n"+
		"When service sweat for duty, not for meed!\n"+
		"Thou art not for the fashion of these times,\n"+
		"Where none will sweat but for promotion,\n"+
		"And having that, do choke their service up\n"+
		"Even with the having: it is not so with thee.\n"+
		"But, poor old man, thou prunest a rotten tree,\n"+
		"That cannot so much as a blossom yield\n"+
		"In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry\n"+
		"But come thy ways; well go along together,\n"+
		"And ere we have thy youthful wages spent,\n"+
		"We'll light upon some settled low content.\n"+
		"ADAM\n"+
		"Master, go on, and I will follow thee,\n"+
		"To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty.\n"+
		"From seventeen years till now almost fourscore\n"+
		"Here lived I, but now live here no more.\n"+
		"At seventeen years many their fortunes seek;\n"+
		"But at fourscore it is too late a week:\n"+
		"Yet fortune cannot recompense me better\n"+
		"Than to die well and not my master's debtor.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV. The Forest of Arden.\n"+
		"Enter ROSALIND for Ganymede, CELIA for Aliena, and TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"O Jupiter, how weary are my spirits!\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"I care not for my spirits, if my legs were not weary.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"I could find in my heart to disgrace my man's\n"+
		"apparel and to cry like a woman; but I must comfort\n"+
		"the weaker vessel, as doublet and hose ought to show\n"+
		"itself courageous to petticoat: therefore courage,\n"+
		"good Aliena!\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"I pray you, bear with me; I cannot go no further.\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"For my part, I had rather bear with you than bear\n"+
		"you; yet I should bear no cross if I did bear you,\n"+
		"for I think you have no money in your purse.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Well, this is the forest of Arden.\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"Ay, now am I in Arden; the more fool I; when I was\n"+
		"at home, I was in a better place: but travellers\n"+
		"must be content.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Ay, be so, good Touchstone.\n"+
		"Enter CORIN and SILVIUS\n"+
		"Look you, who comes here; a young man and an old in\n"+
		"solemn talk.\n"+
		"CORIN\n"+
		"That is the way to make her scorn you still.\n"+
		"SILVIUS\n"+
		"O Corin, that thou knew'st how I do love her!\n"+
		"CORIN\n"+
		"I partly guess; for I have loved ere now.\n"+
		"SILVIUS\n"+
		"No, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess,\n"+
		"Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover\n"+
		"As ever sigh'd upon a midnight pillow:\n"+
		"But if thy love were ever like to mine--\n"+
		"As sure I think did never man love so--\n"+
		"How many actions most ridiculous\n"+
		"Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?\n"+
		"CORIN\n"+
		"Into a thousand that I have forgotten.\n"+
		"SILVIUS\n"+
		"O, thou didst then ne'er love so heartily!\n"+
		"If thou remember'st not the slightest folly\n"+
		"That ever love did make thee run into,\n"+
		"Thou hast not loved:\n"+
		"Or if thou hast not sat as I do now,\n"+
		"Wearying thy hearer in thy mistress' praise,\n"+
		"Thou hast not loved:\n"+
		"Or if thou hast not broke from company\n"+
		"Abruptly, as my passion now makes me,\n"+
		"Thou hast not loved.\n"+
		"O Phebe, Phebe, Phebe!\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Alas, poor shepherd! searching of thy wound,\n"+
		"I have by hard adventure found mine own.\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"And I mine. I remember, when I was in love I broke\n"+
		"my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for\n"+
		"coming a-night to Jane Smile; and I remember the\n"+
		"kissing of her batlet and the cow's dugs that her\n"+
		"pretty chopt hands had milked; and I remember the\n"+
		"wooing of a peascod instead of her, from whom I took\n"+
		"two cods and, giving her them again, said with\n"+
		"weeping tears 'Wear these for my sake.' We that are\n"+
		"true lovers run into strange capers; but as all is\n"+
		"mortal in nature, so is all nature in love mortal in folly.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Thou speakest wiser than thou art ware of.\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"Nay, I shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till I\n"+
		"break my shins against it.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Jove, Jove! this shepherd's passion\n"+
		"Is much upon my fashion.\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"And mine; but it grows something stale with me.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"I pray you, one of you question yond man\n"+
		"If he for gold will give us any food:\n"+
		"I faint almost to death.\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"Holla, you clown!\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Peace, fool: he's not thy kinsman.\n"+
		"CORIN\n"+
		"Who calls?\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"Your betters, sir.\n"+
		"CORIN\n"+
		"Else are they very wretched.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Peace, I say. Good even to you, friend.\n"+
		"CORIN\n"+
		"And to you, gentle sir, and to you all.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"I prithee, shepherd, if that love or gold\n"+
		"Can in this desert place buy entertainment,\n"+
		"Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed:\n"+
		"Here's a young maid with travel much oppress'd\n"+
		"And faints for succor.\n"+
		"CORIN\n"+
		"Fair sir, I pity her\n"+
		"And wish, for her sake more than for mine own,\n"+
		"My fortunes were more able to relieve her;\n"+
		"But I am shepherd to another man\n"+
		"And do not shear the fleeces that I graze:\n"+
		"My master is of churlish disposition\n"+
		"And little recks to find the way to heaven\n"+
		"By doing deeds of hospitality:\n"+
		"Besides, his cote, his flocks and bounds of feed\n"+
		"Are now on sale, and at our sheepcote now,\n"+
		"By reason of his absence, there is nothing\n"+
		"That you will feed on; but what is, come see.\n"+
		"And in my voice most welcome shall you be.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?\n"+
		"CORIN\n"+
		"That young swain that you saw here but erewhile,\n"+
		"That little cares for buying any thing.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"I pray thee, if it stand with honesty,\n"+
		"Buy thou the cottage, pasture and the flock,\n"+
		"And thou shalt have to pay for it of us.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"And we will mend thy wages. I like this place.\n"+
		"And willingly could waste my time in it.\n"+
		"CORIN\n"+
		"Assuredly the thing is to be sold:\n"+
		"Go with me: if you like upon report\n"+
		"The soil, the profit and this kind of life,\n"+
		"I will your very faithful feeder be\n"+
		"And buy it with your gold right suddenly.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE V. The Forest.\n"+
		"Enter AMIENS, JAQUES, and others\n"+
		"SONG.\n"+
		"AMIENS\n"+
		"Under the greenwood tree\n"+
		"Who loves to lie with me,\n"+
		"And turn his merry note\n"+
		"Unto the sweet bird's throat,\n"+
		"Come hither, come hither, come hither:\n"+
		"Here shall he see No enemy\n"+
		"But winter and rough weather.\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"More, more, I prithee, more.\n"+
		"AMIENS\n"+
		"It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques.\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"I thank it. More, I prithee, more. I can suck\n"+
		"melancholy out of a song, as a weasel sucks eggs.\n"+
		"More, I prithee, more.\n"+
		"AMIENS\n"+
		"My voice is ragged: I know I cannot please you.\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"I do not desire you to please me; I do desire you to\n"+
		"sing. Come, more; another stanzo: call you 'em stanzos?\n"+
		"AMIENS\n"+
		"What you will, Monsieur Jaques.\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"Nay, I care not for their names; they owe me\n"+
		"nothing. Will you sing?\n"+
		"AMIENS\n"+
		"More at your request than to please myself.\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"Well then, if ever I thank any man, I'll thank you;\n"+
		"but that they call compliment is like the encounter\n"+
		"of two dog-apes, and when a man thanks me heartily,\n"+
		"methinks I have given him a penny and he renders me\n"+
		"the beggarly thanks. Come, sing; and you that will\n"+
		"not, hold your tongues.\n"+
		"AMIENS\n"+
		"Well, I'll end the song. Sirs, cover the while; the\n"+
		"duke will drink under this tree. He hath been all\n"+
		"this day to look you.\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"And I have been all this day to avoid him. He is\n"+
		"too disputable for my company: I think of as many\n"+
		"matters as he, but I give heaven thanks and make no\n"+
		"boast of them. Come, warble, come.\n"+
		"SONG.\n"+
		"Who doth ambition shun\n"+
		"All together here\n"+
		"And loves to live i' the sun,\n"+
		"Seeking the food he eats\n"+
		"And pleased with what he gets,\n"+
		"Come hither, come hither, come hither:\n"+
		"Here shall he see No enemy\n"+
		"But winter and rough weather.\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"I'll give you a verse to this note that I made\n"+
		"yesterday in despite of my invention.\n"+
		"AMIENS\n"+
		"And I'll sing it.\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"Thus it goes:--\n"+
		"If it do come to pass\n"+
		"That any man turn ass,\n"+
		"Leaving his wealth and ease,\n"+
		"A stubborn will to please,\n"+
		"Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame:\n"+
		"Here shall he see\n"+
		"Gross fools as he,\n"+
		"An if he will come to me.\n"+
		"AMIENS\n"+
		"What's that 'ducdame'?\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"'Tis a Greek invocation, to call fools into a\n"+
		"circle. I'll go sleep, if I can; if I cannot, I'll\n"+
		"rail against all the first-born of Egypt.\n"+
		"AMIENS\n"+
		"And I'll go seek the duke: his banquet is prepared.\n"+
		"Exeunt severally\n"+
		"SCENE VI. The forest.\n"+
		"Enter ORLANDO and ADAM\n"+
		"ADAM\n"+
		"Dear master, I can go no further. O, I die for food!\n"+
		"Here lie I down, and measure out my grave. Farewell,\n"+
		"kind master.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Why, how now, Adam! no greater heart in thee? Live\n"+
		"a little; comfort a little; cheer thyself a little.\n"+
		"If this uncouth forest yield any thing savage, I\n"+
		"will either be food for it or bring it for food to\n"+
		"thee. Thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers.\n"+
		"For my sake be comfortable; hold death awhile at\n"+
		"the arm's end: I will here be with thee presently;\n"+
		"and if I bring thee not something to eat, I will\n"+
		"give thee leave to die: but if thou diest before I\n"+
		"come, thou art a mocker of my labour. Well said!\n"+
		"thou lookest cheerly, and I'll be with thee quickly.\n"+
		"Yet thou liest in the bleak air: come, I will bear\n"+
		"thee to some shelter; and thou shalt not die for\n"+
		"lack of a dinner, if there live any thing in this\n"+
		"desert. Cheerly, good Adam!\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE VII. The forest.\n"+
		"A table set out. Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and Lords like outlaws\n"+
		"DUKE SENIOR\n"+
		"I think he be transform'd into a beast;\n"+
		"For I can no where find him like a man.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"My lord, he is but even now gone hence:\n"+
		"Here was he merry, hearing of a song.\n"+
		"DUKE SENIOR\n"+
		"If he, compact of jars, grow musical,\n"+
		"We shall have shortly discord in the spheres.\n"+
		"Go, seek him: tell him I would speak with him.\n"+
		"Enter JAQUES\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"He saves my labour by his own approach.\n"+
		"DUKE SENIOR\n"+
		"Why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this,\n"+
		"That your poor friends must woo your company?\n"+
		"What, you look merrily!\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"A fool, a fool! I met a fool i' the forest,\n"+
		"A motley fool; a miserable world!\n"+
		"As I do live by food, I met a fool\n"+
		"Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun,\n"+
		"And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms,\n"+
		"In good set terms and yet a motley fool.\n"+
		"'Good morrow, fool,' quoth I. 'No, sir,' quoth he,\n"+
		"'Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune:'\n"+
		"And then he drew a dial from his poke,\n"+
		"And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,\n"+
		"Says very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock:\n"+
		"Thus we may see,' quoth he, 'how the world wags:\n"+
		"'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,\n"+
		"And after one hour more 'twill be eleven;\n"+
		"And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,\n"+
		"And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot;\n"+
		"And thereby hangs a tale.' When I did hear\n"+
		"The motley fool thus moral on the time,\n"+
		"My lungs began to crow like chanticleer,\n"+
		"That fools should be so deep-contemplative,\n"+
		"And I did laugh sans intermission\n"+
		"An hour by his dial. O noble fool!\n"+
		"A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.\n"+
		"DUKE SENIOR\n"+
		"What fool is this?\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,\n"+
		"And says, if ladies be but young and fair,\n"+
		"They have the gift to know it: and in his brain,\n"+
		"Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit\n"+
		"After a voyage, he hath strange places cramm'd\n"+
		"With observation, the which he vents\n"+
		"In mangled forms. O that I were a fool!\n"+
		"I am ambitious for a motley coat.\n"+
		"DUKE SENIOR\n"+
		"Thou shalt have one.\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"It is my only suit;\n"+
		"Provided that you weed your better judgments\n"+
		"Of all opinion that grows rank in them\n"+
		"That I am wise. I must have liberty\n"+
		"Withal, as large a charter as the wind,\n"+
		"To blow on whom I please; for so fools have;\n"+
		"And they that are most galled with my folly,\n"+
		"They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?\n"+
		"The 'why' is plain as way to parish church:\n"+
		"He that a fool doth very wisely hit\n"+
		"Doth very foolishly, although he smart,\n"+
		"Not to seem senseless of the bob: if not,\n"+
		"The wise man's folly is anatomized\n"+
		"Even by the squandering glances of the fool.\n"+
		"Invest me in my motley; give me leave\n"+
		"To speak my mind, and I will through and through\n"+
		"Cleanse the foul body of the infected world,\n"+
		"If they will patiently receive my medicine.\n"+
		"DUKE SENIOR\n"+
		"Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"What, for a counter, would I do but good?\n"+
		"DUKE SENIOR\n"+
		"Most mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin:\n"+
		"For thou thyself hast been a libertine,\n"+
		"As sensual as the brutish sting itself;\n"+
		"And all the embossed sores and headed evils,\n"+
		"That thou with licence of free foot hast caught,\n"+
		"Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"Why, who cries out on pride,\n"+
		"That can therein tax any private party?\n"+
		"Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea,\n"+
		"Till that the weary very means do ebb?\n"+
		"What woman in the city do I name,\n"+
		"When that I say the city-woman bears\n"+
		"The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?\n"+
		"Who can come in and say that I mean her,\n"+
		"When such a one as she such is her neighbour?\n"+
		"Or what is he of basest function\n"+
		"That says his bravery is not of my cost,\n"+
		"Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits\n"+
		"His folly to the mettle of my speech?\n"+
		"There then; how then? what then? Let me see wherein\n"+
		"My tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right,\n"+
		"Then he hath wrong'd himself; if he be free,\n"+
		"Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies,\n"+
		"Unclaim'd of any man. But who comes here?\n"+
		"Enter ORLANDO, with his sword drawn\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Forbear, and eat no more.\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"Why, I have eat none yet.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Nor shalt not, till necessity be served.\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"Of what kind should this cock come of?\n"+
		"DUKE SENIOR\n"+
		"Art thou thus bolden'd, man, by thy distress,\n"+
		"Or else a rude despiser of good manners,\n"+
		"That in civility thou seem'st so empty?\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"You touch'd my vein at first: the thorny point\n"+
		"Of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show\n"+
		"Of smooth civility: yet am I inland bred\n"+
		"And know some nurture. But forbear, I say:\n"+
		"He dies that touches any of this fruit\n"+
		"Till I and my affairs are answered.\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"An you will not be answered with reason, I must die.\n"+
		"DUKE SENIOR\n"+
		"What would you have? Your gentleness shall force\n"+
		"More than your force move us to gentleness.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"I almost die for food; and let me have it.\n"+
		"DUKE SENIOR\n"+
		"Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you:\n"+
		"I thought that all things had been savage here;\n"+
		"And therefore put I on the countenance\n"+
		"Of stern commandment. But whate'er you are\n"+
		"That in this desert inaccessible,\n"+
		"Under the shade of melancholy boughs,\n"+
		"Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time\n"+
		"If ever you have look'd on better days,\n"+
		"If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church,\n"+
		"If ever sat at any good man's feast,\n"+
		"If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear\n"+
		"And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied,\n"+
		"Let gentleness my strong enforcement be:\n"+
		"In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.\n"+
		"DUKE SENIOR\n"+
		"True is it that we have seen better days,\n"+
		"And have with holy bell been knoll'd to church\n"+
		"And sat at good men's feasts and wiped our eyes\n"+
		"Of drops that sacred pity hath engender'd:\n"+
		"And therefore sit you down in gentleness\n"+
		"And take upon command what help we have\n"+
		"That to your wanting may be minister'd.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Then but forbear your food a little while,\n"+
		"Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn\n"+
		"And give it food. There is an old poor man,\n"+
		"Who after me hath many a weary step\n"+
		"Limp'd in pure love: till he be first sufficed,\n"+
		"Oppress'd with two weak evils, age and hunger,\n"+
		"I will not touch a bit.\n"+
		"DUKE SENIOR\n"+
		"Go find him out,\n"+
		"And we will nothing waste till you return.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"I thank ye; and be blest for your good comfort!\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"DUKE SENIOR\n"+
		"Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy:\n"+
		"This wide and universal theatre\n"+
		"Presents more woeful pageants than the scene\n"+
		"Wherein we play in.\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"All the world's a stage,\n"+
		"And all the men and women merely players:\n"+
		"They have their exits and their entrances;\n"+
		"And one man in his time plays many parts,\n"+
		"His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,\n"+
		"Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.\n"+
		"And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel\n"+
		"And shining morning face, creeping like snail\n"+
		"Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,\n"+
		"Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad\n"+
		"Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,\n"+
		"Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,\n"+
		"Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,\n"+
		"Seeking the bubble reputation\n"+
		"Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,\n"+
		"In fair round belly with good capon lined,\n"+
		"With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,\n"+
		"Full of wise saws and modern instances;\n"+
		"And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts\n"+
		"Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,\n"+
		"With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,\n"+
		"His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide\n"+
		"For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,\n"+
		"Turning again toward childish treble, pipes\n"+
		"And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,\n"+
		"That ends this strange eventful history,\n"+
		"Is second childishness and mere oblivion,\n"+
		"Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.\n"+
		"Re-enter ORLANDO, with ADAM\n"+
		"DUKE SENIOR\n"+
		"Welcome. Set down your venerable burthen,\n"+
		"And let him feed.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"I thank you most for him.\n"+
		"ADAM\n"+
		"So had you need:\n"+
		"I scarce can speak to thank you for myself.\n"+
		"DUKE SENIOR\n"+
		"Welcome; fall to: I will not trouble you\n"+
		"As yet, to question you about your fortunes.\n"+
		"Give us some music; and, good cousin, sing.\n"+
		"SONG.\n"+
		"AMIENS\n"+
		"Blow, blow, thou winter wind.\n"+
		"Thou art not so unkind\n"+
		"As man's ingratitude;\n"+
		"Thy tooth is not so keen,\n"+
		"Because thou art not seen,\n"+
		"Although thy breath be rude.\n"+
		"Heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! unto the green holly:\n"+
		"Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly:\n"+
		"Then, heigh-ho, the holly!\n"+
		"This life is most jolly.\n"+
		"Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,\n"+
		"That dost not bite so nigh\n"+
		"As benefits forgot:\n"+
		"Though thou the waters warp,\n"+
		"Thy sting is not so sharp\n"+
		"As friend remember'd not.\n"+
		"Heigh-ho! sing, & c.\n"+
		"DUKE SENIOR\n"+
		"If that you were the good Sir Rowland's son,\n"+
		"As you have whisper'd faithfully you were,\n"+
		"And as mine eye doth his effigies witness\n"+
		"Most truly limn'd and living in your face,\n"+
		"Be truly welcome hither: I am the duke\n"+
		"That loved your father: the residue of your fortune,\n"+
		"Go to my cave and tell me. Good old man,\n"+
		"Thou art right welcome as thy master is.\n"+
		"Support him by the arm. Give me your hand,\n"+
		"And let me all your fortunes understand.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT III\n"+
		"SCENE I. A room in the palace.\n"+
		"Enter DUKE FREDERICK, Lords, and OLIVER\n"+
		"DUKE FREDERICK\n"+
		"Not see him since? Sir, sir, that cannot be:\n"+
		"But were I not the better part made mercy,\n"+
		"I should not seek an absent argument\n"+
		"Of my revenge, thou present. But look to it:\n"+
		"Find out thy brother, wheresoe'er he is;\n"+
		"Seek him with candle; bring him dead or living\n"+
		"Within this twelvemonth, or turn thou no more\n"+
		"To seek a living in our territory.\n"+
		"Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine\n"+
		"Worth seizure do we seize into our hands,\n"+
		"Till thou canst quit thee by thy brothers mouth\n"+
		"Of what we think against thee.\n"+
		"OLIVER\n"+
		"O that your highness knew my heart in this!\n"+
		"I never loved my brother in my life.\n"+
		"DUKE FREDERICK\n"+
		"More villain thou. Well, push him out of doors;\n"+
		"And let my officers of such a nature\n"+
		"Make an extent upon his house and lands:\n"+
		"Do this expediently and turn him going.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. The forest.\n"+
		"Enter ORLANDO, with a paper\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Hang there, my verse, in witness of my love:\n"+
		"And thou, thrice-crowned queen of night, survey\n"+
		"With thy chaste eye, from thy pale sphere above,\n"+
		"Thy huntress' name that my full life doth sway.\n"+
		"O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books\n"+
		"And in their barks my thoughts I'll character;\n"+
		"That every eye which in this forest looks\n"+
		"Shall see thy virtue witness'd every where.\n"+
		"Run, run, Orlando; carve on every tree\n"+
		"The fair, the chaste and unexpressive she.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"Enter CORIN and TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"CORIN\n"+
		"And how like you this shepherd's life, Master Touchstone?\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good\n"+
		"life, but in respect that it is a shepherd's life,\n"+
		"it is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I\n"+
		"like it very well; but in respect that it is\n"+
		"private, it is a very vile life. Now, in respect it\n"+
		"is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in\n"+
		"respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As\n"+
		"is it a spare life, look you, it fits my humour well;\n"+
		"but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much\n"+
		"against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?\n"+
		"CORIN\n"+
		"No more but that I know the more one sickens the\n"+
		"worse at ease he is; and that he that wants money,\n"+
		"means and content is without three good friends;\n"+
		"that the property of rain is to wet and fire to\n"+
		"burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep, and that a\n"+
		"great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that\n"+
		"he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may\n"+
		"complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred.\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in\n"+
		"court, shepherd?\n"+
		"CORIN\n"+
		"No, truly.\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"Then thou art damned.\n"+
		"CORIN\n"+
		"Nay, I hope.\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"Truly, thou art damned like an ill-roasted egg, all\n"+
		"on one side.\n"+
		"CORIN\n"+
		"For not being at court? Your reason.\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never sawest\n"+
		"good manners; if thou never sawest good manners,\n"+
		"then thy manners must be wicked; and wickedness is\n"+
		"sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous\n"+
		"state, shepherd.\n"+
		"CORIN\n"+
		"Not a whit, Touchstone: those that are good manners\n"+
		"at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the\n"+
		"behavior of the country is most mockable at the\n"+
		"court. You told me you salute not at the court, but\n"+
		"you kiss your hands: that courtesy would be\n"+
		"uncleanly, if courtiers were shepherds.\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"Instance, briefly; come, instance.\n"+
		"CORIN\n"+
		"Why, we are still handling our ewes, and their\n"+
		"fells, you know, are greasy.\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"Why, do not your courtier's hands sweat? and is not\n"+
		"the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of\n"+
		"a man? Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say; come.\n"+
		"CORIN\n"+
		"Besides, our hands are hard.\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again.\n"+
		"A more sounder instance, come.\n"+
		"CORIN\n"+
		"And they are often tarred over with the surgery of\n"+
		"our sheep: and would you have us kiss tar? The\n"+
		"courtier's hands are perfumed with civet.\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"Most shallow man! thou worms-meat, in respect of a\n"+
		"good piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, and\n"+
		"perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar, the\n"+
		"very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd.\n"+
		"CORIN\n"+
		"You have too courtly a wit for me: I'll rest.\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"Wilt thou rest damned? God help thee, shallow man!\n"+
		"God make incision in thee! thou art raw.\n"+
		"CORIN\n"+
		"Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get\n"+
		"that I wear, owe no man hate, envy no man's\n"+
		"happiness, glad of other men's good, content with my\n"+
		"harm, and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes\n"+
		"graze and my lambs suck.\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"That is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes\n"+
		"and the rams together and to offer to get your\n"+
		"living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a\n"+
		"bell-wether, and to betray a she-lamb of a\n"+
		"twelvemonth to a crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram,\n"+
		"out of all reasonable match. If thou beest not\n"+
		"damned for this, the devil himself will have no\n"+
		"shepherds; I cannot see else how thou shouldst\n"+
		"'scape.\n"+
		"CORIN\n"+
		"Here comes young Master Ganymede, my new mistress's brother.\n"+
		"Enter ROSALIND, with a paper, reading\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"From the east to western Ind,\n"+
		"No jewel is like Rosalind.\n"+
		"Her worth, being mounted on the wind,\n"+
		"Through all the world bears Rosalind.\n"+
		"All the pictures fairest lined\n"+
		"Are but black to Rosalind.\n"+
		"Let no fair be kept in mind\n"+
		"But the fair of Rosalind.\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"I'll rhyme you so eight years together, dinners and\n"+
		"suppers and sleeping-hours excepted: it is the\n"+
		"right butter-women's rank to market.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Out, fool!\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+

		"Didst thou hear these verses?\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"O, yes, I heard them all, and more too; for some of\n"+
		"them had in them more feet than the verses would bear.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"That's no matter: the feet might bear the verses.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Ay, but the feet were lame and could not bear\n"+

		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder\n"+
		"before you came; for look here what I found on a\n"+

		"quickly, and speak apace. I would thou couldst\n"+
		"stammer, that thou mightst pour this concealed man\n"+
		"out of thy mouth, as wine comes out of a narrow-\n"+

		"How parted he with thee? and when shalt thou see\n"+
		"him again? Answer me in one word.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"You must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first: 'tis a\n"+

		"Give me audience, good madam.\n"+

		"Proceed.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"There lay he, stretched along, like a wounded knight.\n"+

		"CELIA\n"+
		"Cry 'holla' to thy tongue, I prithee; it curvets\n"+

		"O, ominous! he comes to kill my heart.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"I would sing my song without a burden: thou bringest\n"+
		"me out of tune.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Do you not know I am a woman? when I think, I must\n"+
		"speak. Sweet, say on.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"You bring me out. Soft! comes he not here?\n"+
		"Enter ORLANDO and JAQUES\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"'Tis he: slink by, and note him.\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"I thank you for your company; but, good faith, I had\n"+
		"as lief have been myself alone.\n"+

		"And so had I; but yet, for fashion sake, I thank you\n"+
		"too for your society.\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"God be wi' you: let's meet as little as we can.\n"+

		"JAQUES\n"+
		"Rosalind is your love's name?\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Yes, just.\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"I do not like her name.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"There was no thought of pleasing you when she was\n"+
		"christened.\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"What stature is she of?\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Just as high as my heart.\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"You are full of pretty answers. Have you not been\n"+
		"acquainted with goldsmiths' wives, and conned them\n"+
		"out of rings?\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Not so; but I answer you right painted cloth, from\n"+
		"whence you have studied your questions.\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"You have a nimble wit: I think 'twas made of\n"+
		"Atalanta's heels. Will you sit down with me? and\n"+
		"we two will rail against our mistress the world and\n"+
		"all our misery.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"I will chide no breather in the world but myself,\n"+
		"against whom I know most faults.\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"The worst fault you have is to be in love.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"'Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue.\n"+
		"I am weary of you.\n"+

		"By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I found\n"+

		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"He is drowned in the brook: look but in, and you\n"+
		"shall see him.\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"There I shall see mine own figure.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"I'll tarry no longer with you: farewell, good\n"+
		"Signior Love.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"I am glad of your departure: adieu, good Monsieur\n"+
		"Melancholy.\n"+
		"Exit JAQUES\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"[Aside to CELIA] I will speak to him, like a saucy\n"+
		"lackey and under that habit play the knave with him.\n"+
		"Do you hear, forester?\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Very well: what would you?\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"I pray you, what is't o'clock?\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"You should ask me what time o' day: there's no clock\n"+
		"in the forest.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Then there is no true lover in the forest; else\n"+
		"sighing every minute and groaning every hour would\n"+
		"detect the lazy foot of Time as well as a clock.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"And why not the swift foot of Time? had not that\n"+
		"been as proper?\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"By no means, sir: Time travels in divers paces with\n"+
		"divers persons. I'll tell you who Time ambles\n"+
		"withal, who Time trots withal, who Time gallops\n"+
		"withal and who he stands still withal.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"I prithee, who doth he trot withal?\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the\n"+
		"contract of her marriage and the day it is\n"+
		"solemnized: if the interim be but a se'nnight,\n"+
		"Time's pace is so hard that it seems the length of\n"+
		"seven year.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Who ambles Time withal?\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that\n"+
		"hath not the gout, for the one sleeps easily because\n"+
		"he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because\n"+
		"he feels no pain, the one lacking the burden of lean\n"+
		"and wasteful learning, the other knowing no burden\n"+
		"of heavy tedious penury; these Time ambles withal.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Who doth he gallop withal?\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"With a thief to the gallows, for though he go as\n"+
		"softly as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Who stays it still withal?\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"With lawyers in the vacation, for they sleep between\n"+
		"term and term and then they perceive not how Time moves.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Where dwell you, pretty youth?\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"With this shepherdess, my sister; here in the\n"+
		"skirts of the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Are you native of this place?\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"As the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Your accent is something finer than you could\n"+
		"purchase in so removed a dwelling.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"I have been told so of many: but indeed an old\n"+
		"religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was\n"+
		"in his youth an inland man; one that knew courtship\n"+
		"too well, for there he fell in love. I have heard\n"+
		"him read many lectures against it, and I thank God\n"+
		"I am not a woman, to be touched with so many\n"+
		"giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their\n"+
		"whole sex withal.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Can you remember any of the principal evils that he\n"+
		"laid to the charge of women?\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"There were none principal; they were all like one\n"+
		"another as half-pence are, every one fault seeming\n"+
		"monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"I prithee, recount some of them.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"No, I will not cast away my physic but on those that\n"+
		"are sick. There is a man haunts the forest, that\n"+
		"abuses our young plants with carving 'Rosalind' on\n"+
		"their barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies\n"+
		"on brambles, all, forsooth, deifying the name of\n"+
		"Rosalind: if I could meet that fancy-monger I would\n"+
		"give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the\n"+
		"quotidian of love upon him.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"I am he that is so love-shaked: I pray you tell me\n"+
		"your remedy.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"There is none of my uncle's marks upon you: he\n"+
		"taught me how to know a man in love; in which cage\n"+
		"of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"What were his marks?\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"A lean cheek, which you have not, a blue eye and\n"+
		"sunken, which you have not, an unquestionable\n"+
		"spirit, which you have not, a beard neglected,\n"+
		"which you have not; but I pardon you for that, for\n"+
		"simply your having in beard is a younger brother's\n"+
		"revenue: then your hose should be ungartered, your\n"+
		"bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe\n"+
		"untied and every thing about you demonstrating a\n"+
		"careless desolation; but you are no such man; you\n"+
		"are rather point-device in your accoutrements as\n"+
		"loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Me believe it! you may as soon make her that you\n"+
		"love believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter to\n"+
		"do than to confess she does: that is one of the\n"+
		"points in the which women still give the lie to\n"+
		"their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he\n"+
		"that hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind\n"+
		"is so admired?\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of\n"+
		"Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Love is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves\n"+
		"as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do: and\n"+
		"the reason why they are not so punished and cured\n"+
		"is, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers\n"+
		"are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Did you ever cure any so?\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me\n"+
		"his love, his mistress; and I set him every day to\n"+
		"woo me: at which time would I, being but a moonish\n"+
		"youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing\n"+
		"and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow,\n"+
		"inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for every\n"+
		"passion something and for no passion truly any\n"+
		"thing, as boys and women are for the most part\n"+
		"cattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe\n"+
		"him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep\n"+
		"for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor\n"+
		"from his mad humour of love to a living humour of\n"+
		"madness; which was, to forswear the full stream of\n"+
		"the world, and to live in a nook merely monastic.\n"+
		"And thus I cured him; and this way will I take upon\n"+
		"me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's\n"+
		"heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in't.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"I would not be cured, youth.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind\n"+
		"and come every day to my cote and woo me.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Now, by the faith of my love, I will: tell me\n"+
		"where it is.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Go with me to it and I'll show it you and by the way\n"+
		"you shall tell me where in the forest you live.\n"+
		"Will you go?\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"With all my heart, good youth.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Nay you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you go?\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. The forest.\n"+
		"Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY; JAQUES behind\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"Come apace, good Audrey: I will fetch up your\n"+
		"goats, Audrey. And how, Audrey? am I the man yet?\n"+
		"doth my simple feature content you?\n"+
		"AUDREY\n"+
		"Your features! Lord warrant us! what features!\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most\n"+
		"capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths.\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"[Aside] O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jove\n"+
		"in a thatched house!\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"When a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a\n"+
		"man's good wit seconded with the forward child\n"+
		"Understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a\n"+
		"great reckoning in a little room. Truly, I would\n"+
		"the gods had made thee poetical.\n"+
		"AUDREY\n"+
		"I do not know what 'poetical' is: is it honest in\n"+
		"deed and word? is it a true thing?\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most\n"+
		"feigning; and lovers are given to poetry, and what\n"+
		"they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign.\n"+
		"AUDREY\n"+
		"Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical?\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"I do, truly; for thou swearest to me thou art\n"+
		"honest: now, if thou wert a poet, I might have some\n"+
		"hope thou didst feign.\n"+
		"AUDREY\n"+
		"Would you not have me honest?\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favoured; for\n"+
		"honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"[Aside] A material fool!\n"+
		"AUDREY\n"+
		"Well, I am not fair; and therefore I pray the gods\n"+
		"make me honest.\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut\n"+
		"were to put good meat into an unclean dish.\n"+
		"AUDREY\n"+
		"I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness!\n"+
		"sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may\n"+
		"be, I will marry thee, and to that end I have been\n"+
		"with Sir Oliver Martext, the vicar of the next\n"+
		"village, who hath promised to meet me in this place\n"+
		"of the forest and to couple us.\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"[Aside] I would fain see this meeting.\n"+
		"AUDREY\n"+
		"Well, the gods give us joy!\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart,\n"+
		"stagger in this attempt; for here we have no temple\n"+
		"but the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts. But what\n"+
		"though? C ourage! As horns are odious, they are\n"+
		"necessary. It is said, 'many a man knows no end of\n"+
		"his goods:' right; many a man has good horns, and\n"+
		"knows no end of them. Well, that is the dowry of\n"+
		"his wife; 'tis none of his own getting. Horns?\n"+
		"Even so. Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest deer\n"+
		"hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man\n"+
		"therefore blessed? No: as a walled town is more\n"+
		"worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a\n"+
		"married man more honourable than the bare brow of a\n"+
		"bachelor; and by how much defence is better than no\n"+
		"skill, by so much is a horn more precious than to\n"+
		"want. Here comes Sir Oliver.\n"+
		"Enter SIR OLIVER MARTEXT\n"+
		"Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met: will you\n"+
		"dispatch us here under this tree, or shall we go\n"+
		"with you to your chapel?\n"+
		"SIR OLIVER MARTEXT\n"+
		"Is there none here to give the woman?\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"I will not take her on gift of any man.\n"+
		"SIR OLIVER MARTEXT\n"+
		"Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful.\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"[Advancing]\n"+
		"Proceed, proceed I'll give her.\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"Good even, good Master What-ye-call't: how do you,\n"+
		"sir? You are very well met: God 'ild you for your\n"+

		"As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb and\n"+
		"the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires; and\n"+
		"as pigeons bill, so wedlock would be nibbling.\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"And will you, being a man of your breeding, be\n"+
		"married under a bush like a beggar? Get you to\n"+
		"church, and have a good priest that can tell you\n"+
		"what marriage is: this fellow will but join you\n"+
		"together as they join wainscot; then one of you will\n"+
		"prove a shrunk panel and, like green timber, warp, warp.\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"[Aside] I am not in the mind but I were better to be\n"+

		"JAQUES\n"+
		"Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.\n"+

		"'Come, sweet Audrey:\n"+

		"I will not to wedding with thee.\n"+
		"Exeunt JAQUES, TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY\n"+
		"SIR OLIVER MARTEXT\n"+
		"'Tis no matter: ne'er a fantastical knave of them\n"+
		"all shall flout me out of my calling.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE IV. The forest.\n"+
		"Enter ROSALIND and CELIA\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Never talk to me; I will weep.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"Do, I prithee; but yet have the grace to consider\n"+
		"that tears do not become a man.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"But have I not cause to weep?\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"As good cause as one would desire; therefore weep.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"His very hair is of the dissembling colour.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"Something browner than Judas's marry, his kisses are\n"+
		"Judas's own children.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"I' faith, his hair is of a good colour.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch\n"+
		"of holy bread.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana: a nun\n"+
		"of winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously;\n"+
		"the very ice of chastity is in them.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"But why did he swear he would come this morning, and\n"+
		"comes not?\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Do you think so?\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"Yes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor a\n"+
		"horse-stealer, but for his verity in love, I do\n"+
		"think him as concave as a covered goblet or a\n"+
		"worm-eaten nut.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Not true in love?\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"Yes, when he is in; but I think he is not in.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"You have heard him swear downright he was.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"'Was' is not 'is:' besides, the oath of a lover is\n"+
		"no stronger than the word of a tapster; they are\n"+
		"both the confirmer of false reckonings. He attends\n"+
		"here in the forest on the duke your father.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"I met the duke yesterday and had much question with\n"+
		"him: he asked me of what parentage I was; I told\n"+
		"him, of as good as he; so he laughed and let me go.\n"+
		"But what talk we of fathers, when there is such a\n"+
		"man as Orlando?\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"O, that's a brave man! he writes brave verses,\n"+
		"speaks brave words, swears brave oaths and breaks\n"+
		"them bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of\n"+
		"his lover; as a puisny tilter, that spurs his horse\n"+
		"but on one side, breaks his staff like a noble\n"+
		"goose: but all's brave that youth mounts and folly\n"+
		"guides. Who comes here?\n"+
		"Enter CORIN\n"+
		"CORIN\n"+
		"Mistress and master, you have oft inquired\n"+
		"After the shepherd that complain'd of love,\n"+
		"Who you saw sitting by me on the turf,\n"+
		"Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess\n"+
		"That was his mistress.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"Well, and what of him?\n"+
		"CORIN\n"+
		"If you will see a pageant truly play'd,\n"+
		"Between the pale complexion of true love\n"+
		"And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,\n"+
		"Go hence a little and I shall conduct you,\n"+
		"If you will mark it.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"O, come, let us remove:\n"+
		"The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.\n"+
		"Bring us to this sight, and you shall say\n"+
		"I'll prove a busy actor in their play.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE V. Another part of the forest.\n"+
		"Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE\n"+
		"SILVIUS\n"+
		"Sweet Phebe, do not scorn me; do not, Phebe;\n"+
		"Say that you love me not, but say not so\n"+
		"In bitterness. The common executioner,\n"+
		"Whose heart the accustom'd sight of death makes hard,\n"+
		"Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck\n"+
		"But first begs pardon: will you sterner be\n"+
		"Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?\n"+
		"Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN, behind\n"+
		"PHEBE\n"+
		"I would not be thy executioner:\n"+
		"I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.\n"+
		"Thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye:\n"+
		"'Tis pretty, sure, and very probable,\n"+
		"That eyes, that are the frail'st and softest things,\n"+
		"Who shut their coward gates on atomies,\n"+
		"Should be call'd tyrants, butchers, murderers!\n"+
		"Now I do frown on thee with all my heart;\n"+
		"And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee:\n"+
		"Now counterfeit to swoon; why now fall down;\n"+
		"Or if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,\n"+
		"Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers!\n"+
		"Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee:\n"+
		"Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains\n"+
		"Some scar of it; lean but upon a rush,\n"+
		"The cicatrice and capable impressure\n"+
		"Thy palm some moment keeps; but now mine eyes,\n"+
		"Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not,\n"+
		"Nor, I am sure, there is no force in eyes\n"+
		"That can do hurt.\n"+
		"SILVIUS\n"+
		"O dear Phebe,\n"+
		"If ever,--as that ever may be near,--\n"+
		"You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,\n"+
		"Then shall you know the wounds invisible\n"+
		"That love's keen arrows make.\n"+
		"PHEBE\n"+
		"But till that time\n"+
		"Come not thou near me: and when that time comes,\n"+
		"Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not;\n"+
		"As till that time I shall not pity thee.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"And why, I pray you? Who might be your mother,\n"+
		"That you insult, exult, and all at once,\n"+
		"Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty,--\n"+
		"As, by my faith, I see no more in you\n"+
		"Than without candle may go dark to bed--\n"+
		"Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?\n"+
		"Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?\n"+
		"I see no more in you than in the ordinary\n"+
		"Of nature's sale-work. 'Od's my little life,\n"+
		"I think she means to tangle my eyes too!\n"+
		"No, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it:\n"+
		"'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,\n"+
		"Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,\n"+
		"That can entame my spirits to your worship.\n"+
		"You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,\n"+
		"Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain?\n"+
		"You are a thousand times a properer man\n"+
		"Than she a woman: 'tis such fools as you\n"+
		"That makes the world full of ill-favour'd children:\n"+
		"'Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her;\n"+
		"And out of you she sees herself more proper\n"+
		"Than any of her lineaments can show her.\n"+
		"But, mistress, know yourself: down on your knees,\n"+
		"And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love:\n"+
		"For I must tell you friendly in your ear,\n"+
		"Sell when you can: you are not for all markets:\n"+
		"Cry the man mercy; love him; take his offer:\n"+
		"Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.\n"+
		"So take her to thee, shepherd: fare you well.\n"+
		"PHEBE\n"+
		"Sweet youth, I pray you, chide a year together:\n"+
		"I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"He's fallen in love with your foulness and she'll\n"+
		"fall in love with my anger. If it be so, as fast as\n"+
		"she answers thee with frowning looks, I'll sauce her\n"+
		"with bitter words. Why look you so upon me?\n"+
		"PHEBE\n"+
		"For no ill will I bear you.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"I pray you, do not fall in love with me,\n"+
		"For I am falser than vows made in wine:\n"+
		"Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house,\n"+
		"'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.\n"+
		"Will you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard.\n"+
		"Come, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better,\n"+
		"And be not proud: though all the world could see,\n"+
		"None could be so abused in sight as he.\n"+
		"Come, to our flock.\n"+
		"Exeunt ROSALIND, CELIA and CORIN\n"+
		"PHEBE\n"+
		"Dead Shepherd, now I find thy saw of might,\n"+
		"'Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?'\n"+
		"SILVIUS\n"+
		"Sweet Phebe,--\n"+
		"PHEBE\n"+
		"Ha, what say'st thou, Silvius?\n"+
		"SILVIUS\n"+
		"Sweet Phebe, pity me.\n"+
		"PHEBE\n"+
		"Why, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.\n"+
		"SILVIUS\n"+
		"Wherever sorrow is, relief would be:\n"+
		"If you do sorrow at my grief in love,\n"+
		"By giving love your sorrow and my grief\n"+
		"Were both extermined.\n"+
		"PHEBE\n"+
		"Thou hast my love: is not that neighbourly?\n"+
		"SILVIUS\n"+
		"I would have you.\n"+
		"PHEBE\n"+
		"Why, that were covetousness.\n"+
		"Silvius, the time was that I hated thee,\n"+
		"And yet it is not that I bear thee love;\n"+
		"But since that thou canst talk of love so well,\n"+
		"Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,\n"+
		"I will endure, and I'll employ thee too:\n"+
		"But do not look for further recompense\n"+
		"Than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd.\n"+
		"SILVIUS\n"+
		"So holy and so perfect is my love,\n"+
		"And I in such a poverty of grace,\n"+
		"That I shall think it a most plenteous crop\n"+
		"To glean the broken ears after the man\n"+
		"That the main harvest reaps: loose now and then\n"+
		"A scatter'd smile, and that I'll live upon.\n"+
		"PHEBE\n"+
		"Know'st now the youth that spoke to me erewhile?\n"+
		"SILVIUS\n"+
		"Not very well, but I have met him oft;\n"+
		"And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds\n"+
		"That the old carlot once was master of.\n"+
		"PHEBE\n"+
		"Think not I love him, though I ask for him:\n"+
		"'Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well;\n"+
		"But what care I for words? yet words do well\n"+
		"When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.\n"+
		"It is a pretty youth: not very pretty:\n"+
		"But, sure, he's proud, and yet his pride becomes him:\n"+
		"He'll make a proper man: the best thing in him\n"+
		"Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue\n"+
		"Did make offence his eye did heal it up.\n"+
		"He is not very tall; yet for his years he's tall:\n"+
		"His leg is but so so; and yet 'tis well:\n"+
		"There was a pretty redness in his lip,\n"+
		"A little riper and more lusty red\n"+
		"Than that mix'd in his cheek; 'twas just the difference\n"+
		"Between the constant red and mingled damask.\n"+
		"There be some women, Silvius, had they mark'd him\n"+
		"In parcels as I did, would have gone near\n"+
		"To fall in love with him; but, for my part,\n"+
		"I love him not nor hate him not; and yet\n"+
		"I have more cause to hate him than to love him:\n"+
		"For what had he to do to chide at me?\n"+
		"He said mine eyes were black and my hair black:\n"+
		"And, now I am remember'd, scorn'd at me:\n"+
		"I marvel why I answer'd not again:\n"+
		"But that's all one; omittance is no quittance.\n"+
		"I'll write to him a very taunting letter,\n"+
		"And thou shalt bear it: wilt thou, Silvius?\n"+
		"SILVIUS\n"+
		"Phebe, with all my heart.\n"+
		"PHEBE\n"+
		"I'll write it straight;\n"+
		"The matter's in my head and in my heart:\n"+
		"I will be bitter with him and passing short.\n"+
		"Go with me, Silvius.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT IV\n"+
		"SCENE I. The forest.\n"+
		"Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and JAQUES\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted\n"+
		"with thee.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"They say you are a melancholy fellow.\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"I am so; I do love it better than laughing.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Those that are in extremity of either are abominable\n"+
		"fellows and betray themselves to every modern\n"+
		"censure worse than drunkards.\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Why then, 'tis good to be a post.\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which is\n"+
		"emulation, nor the musician's, which is fantastical,\n"+
		"nor the courtier's, which is proud, nor the\n"+
		"soldier's, which is ambitious, nor the lawyer's,\n"+
		"which is politic, nor the lady's, which is nice, nor\n"+
		"the lover's, which is all these: but it is a\n"+
		"melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples,\n"+
		"extracted from many objects, and indeed the sundry's\n"+
		"contemplation of my travels, in which my often\n"+
		"rumination wraps me m a most humorous sadness.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to\n"+
		"be sad: I fear you have sold your own lands to see\n"+
		"other men's; then, to have seen much and to have\n"+
		"nothing, is to have rich eyes and poor hands.\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"Yes, I have gained my experience.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"And your experience makes you sad: I had rather have\n"+
		"a fool to make me merry than experience to make me\n"+
		"sad; and to travel for it too!\n"+
		"Enter ORLANDO\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Good day and happiness, dear Rosalind!\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"Nay, then, God be wi' you, an you talk in blank verse.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Farewell, Monsieur Traveller: look you lisp and\n"+
		"wear strange suits, disable all the benefits of your\n"+
		"own country, be out of love with your nativity and\n"+
		"almost chide God for making you that countenance you\n"+
		"are, or I will scarce think you have swam in a\n"+
		"gondola. Why, how now, Orlando! where have you been\n"+
		"all this while? You a lover! An you serve me such\n"+
		"another trick, never come in my sight more.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Break an hour's promise in love! He that will\n"+
		"divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but\n"+
		"a part of the thousandth part of a minute in the\n"+
		"affairs of love, it may be said of him that Cupid\n"+
		"hath clapped him o' the shoulder, but I'll warrant\n"+
		"him heart-whole.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Pardon me, dear Rosalind.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight: I\n"+
		"had as lief be wooed of a snail.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Of a snail?\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he\n"+
		"carries his house on his head; a better jointure,\n"+
		"I think, than you make a woman: besides he brings\n"+
		"his destiny with him.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"What's that?\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Why, horns, which such as you are fain to be\n"+
		"beholding to your wives for: but he comes armed in\n"+
		"his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Virtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"And I am your Rosalind.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"It pleases him to call you so; but he hath a\n"+
		"Rosalind of a better leer than you.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Come, woo me, woo me, for now I am in a holiday\n"+
		"humour and like enough to consent. What would you\n"+
		"say to me now, an I were your very very Rosalind?\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"I would kiss before I spoke.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Nay, you were better speak first, and when you were\n"+
		"gravelled for lack of matter, you might take\n"+
		"occasion to kiss. Very good orators, when they are\n"+
		"out, they will spit; and for lovers lacking--God\n"+
		"warn us!--matter, the cleanliest shift is to kiss.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"How if the kiss be denied?\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new matter.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress, or\n"+
		"I should think my honesty ranker than my wit.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"What, of my suit?\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit.\n"+
		"Am not I your Rosalind?\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"I take some joy to say you are, because I would be\n"+
		"talking of her.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Well in her person I say I will not have you.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Then in mine own person I die.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is\n"+
		"almost six thousand years old, and in all this time\n"+
		"there was not any man died in his own person,\n"+
		"videlicit, in a love-cause. Troilus had his brains\n"+
		"dashed out with a Grecian club; yet he did what he\n"+
		"could to die before, and he is one of the patterns\n"+
		"of love. Leander, he would have lived many a fair\n"+
		"year, though Hero had turned nun, if it had not been\n"+
		"for a hot midsummer night; for, good youth, he went\n"+
		"but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being\n"+
		"taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish\n"+
		"coroners of that age found it was 'Hero of Sestos.'\n"+
		"But these are all lies: men have died from time to\n"+
		"time and worms have eaten them, but not for love.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind,\n"+
		"for, I protest, her frown might kill me.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now\n"+
		"I will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on\n"+
		"disposition, and ask me what you will. I will grant\n"+
		"it.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Then love me, Rosalind.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"And wilt thou have me?\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Ay, and twenty such.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"What sayest thou?\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Are you not good?\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"I hope so.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing?\n"+
		"Come, sister, you shall be the priest and marry us.\n"+
		"Give me your hand, Orlando. What do you say, sister?\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Pray thee, marry us.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"I cannot say the words.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"You must begin, 'Will you, Orlando--'\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"I will.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Ay, but when?\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Why now; as fast as she can marry us.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"I might ask you for your commission; but I do take\n"+
		"thee, Orlando, for my husband: there's a girl goes\n"+
		"before the priest; and certainly a woman's thought\n"+
		"runs before her actions.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"So do all thoughts; they are winged.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Now tell me how long you would have her after you\n"+
		"have possessed her.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"For ever and a day.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Say 'a day,' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando;\n"+
		"men are April when they woo, December when they wed:\n"+
		"maids are May when they are maids, but the sky\n"+
		"changes when they are wives. I will be more jealous\n"+
		"of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen,\n"+
		"more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more\n"+
		"new-fangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires\n"+
		"than a monkey: I will weep for nothing, like Diana\n"+
		"in the fountain, and I will do that when you are\n"+
		"disposed to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen, and\n"+
		"that when thou art inclined to sleep.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"But will my Rosalind do so?\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"By my life, she will do as I do.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"O, but she is wise.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Or else she could not have the wit to do this: the\n"+
		"wiser, the waywarder: make the doors upon a woman's\n"+
		"wit and it will out at the casement; shut that and\n"+
		"'twill out at the key-hole; stop that, 'twill fly\n"+
		"with the smoke out at the chimney.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say\n"+
		"'Wit, whither wilt?'\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Nay, you might keep that cheque for it till you met\n"+
		"your wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"And what wit could wit have to excuse that?\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall\n"+
		"never take her without her answer, unless you take\n"+
		"her without her tongue. O, that woman that cannot\n"+
		"make her fault her husband's occasion, let her\n"+
		"never nurse her child herself, for she will breed\n"+
		"it like a fool!\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Alas! dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"I must attend the duke at dinner: by two o'clock I\n"+
		"will be with thee again.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Ay, go your ways, go your ways; I knew what you\n"+
		"would prove: my friends told me as much, and I\n"+
		"thought no less: that flattering tongue of yours\n"+
		"won me: 'tis but one cast away, and so, come,\n"+
		"death! Two o'clock is your hour?\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Ay, sweet Rosalind.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend\n"+
		"me, and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous,\n"+
		"if you break one jot of your promise or come one\n"+
		"minute behind your hour, I will think you the most\n"+
		"pathetical break-promise and the most hollow lover\n"+
		"and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that\n"+
		"may be chosen out of the gross band of the\n"+
		"unfaithful: therefore beware my censure and keep\n"+
		"your promise.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my\n"+
		"Rosalind: so adieu.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such\n"+
		"offenders, and let Time try: adieu.\n"+
		"Exit ORLANDO\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"You have simply misused our sex in your love-prate:\n"+
		"we must have your doublet and hose plucked over your\n"+
		"head, and show the world what the bird hath done to\n"+
		"her own nest.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou\n"+
		"didst know how many fathom deep I am in love! But\n"+
		"it cannot be sounded: my affection hath an unknown\n"+
		"bottom, like the bay of Portugal.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"Or rather, bottomless, that as fast as you pour\n"+
		"affection in, it runs out.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"No, that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot\n"+
		"of thought, conceived of spleen and born of madness,\n"+
		"that blind rascally boy that abuses every one's eyes\n"+
		"because his own are out, let him be judge how deep I\n"+
		"am in love. I'll tell thee, Aliena, I cannot be out\n"+
		"of the sight of Orlando: I'll go find a shadow and\n"+
		"sigh till he come.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"And I'll sleep.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. The forest.\n"+
		"Enter JAQUES, Lords, and Foresters\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"Which is he that killed the deer?\n"+
		"A Lord\n"+
		"Sir, it was I.\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"Let's present him to the duke, like a Roman\n"+
		"conqueror; and it would do well to set the deer's\n"+
		"horns upon his head, for a branch of victory. Have\n"+
		"you no song, forester, for this purpose?\n"+
		"Forester\n"+
		"Yes, sir.\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"Sing it: 'tis no matter how it be in tune, so it\n"+
		"make noise enough.\n"+
		"SONG.\n"+
		"Forester\n"+
		"What shall he have that kill'd the deer?\n"+
		"His leather skin and horns to wear.\n"+
		"Then sing him home;\n"+
		"The rest shall bear this burden\n"+
		"Take thou no scorn to wear the horn;\n"+
		"It was a crest ere thou wast born:\n"+
		"Thy father's father wore it,\n"+
		"And thy father bore it:\n"+
		"The horn, the horn, the lusty horn\n"+
		"Is not a thing to laugh to scorn.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. The forest.\n"+
		"Enter ROSALIND and CELIA\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"How say you now? Is it not past two o'clock? and\n"+
		"here much Orlando!\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"I warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain, he\n"+
		"hath ta'en his bow and arrows and is gone forth to\n"+
		"sleep. Look, who comes here.\n"+
		"Enter SILVIUS\n"+
		"SILVIUS\n"+
		"My errand is to you, fair youth;\n"+
		"My gentle Phebe bid me give you this:\n"+
		"I know not the contents; but, as I guess\n"+
		"By the stern brow and waspish action\n"+
		"Which she did use as she was writing of it,\n"+
		"It bears an angry tenor: pardon me:\n"+
		"I am but as a guiltless messenger.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Patience herself would startle at this letter\n"+
		"And play the swaggerer; bear this, bear all:\n"+
		"She says I am not fair, that I lack manners;\n"+
		"She calls me proud, and that she could not love me,\n"+
		"Were man as rare as phoenix. 'Od's my will!\n"+
		"Her love is not the hare that I do hunt:\n"+
		"Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,\n"+
		"This is a letter of your own device.\n"+
		"SILVIUS\n"+
		"No, I protest, I know not the contents:\n"+
		"Phebe did write it.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Come, come, you are a fool\n"+
		"And turn'd into the extremity of love.\n"+
		"I saw her hand: she has a leathern hand.\n"+
		"A freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think\n"+
		"That her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands:\n"+
		"She has a huswife's hand; but that's no matter:\n"+
		"I say she never did invent this letter;\n"+
		"This is a man's invention and his hand.\n"+
		"SILVIUS\n"+
		"Sure, it is hers.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style.\n"+
		"A style for-challengers; why, she defies me,\n"+
		"Like Turk to Christian: women's gentle brain\n"+
		"Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention\n"+
		"Such Ethiope words, blacker in their effect\n"+
		"Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?\n"+
		"SILVIUS\n"+
		"So please you, for I never heard it yet;\n"+
		"Yet heard too much of Phebe's cruelty.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"She Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes.\n"+
		"Reads\n"+
		"Art thou god to shepherd turn'd,\n"+
		"That a maiden's heart hath burn'd?\n"+
		"Can a woman rail thus?\n"+
		"SILVIUS\n"+
		"Call you this railing?\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"[Reads]\n"+
		"Why, thy godhead laid apart,\n"+
		"Warr'st thou with a woman's heart?\n"+
		"Did you ever hear such railing?\n"+
		"Whiles the eye of man did woo me,\n"+
		"That could do no vengeance to me.\n"+
		"Meaning me a beast.\n"+
		"If the scorn of your bright eyne\n"+
		"Have power to raise such love in mine,\n"+
		"Alack, in me what strange effect\n"+
		"Would they work in mild aspect!\n"+
		"Whiles you chid me, I did love;\n"+
		"How then might your prayers move!\n"+
		"He that brings this love to thee\n"+
		"Little knows this love in me:\n"+
		"And by him seal up thy mind;\n"+
		"Whether that thy youth and kind\n"+
		"Will the faithful offer take\n"+
		"Of me and all that I can make;\n"+
		"Or else by him my love deny,\n"+
		"And then I'll study how to die.\n"+
		"SILVIUS\n"+
		"Call you this chiding?\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"Alas, poor shepherd!\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Do you pity him? no, he deserves no pity. Wilt\n"+
		"thou love such a woman? What, to make thee an\n"+
		"instrument and play false strains upon thee! not to\n"+
		"be endured! Well, go your way to her, for I see\n"+
		"love hath made thee a tame snake, and say this to\n"+
		"her: that if she love me, I charge her to love\n"+
		"thee; if she will not, I will never have her unless\n"+
		"thou entreat for her. If you be a true lover,\n"+
		"hence, and not a word; for here comes more company.\n"+
		"Exit SILVIUS\n"+
		"Enter OLIVER\n"+
		"OLIVER\n"+
		"Good morrow, fair ones: pray you, if you know,\n"+
		"Where in the purlieus of this forest stands\n"+
		"A sheep-cote fenced about with olive trees?\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"West of this place, down in the neighbour bottom:\n"+
		"The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream\n"+
		"Left on your right hand brings you to the place.\n"+
		"But at this hour the house doth keep itself;\n"+
		"There's none within.\n"+
		"OLIVER\n"+
		"If that an eye may profit by a tongue,\n"+
		"Then should I know you by description;\n"+
		"Such garments and such years: 'The boy is fair,\n"+
		"Of female favour, and bestows himself\n"+
		"Like a ripe sister: the woman low\n"+
		"And browner than her brother.' Are not you\n"+
		"The owner of the house I did inquire for?\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.\n"+
		"OLIVER\n"+
		"Orlando doth commend him to you both,\n"+
		"And to that youth he calls his Rosalind\n"+
		"He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"I am: what must we understand by this?\n"+
		"OLIVER\n"+
		"Some of my shame; if you will know of me\n"+
		"What man I am, and how, and why, and where\n"+
		"This handkercher was stain'd.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"I pray you, tell it.\n"+
		"OLIVER\n"+
		"When last the young Orlando parted from you\n"+
		"He left a promise to return again\n"+
		"Within an hour, and pacing through the forest,\n"+
		"Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,\n"+
		"Lo, what befell! he threw his eye aside,\n"+
		"And mark what object did present itself:\n"+
		"Under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with age\n"+
		"And high top bald with dry antiquity,\n"+
		"A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,\n"+
		"Lay sleeping on his back: about his neck\n"+
		"A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself,\n"+
		"Who with her head nimble in threats approach'd\n"+
		"The opening of his mouth; but suddenly,\n"+
		"Seeing Orlando, it unlink'd itself,\n"+
		"And with indented glides did slip away\n"+
		"Into a bush: under which bush's shade\n"+
		"A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,\n"+
		"Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch,\n"+
		"When that the sleeping man should stir; for 'tis\n"+
		"The royal disposition of that beast\n"+
		"To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead:\n"+
		"This seen, Orlando did approach the man\n"+
		"And found it was his brother, his elder brother.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"O, I have heard him speak of that same brother;\n"+
		"And he did render him the most unnatural\n"+
		"That lived amongst men.\n"+
		"OLIVER\n"+
		"And well he might so do,\n"+
		"For well I know he was unnatural.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,\n"+
		"Food to the suck'd and hungry lioness?\n"+
		"OLIVER\n"+
		"Twice did he turn his back and purposed so;\n"+
		"But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,\n"+
		"And nature, stronger than his just occasion,\n"+
		"Made him give battle to the lioness,\n"+
		"Who quickly fell before him: in which hurtling\n"+
		"From miserable slumber I awaked.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"Are you his brother?\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Wast you he rescued?\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?\n"+
		"OLIVER\n"+
		"'Twas I; but 'tis not I I do not shame\n"+
		"To tell you what I was, since my conversion\n"+
		"So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"But, for the bloody napkin?\n"+
		"OLIVER\n"+
		"By and by.\n"+
		"When from the first to last betwixt us two\n"+
		"Tears our recountments had most kindly bathed,\n"+
		"As how I came into that desert place:--\n"+
		"In brief, he led me to the gentle duke,\n"+
		"Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,\n"+
		"Committing me unto my brother's love;\n"+
		"Who led me instantly unto his cave,\n"+
		"There stripp'd himself, and here upon his arm\n"+
		"The lioness had torn some flesh away,\n"+
		"Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted\n"+
		"And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind.\n"+
		"Brief, I recover'd him, bound up his wound;\n"+
		"And, after some small space, being strong at heart,\n"+
		"He sent me hither, stranger as I am,\n"+
		"To tell this story, that you might excuse\n"+
		"His broken promise, and to give this napkin\n"+
		"Dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth\n"+
		"That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.\n"+
		"ROSALIND swoons\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"Why, how now, Ganymede! sweet Ganymede!\n"+
		"OLIVER\n"+
		"Many will swoon when they do look on blood.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"There is more in it. Cousin Ganymede!\n"+
		"OLIVER\n"+
		"Look, he recovers.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"I would I were at home.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"We'll lead you thither.\n"+
		"I pray you, will you take him by the arm?\n"+
		"OLIVER\n"+
		"Be of good cheer, youth: you a man! you lack a\n"+
		"man's heart.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"I do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body would\n"+
		"think this was well counterfeited! I pray you, tell\n"+
		"your brother how well I counterfeited. Heigh-ho!\n"+
		"OLIVER\n"+
		"This was not counterfeit: there is too great\n"+
		"testimony in your complexion that it was a passion\n"+
		"of earnest.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Counterfeit, I assure you.\n"+
		"OLIVER\n"+
		"Well then, take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"So I do: but, i' faith, I should have been a woman by right.\n"+
		"CELIA\n"+
		"Come, you look paler and paler: pray you, draw\n"+
		"homewards. Good sir, go with us.\n"+
		"OLIVER\n"+
		"That will I, for I must bear answer back\n"+
		"How you excuse my brother, Rosalind.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"I shall devise something: but, I pray you, commend\n"+
		"my counterfeiting to him. Will you go?\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT V\n"+
		"SCENE I. The forest.\n"+
		"Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"We shall find a time, Audrey; patience, gentle Audrey.\n"+
		"AUDREY\n"+
		"Faith, the priest was good enough, for all the old\n"+
		"gentleman's saying.\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"A most wicked Sir Oliver, Audrey, a most vile\n"+
		"Martext. But, Audrey, there is a youth here in the\n"+
		"forest lays claim to you.\n"+
		"AUDREY\n"+
		"Ay, I know who 'tis; he hath no interest in me in\n"+
		"the world: here comes the man you mean.\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"It is meat and drink to me to see a clown: by my\n"+
		"troth, we that have good wits have much to answer\n"+
		"for; we shall be flouting; we cannot hold.\n"+
		"Enter WILLIAM\n"+
		"WILLIAM\n"+
		"Good even, Audrey.\n"+
		"AUDREY\n"+
		"God ye good even, William.\n"+
		"WILLIAM\n"+
		"And good even to you, sir.\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"Good even, gentle friend. Cover thy head, cover thy\n"+
		"head; nay, prithee, be covered. How old are you, friend?\n"+
		"WILLIAM\n"+
		"Five and twenty, sir.\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"A ripe age. Is thy name William?\n"+
		"WILLIAM\n"+
		"William, sir.\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"A fair name. Wast born i' the forest here?\n"+
		"WILLIAM\n"+
		"Ay, sir, I thank God.\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"'Thank God;' a good answer. Art rich?\n"+
		"WILLIAM\n"+
		"Faith, sir, so so.\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"'So so' is good, very good, very excellent good; and\n"+
		"yet it is not; it is but so so. Art thou wise?\n"+
		"WILLIAM\n"+
		"Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit.\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"Why, thou sayest well. I do now remember a saying,\n"+
		"'The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man\n"+
		"knows himself to be a fool.' The heathen\n"+
		"philosopher, when he had a desire to eat a grape,\n"+
		"would open his lips when he put it into his mouth;\n"+
		"meaning thereby that grapes were made to eat and\n"+
		"lips to open. You do love this maid?\n"+
		"WILLIAM\n"+
		"I do, sir.\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"Give me your hand. Art thou learned?\n"+
		"WILLIAM\n"+
		"No, sir.\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"Then learn this of me: to have, is to have; for it\n"+
		"is a figure in rhetoric that drink, being poured out\n"+
		"of a cup into a glass, by filling the one doth empty\n"+
		"the other; for all your writers do consent that ipse\n"+
		"is he: now, you are not ipse, for I am he.\n"+
		"WILLIAM\n"+
		"Which he, sir?\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"He, sir, that must marry this woman. Therefore, you\n"+
		"clown, abandon,--which is in the vulgar leave,--the\n"+
		"society,--which in the boorish is company,--of this\n"+
		"female,--which in the common is woman; which\n"+
		"together is, abandon the society of this female, or,\n"+
		"clown, thou perishest; or, to thy better\n"+
		"understanding, diest; or, to wit I kill thee, make\n"+
		"thee away, translate thy life into death, thy\n"+
		"liberty into bondage: I will deal in poison with\n"+
		"thee, or in bastinado, or in steel; I will bandy\n"+
		"with thee in faction; I will o'errun thee with\n"+
		"policy; I will kill thee a hundred and fifty ways:\n"+
		"therefore tremble and depart.\n"+
		"AUDREY\n"+
		"Do, good William.\n"+
		"WILLIAM\n"+
		"God rest you merry, sir.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"Enter CORIN\n"+
		"CORIN\n"+
		"Our master and mistress seeks you; come, away, away!\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"Trip, Audrey! trip, Audrey! I attend, I attend.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. The forest.\n"+
		"Enter ORLANDO and OLIVER\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Is't possible that on so little acquaintance you\n"+
		"should like her? that but seeing you should love\n"+
		"her? and loving woo? and, wooing, she should\n"+
		"grant? and will you persever to enjoy her?\n"+
		"OLIVER\n"+
		"Neither call the giddiness of it in question, the\n"+
		"poverty of her, the small acquaintance, my sudden\n"+
		"wooing, nor her sudden consenting; but say with me,\n"+
		"I love Aliena; say with her that she loves me;\n"+
		"consent with both that we may enjoy each other: it\n"+
		"shall be to your good; for my father's house and all\n"+
		"the revenue that was old Sir Rowland's will I\n"+
		"estate upon you, and here live and die a shepherd.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"You have my consent. Let your wedding be to-morrow:\n"+
		"thither will I invite the duke and all's contented\n"+
		"followers. Go you and prepare Aliena; for look\n"+
		"you, here comes my Rosalind.\n"+
		"Enter ROSALIND\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"God save you, brother.\n"+
		"OLIVER\n"+
		"And you, fair sister.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"O, my dear Orlando, how it grieves me to see thee\n"+
		"wear thy heart in a scarf!\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"It is my arm.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws\n"+
		"of a lion.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to\n"+
		"swoon when he showed me your handkerchief?\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Ay, and greater wonders than that.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"O, I know where you are: nay, 'tis true: there was\n"+
		"never any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams\n"+
		"and Caesar's thrasonical brag of 'I came, saw, and\n"+
		"overcame:' for your brother and my sister no sooner\n"+
		"met but they looked, no sooner looked but they\n"+
		"loved, no sooner loved but they sighed, no sooner\n"+
		"sighed but they asked one another the reason, no\n"+
		"sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy;\n"+
		"and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs\n"+
		"to marriage which they will climb incontinent, or\n"+
		"else be incontinent before marriage: they are in\n"+
		"the very wrath of love and they will together; clubs\n"+
		"cannot part them.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"They shall be married to-morrow, and I will bid the\n"+
		"duke to the nuptial. But, O, how bitter a thing it\n"+
		"is to look into happiness through another man's\n"+
		"eyes! By so much the more shall I to-morrow be at\n"+
		"the height of heart-heaviness, by how much I shall\n"+
		"think my brother happy in having what he wishes for.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Why then, to-morrow I cannot serve your turn for Rosalind?\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"I can live no longer by thinking.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"I will weary you then no longer with idle talking.\n"+
		"Know of me then, for now I speak to some purpose,\n"+
		"that I know you are a gentleman of good conceit: I\n"+
		"speak not this that you should bear a good opinion\n"+
		"of my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you are;\n"+
		"neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in\n"+
		"some little measure draw a belief from you, to do\n"+
		"yourself good and not to grace me. Believe then, if\n"+
		"you please, that I can do strange things: I have,\n"+
		"since I was three year old, conversed with a\n"+
		"magician, most profound in his art and yet not\n"+
		"damnable. If you do love Rosalind so near the heart\n"+
		"as your gesture cries it out, when your brother\n"+
		"marries Aliena, shall you marry her: I know into\n"+
		"what straits of fortune she is driven; and it is\n"+
		"not impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient\n"+
		"to you, to set her before your eyes tomorrow human\n"+
		"as she is and without any danger.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"Speakest thou in sober meanings?\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"By my life, I do; which I tender dearly, though I\n"+
		"say I am a magician. Therefore, put you in your\n"+
		"best array: bid your friends; for if you will be\n"+
		"married to-morrow, you shall, and to Rosalind, if you will.\n"+
		"Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE\n"+
		"Look, here comes a lover of mine and a lover of hers.\n"+
		"PHEBE\n"+
		"Youth, you have done me much ungentleness,\n"+
		"To show the letter that I writ to you.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"I care not if I have: it is my study\n"+
		"To seem despiteful and ungentle to you:\n"+
		"You are there followed by a faithful shepherd;\n"+
		"Look upon him, love him; he worships you.\n"+
		"PHEBE\n"+
		"Good shepherd, tell this youth what 'tis to love.\n"+
		"SILVIUS\n"+
		"It is to be all made of sighs and tears;\n"+
		"And so am I for Phebe.\n"+
		"PHEBE\n"+

		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"And I for Rosalind.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"And I for no woman.\n"+
		"SILVIUS\n"+
		"It is to be all made of faith and service;\n"+
		"And so am I for Phebe.\n"+
		"PHEBE\n"+
		"And I for Ganymede.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"And I for Rosalind.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"And I for no woman.\n"+
		"SILVIUS\n"+
		"It is to be all made of fantasy,\n"+
		"All made of passion and all made of wishes,\n"+
		"All adoration, duty, and observance,\n"+
		"All humbleness, all patience and impatience,\n"+
		"All purity, all trial, all observance;\n"+
		"And so am I for Phebe.\n"+
		"PHEBE\n"+
		"And so am I for Ganymede.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"And so am I for Rosalind.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"And so am I for no woman.\n"+
		"PHEBE\n"+
		"If this be so, why blame you me to love you?\n"+
		"SILVIUS\n"+
		"If this be so, why blame you me to love you?\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"If this be so, why blame you me to love you?\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Who do you speak to, 'Why blame you me to love you?'\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"To her that is not here, nor doth not hear.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Pray you, no more of this; 'tis like the howling\n"+
		"of Irish wolves against the moon.\n"+
		"To SILVIUS\n"+
		"I will help you, if I can:\n"+
		"To PHEBE\n"+
		"I would love you, if I could. To-morrow meet me all together.\n"+
		"To PHEBE\n"+
		"I will marry you, if ever I marry woman, and I'll be\n"+
		"married to-morrow:\n"+
		"To ORLANDO\n"+
		"I will satisfy you, if ever I satisfied man, and you\n"+
		"shall be married to-morrow:\n"+
		"To SILVIUS\n"+
		"I will content you, if what pleases you contents\n"+
		"you, and you shall be married to-morrow.\n"+
		"To ORLANDO\n"+
		"As you love Rosalind, meet:\n"+
		"To SILVIUS\n"+
		"as you love Phebe, meet: and as I love no woman,\n"+
		"I'll meet. So fare you well: I have left you commands.\n"+

		"We are for you: sit i' the middle.\n"+
		"First Page\n"+
		"Shall we clap into't roundly, without hawking or\n"+
		"spitting or saying we are hoarse, which are the only\n"+
		"prologues to a bad voice?\n"+
		"Second Page\n"+
		"I'faith, i'faith; and both in a tune, like two\n"+

		"SONG.\n"+
		"It was a lover and his lass,\n"+
		"With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,\n"+
		"That o'er the green corn-field did pass\n"+
		"In the spring time, the only pretty ring time,\n"+
		"When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding:\n"+
		"Sweet lovers love the spring.\n"+
		"Between the acres of the rye,\n"+
		"With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino\n"+
		"These pretty country folks would lie,\n"+
		"In spring time, & c.\n"+
		"This carol they began that hour,\n"+
		"With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,\n"+
		"How that a life was but a flower\n"+
		"In spring time, & c.\n"+
		"And therefore take the present time,\n"+
		"With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino;\n"+
		"For love is crowned with the prime\n"+
		"In spring time, & c.\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"Truly, young gentlemen, though there was no great\n"+
		"matter in the ditty, yet the note was very\n"+
		"untuneable.\n"+
		"First Page\n"+
		"You are deceived, sir: we kept time, we lost not our time.\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"By my troth, yes; I count it but time lost to hear\n"+
		"such a foolish song. God be wi' you; and God mend\n"+
		"your voices! Come, Audrey.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV. The forest.\n"+
		"Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, JAQUES, ORLANDO, OLIVER, and CELIA\n"+
		"DUKE SENIOR\n"+
		"Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy\n"+
		"Can do all this that he hath promised?\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"I sometimes do believe, and sometimes do not;\n"+
		"As those that fear they hope, and know they fear.\n"+
		"Enter ROSALIND, SILVIUS, and PHEBE\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"Patience once more, whiles our compact is urged:\n"+
		"You say, if I bring in your Rosalind,\n"+
		"You will bestow her on Orlando here?\n"+
		"DUKE SENIOR\n"+
		"That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"And you say, you will have her, when I bring her?\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"That would I, were I of all kingdoms king.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"You say, you'll marry me, if I be willing?\n"+
		"PHEBE\n"+
		"That will I, should I die the hour after.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"But if you do refuse to marry me,\n"+
		"You'll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?\n"+
		"PHEBE\n"+
		"So is the bargain.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"You say, that you'll have Phebe, if she will?\n"+
		"SILVIUS\n"+
		"Though to have her and death were both one thing.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"I have promised to make all this matter even.\n"+
		"Keep you your word, O duke, to give your daughter;\n"+
		"You yours, Orlando, to receive his daughter:\n"+
		"Keep your word, Phebe, that you'll marry me,\n"+
		"Or else refusing me, to wed this shepherd:\n"+
		"Keep your word, Silvius, that you'll marry her.\n"+
		"If she refuse me: and from hence I go,\n"+
		"To make these doubts all even.\n"+
		"Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA\n"+
		"DUKE SENIOR\n"+
		"I do remember in this shepherd boy\n"+
		"Some lively touches of my daughter's favour.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"My lord, the first time that I ever saw him\n"+
		"Methought he was a brother to your daughter:\n"+
		"But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born,\n"+
		"And hath been tutor'd in the rudiments\n"+
		"Of many desperate studies by his uncle,\n"+
		"Whom he reports to be a great magician,\n"+
		"Obscured in the circle of this forest.\n"+
		"Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"There is, sure, another flood toward, and these\n"+
		"couples are coming to the ark. Here comes a pair of\n"+
		"very strange beasts, which in all tongues are called fools.\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"Salutation and greeting to you all!\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"Good my lord, bid him welcome: this is the\n"+
		"motley-minded gentleman that I have so often met in\n"+
		"the forest: he hath been a courtier, he swears.\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"If any man doubt that, let him put me to my\n"+
		"purgation. I have trod a measure; I have flattered\n"+
		"a lady; I have been politic with my friend, smooth\n"+
		"with mine enemy; I have undone three tailors; I have\n"+
		"had four quarrels, and like to have fought one.\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"And how was that ta'en up?\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"Faith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the\n"+
		"seventh cause.\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"How seventh cause? Good my lord, like this fellow.\n"+
		"DUKE SENIOR\n"+
		"I like him very well.\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"God 'ild you, sir; I desire you of the like. I\n"+
		"press in here, sir, amongst the rest of the country\n"+
		"copulatives, to swear and to forswear: according as\n"+
		"marriage binds and blood breaks: a poor virgin,\n"+
		"sir, an ill-favoured thing, sir, but mine own; a poor\n"+
		"humour of mine, sir, to take that that no man else\n"+
		"will: rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a\n"+
		"poor house; as your pearl in your foul oyster.\n"+
		"DUKE SENIOR\n"+
		"By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"According to the fool's bolt, sir, and such dulcet diseases.\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"But, for the seventh cause; how did you find the\n"+
		"quarrel on the seventh cause?\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"Upon a lie seven times removed:--bear your body more\n"+
		"seeming, Audrey:--as thus, sir. I did dislike the\n"+
		"cut of a certain courtier's beard: he sent me word,\n"+
		"if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the\n"+
		"mind it was: this is called the Retort Courteous.\n"+
		"If I sent him word again 'it was not well cut,' he\n"+
		"would send me word, he cut it to please himself:\n"+
		"this is called the Quip Modest. If again 'it was\n"+
		"not well cut,' he disabled my judgment: this is\n"+
		"called the Reply Churlish. If again 'it was not\n"+
		"well cut,' he would answer, I spake not true: this\n"+
		"is called the Reproof Valiant. If again 'it was not\n"+
		"well cut,' he would say I lied: this is called the\n"+
		"Counter-cheque Quarrelsome: and so to the Lie\n"+
		"Circumstantial and the Lie Direct.\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial,\n"+
		"nor he durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we\n"+
		"measured swords and parted.\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?\n"+
		"TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"O sir, we quarrel in print, by the book; as you have\n"+
		"books for good manners: I will name you the degrees.\n"+
		"The first, the Retort Courteous; the second, the\n"+
		"Quip Modest; the third, the Reply Churlish; the\n"+
		"fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth, the\n"+
		"Countercheque Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with\n"+
		"Circumstance; the seventh, the Lie Direct. All\n"+
		"these you may avoid but the Lie Direct; and you may\n"+
		"avoid that too, with an If. I knew when seven\n"+
		"justices could not take up a quarrel, but when the\n"+
		"parties were met themselves, one of them thought but\n"+
		"of an If, as, 'If you said so, then I said so;' and\n"+
		"they shook hands and swore brothers. Your If is the\n"+
		"only peacemaker; much virtue in If.\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"Is not this a rare fellow, my lord? he's as good at\n"+
		"any thing and yet a fool.\n"+
		"DUKE SENIOR\n"+
		"He uses his folly like a stalking-horse and under\n"+
		"the presentation of that he shoots his wit.\n"+
		"Enter HYMEN, ROSALIND, and CELIA\n"+
		"Still Music\n"+
		"HYMEN\n"+
		"Then is there mirth in heaven,\n"+
		"When earthly things made even\n"+
		"Atone together.\n"+
		"Good duke, receive thy daughter\n"+
		"Hymen from heaven brought her,\n"+
		"Yea, brought her hither,\n"+
		"That thou mightst join her hand with his\n"+
		"Whose heart within his bosom is.\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"[To DUKE SENIOR] To you I give myself, for I am yours.\n"+
		"To ORLANDO\n"+
		"To you I give myself, for I am yours.\n"+
		"DUKE SENIOR\n"+
		"If there be truth in sight, you are my daughter.\n"+
		"ORLANDO\n"+
		"If there be truth in sight, you are my Rosalind.\n"+
		"PHEBE\n"+
		"If sight and shape be true,\n"+
		"Why then, my love adieu!\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"I'll have no father, if you be not he:\n"+
		"I'll have no husband, if you be not he:\n"+
		"Nor ne'er wed woman, if you be not she.\n"+
		"HYMEN\n"+
		"Peace, ho! I bar confusion:\n"+
		"'Tis I must make conclusion\n"+
		"Of these most strange events:\n"+
		"Here's eight that must take hands\n"+
		"To join in Hymen's bands,\n"+
		"If truth holds true contents.\n"+
		"You and you no cross shall part:\n"+
		"You and you are heart in heart\n"+
		"You to his love must accord,\n"+
		"Or have a woman to your lord:\n"+
		"You and you are sure together,\n"+
		"As the winter to foul weather.\n"+
		"Whiles a wedlock-hymn we sing,\n"+
		"Feed yourselves with questioning;\n"+
		"That reason wonder may diminish,\n"+
		"How thus we met, and these things finish.\n"+
		"SONG.\n"+
		"Wedding is great Juno's crown:\n"+
		"O blessed bond of board and bed!\n"+
		"'Tis Hymen peoples every town;\n"+
		"High wedlock then be honoured:\n"+
		"Honour, high honour and renown,\n"+
		"To Hymen, god of every town!\n"+
		"DUKE SENIOR\n"+
		"O my dear niece, welcome thou art to me!\n"+
		"Even daughter, welcome, in no less degree.\n"+
		"PHEBE\n"+
		"I will not eat my word, now thou art mine;\n"+
		"Thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine.\n"+
		"Enter JAQUES DE BOYS\n"+
		"JAQUES DE BOYS\n"+
		"Let me have audience for a word or two:\n"+
		"I am the second son of old Sir Rowland,\n"+
		"That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.\n"+
		"Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day\n"+
		"Men of great worth resorted to this forest,\n"+
		"Address'd a mighty power; which were on foot,\n"+
		"In his own conduct, purposely to take\n"+
		"His brother here and put him to the sword:\n"+
		"And to the skirts of this wild wood he came;\n"+
		"Where meeting with an old religious man,\n"+
		"After some question with him, was converted\n"+
		"Both from his enterprise and from the world,\n"+
		"His crown bequeathing to his banish'd brother,\n"+
		"And all their lands restored to them again\n"+
		"That were with him exiled. This to be true,\n"+
		"I do engage my life.\n"+
		"DUKE SENIOR\n"+
		"Welcome, young man;\n"+
		"Thou offer'st fairly to thy brothers' wedding:\n"+
		"To one his lands withheld, and to the other\n"+
		"A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.\n"+
		"First, in this forest, let us do those ends\n"+
		"That here were well begun and well begot:\n"+
		"And after, every of this happy number\n"+
		"That have endured shrewd days and nights with us\n"+
		"Shall share the good of our returned fortune,\n"+
		"According to the measure of their states.\n"+
		"Meantime, forget this new-fall'n dignity\n"+
		"And fall into our rustic revelry.\n"+
		"Play, music! And you, brides and bridegrooms all,\n"+
		"With measure heap'd in joy, to the measures fall.\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"Sir, by your patience. If I heard you rightly,\n"+
		"The duke hath put on a religious life\n"+
		"And thrown into neglect the pompous court?\n"+
		"JAQUES DE BOYS\n"+
		"He hath.\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"To him will I : out of these convertites\n"+
		"There is much matter to be heard and learn'd.\n"+
		"To DUKE SENIOR\n"+
		"You to your former honour I bequeath;\n"+
		"Your patience and your virtue well deserves it:\n"+
		"To ORLANDO\n"+
		"You to a love that your true faith doth merit:\n"+
		"To OLIVER\n"+
		"You to your land and love and great allies:\n"+
		"To SILVIUS\n"+
		"You to a long and well-deserved bed:\n"+
		"To TOUCHSTONE\n"+
		"And you to wrangling; for thy loving voyage\n"+
		"Is but for two months victuall'd. So, to your pleasures:\n"+
		"I am for other than for dancing measures.\n"+
		"DUKE SENIOR\n"+
		"Stay, Jaques, stay.\n"+
		"JAQUES\n"+
		"To see no pastime I what you would have\n"+
		"I'll stay to know at your abandon'd cave.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"DUKE SENIOR\n"+
		"Proceed, proceed: we will begin these rites,\n"+
		"As we do trust they'll end, in true delights.\n"+
		"A dance\n"+
		"EPILOGUE\n"+
		"ROSALIND\n"+
		"It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue;\n"+
		"but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord\n"+
		"the prologue. If it be true that good wine needs\n"+
		"no bush, 'tis true that a good play needs no\n"+
		"epilogue; yet to good wine they do use good bushes,\n"+
		"and good plays prove the better by the help of good\n"+
		"epilogues. What a case am I in then, that am\n"+
		"neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with\n"+
		"you in the behalf of a good play! I am not\n"+
		"furnished like a beggar, therefore to beg will not\n"+
		"become me: my way is to conjure you; and I'll begin\n"+
		"with the women. I charge you, O women, for the love\n"+
		"you bear to men, to like as much of this play as\n"+
		"please you: and I charge you, O men, for the love\n"+
		"you bear to women--as I perceive by your simpering,\n"+
		"none of you hates them--that between you and the\n"+
		"women the play may please. If I were a woman I\n"+
		"would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased\n"+
		"me, complexions that liked me and breaths that I\n"+
		"defied not: and, I am sure, as many as have good\n"+
		"beards or good faces or sweet breaths will, for my\n"+
		"kind offer, when I make curtsy, bid me farewell.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"
