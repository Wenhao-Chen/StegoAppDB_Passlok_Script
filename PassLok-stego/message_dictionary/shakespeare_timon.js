		"Timon of Athens\n"+
		"ACT I\n"+
		"SCENE I. Athens. A hall in Timon's house.\n"+
		"Enter Poet, Painter, Jeweller, Merchant, and others, at several doors\n"+
		"Poet\n"+
		"Good day, sir.\n"+
		"Painter\n"+
		"I am glad you're well.\n"+
		"Poet\n"+
		"I have not seen you long: how goes the world?\n"+
		"Painter\n"+
		"It wears, sir, as it grows.\n"+
		"Poet\n"+
		"Ay, that's well known:\n"+
		"But what particular rarity? what strange,\n"+
		"Which manifold record not matches? See,\n"+
		"Magic of bounty! all these spirits thy power\n"+
		"Hath conjured to attend. I know the merchant.\n"+
		"Painter\n"+
		"I know them both; th' other's a jeweller.\n"+
		"Merchant\n"+
		"O, 'tis a worthy lord.\n"+
		"Jeweller\n"+
		"Nay, that's most fix'd.\n"+
		"Merchant\n"+
		"A most incomparable man, breathed, as it were,\n"+
		"To an untirable and continuate goodness:\n"+
		"He passes.\n"+
		"Jeweller: I have a jewel here--\n"+
		"Merchant\n"+
		"O, pray, let's see't: for the Lord Timon, sir?\n"+
		"Jeweller: If he will touch the estimate: but, for that--\n"+
		"Poet\n"+
		"[Reciting to himself] 'When we for recompense have\n"+
		"praised the vile,\n"+
		"It stains the glory in that happy verse\n"+
		"Which aptly sings the good.'\n"+
		"Merchant\n"+
		"'Tis a good form.\n"+
		"Looking at the jewel\n"+
		"Jeweller\n"+
		"And rich: here is a water, look ye.\n"+
		"Painter\n"+
		"You are rapt, sir, in some work, some dedication\n"+
		"To the great lord.\n"+
		"Poet\n"+
		"A thing slipp'd idly from me.\n"+
		"Our poesy is as a gum, which oozes\n"+
		"From whence 'tis nourish'd: the fire i' the flint\n"+
		"Shows not till it be struck; our gentle flame\n"+
		"Provokes itself and like the current flies\n"+
		"Each bound it chafes. What have you there?\n"+
		"Painter\n"+
		"A picture, sir. When comes your book forth?\n"+
		"Poet\n"+
		"Upon the heels of my presentment, sir.\n"+
		"Let's see your piece.\n"+
		"Painter\n"+
		"'Tis a good piece.\n"+
		"Poet\n"+
		"So 'tis: this comes off well and excellent.\n"+
		"Painter\n"+
		"Indifferent.\n"+
		"Poet\n"+
		"Admirable: how this grace\n"+
		"Speaks his own standing! what a mental power\n"+
		"This eye shoots forth! how big imagination\n"+
		"Moves in this lip! to the dumbness of the gesture\n"+
		"One might interpret.\n"+
		"Painter\n"+
		"It is a pretty mocking of the life.\n"+
		"Here is a touch; is't good?\n"+
		"Poet\n"+
		"I will say of it,\n"+
		"It tutors nature: artificial strife\n"+
		"Lives in these touches, livelier than life.\n"+
		"Enter certain Senators, and pass over\n"+
		"Painter\n"+
		"How this lord is follow'd!\n"+
		"Poet\n"+
		"The senators of Athens: happy man!\n"+
		"Painter\n"+
		"Look, more!\n"+
		"Poet\n"+
		"You see this confluence, this great flood\n"+
		"of visitors.\n"+
		"I have, in this rough work, shaped out a man,\n"+
		"Whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug\n"+
		"With amplest entertainment: my free drift\n"+
		"Halts not particularly, but moves itself\n"+
		"In a wide sea of wax: no levell'd malice\n"+
		"Infects one comma in the course I hold;\n"+
		"But flies an eagle flight, bold and forth on,\n"+
		"Leaving no tract behind.\n"+
		"Painter\n"+
		"How shall I understand you?\n"+
		"Poet\n"+
		"I will unbolt to you.\n"+
		"You see how all conditions, how all minds,\n"+
		"As well of glib and slippery creatures as\n"+
		"Of grave and austere quality, tender down\n"+
		"Their services to Lord Timon: his large fortune\n"+
		"Upon his good and gracious nature hanging\n"+
		"Subdues and properties to his love and tendance\n"+
		"All sorts of hearts; yea, from the glass-faced flatterer\n"+
		"To Apemantus, that few things loves better\n"+
		"Than to abhor himself: even he drops down\n"+
		"The knee before him, and returns in peace\n"+
		"Most rich in Timon's nod.\n"+
		"Painter\n"+
		"I saw them speak together.\n"+
		"Poet\n"+
		"Sir, I have upon a high and pleasant hill\n"+
		"Feign'd Fortune to be throned: the base o' the mount\n"+
		"Is rank'd with all deserts, all kind of natures,\n"+
		"That labour on the bosom of this sphere\n"+
		"To propagate their states: amongst them all,\n"+
		"Whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fix'd,\n"+
		"One do I personate of Lord Timon's frame,\n"+
		"Whom Fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her;\n"+
		"Whose present grace to present slaves and servants\n"+
		"Translates his rivals.\n"+
		"Painter\n"+
		"'Tis conceived to scope.\n"+
		"This throne, this Fortune, and this hill, methinks,\n"+
		"With one man beckon'd from the rest below,\n"+
		"Bowing his head against the sleepy mount\n"+
		"To climb his happiness, would be well express'd\n"+
		"In our condition.\n"+
		"Poet\n"+
		"Nay, sir, but hear me on.\n"+
		"All those which were his fellows but of late,\n"+
		"Some better than his value, on the moment\n"+
		"Follow his strides, his lobbies fill with tendance,\n"+
		"Rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear,\n"+
		"Make sacred even his stirrup, and through him\n"+
		"Drink the free air.\n"+
		"Painter\n"+
		"Ay, marry, what of these?\n"+
		"Poet\n"+
		"When Fortune in her shift and change of mood\n"+
		"Spurns down her late beloved, all his dependants\n"+
		"Which labour'd after him to the mountain's top\n"+
		"Even on their knees and hands, let him slip down,\n"+
		"Not one accompanying his declining foot.\n"+
		"Painter\n"+
		"'Tis common:\n"+
		"A thousand moral paintings I can show\n"+
		"That shall demonstrate these quick blows of Fortune's\n"+
		"More pregnantly than words. Yet you do well\n"+
		"To show Lord Timon that mean eyes have seen\n"+
		"The foot above the head.\n"+
		"Trumpets sound. Enter TIMON, addressing himself courteously to every suitor; a Messenger from VENTIDIUS talking with him; LUCILIUS and other servants following\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Imprison'd is he, say you?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Ay, my good lord: five talents is his debt,\n"+
		"His means most short, his creditors most strait:\n"+
		"Your honourable letter he desires\n"+
		"To those have shut him up; which failing,\n"+
		"Periods his comfort.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Noble Ventidius! Well;\n"+
		"I am not of that feather to shake off\n"+
		"My friend when he must need me. I do know him\n"+
		"A gentleman that well deserves a help:\n"+
		"Which he shall have: I'll pay the debt,\n"+
		"and free him.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Your lordship ever binds him.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Commend me to him: I will send his ransom;\n"+
		"And being enfranchised, bid him come to me.\n"+
		"'Tis not enough to help the feeble up,\n"+
		"But to support him after. Fare you well.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"All happiness to your honour!\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"Enter an old Athenian\n"+
		"Old Athenian\n"+
		"Lord Timon, hear me speak.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Freely, good father.\n"+
		"Old Athenian\n"+
		"Thou hast a servant named Lucilius.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"I have so: what of him?\n"+
		"Old Athenian\n"+
		"Most noble Timon, call the man before thee.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Attends he here, or no? Lucilius!\n"+
		"LUCILIUS\n"+
		"Here, at your lordship's service.\n"+
		"Old Athenian\n"+
		"This fellow here, Lord Timon, this thy creature,\n"+
		"By night frequents my house. I am a man\n"+
		"That from my first have been inclined to thrift;\n"+
		"And my estate deserves an heir more raised\n"+
		"Than one which holds a trencher.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Well; what further?\n"+
		"Old Athenian\n"+
		"One only daughter have I, no kin else,\n"+
		"On whom I may confer what I have got:\n"+
		"The maid is fair, o' the youngest for a bride,\n"+
		"And I have bred her at my dearest cost\n"+
		"In qualities of the best. This man of thine\n"+
		"Attempts her love: I prithee, noble lord,\n"+
		"Join with me to forbid him her resort;\n"+
		"Myself have spoke in vain.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"The man is honest.\n"+
		"Old Athenian\n"+
		"Therefore he will be, Timon:\n"+
		"His honesty rewards him in itself;\n"+
		"It must not bear my daughter.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Does she love him?\n"+
		"Old Athenian\n"+
		"She is young and apt:\n"+
		"Our own precedent passions do instruct us\n"+
		"What levity's in youth.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"[To LUCILIUS] Love you the maid?\n"+
		"LUCILIUS\n"+
		"Ay, my good lord, and she accepts of it.\n"+
		"Old Athenian\n"+
		"If in her marriage my consent be missing,\n"+
		"I call the gods to witness, I will choose\n"+
		"Mine heir from forth the beggars of the world,\n"+
		"And dispossess her all.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"How shall she be endow'd,\n"+
		"if she be mated with an equal husband?\n"+
		"Old Athenian\n"+
		"Three talents on the present; in future, all.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"This gentleman of mine hath served me long:\n"+
		"To build his fortune I will strain a little,\n"+
		"For 'tis a bond in men. Give him thy daughter:\n"+
		"What you bestow, in him I'll counterpoise,\n"+
		"And make him weigh with her.\n"+
		"Old Athenian\n"+
		"Most noble lord,\n"+
		"Pawn me to this your honour, she is his.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"My hand to thee; mine honour on my promise.\n"+
		"LUCILIUS\n"+
		"Humbly I thank your lordship: never may\n"+
		"The state or fortune fall into my keeping,\n"+
		"Which is not owed to you!\n"+
		"Exeunt LUCILIUS and Old Athenian\n"+
		"Poet\n"+
		"Vouchsafe my labour, and long live your lordship!\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"I thank you; you shall hear from me anon:\n"+
		"Go not away. What have you there, my friend?\n"+
		"Painter\n"+
		"A piece of painting, which I do beseech\n"+
		"Your lordship to accept.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Painting is welcome.\n"+
		"The painting is almost the natural man;\n"+
		"or since dishonour traffics with man's nature,\n"+
		"He is but outside: these pencill'd figures are\n"+
		"Even such as they give out. I like your work;\n"+
		"And you shall find I like it: wait attendance\n"+
		"Till you hear further from me.\n"+
		"Painter\n"+
		"The gods preserve ye!\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Well fare you, gentleman: give me your hand;\n"+
		"We must needs dine together. Sir, your jewel\n"+
		"Hath suffer'd under praise.\n"+
		"Jeweller\n"+
		"What, my lord! dispraise?\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"A more satiety of commendations.\n"+
		"If I should pay you for't as 'tis extoll'd,\n"+
		"It would unclew me quite.\n"+
		"Jeweller\n"+
		"My lord, 'tis rated\n"+
		"As those which sell would give: but you well know,\n"+
		"Things of like value differing in the owners\n"+
		"Are prized by their masters: believe't, dear lord,\n"+
		"You mend the jewel by the wearing it.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Well mock'd.\n"+
		"Merchant\n"+
		"No, my good lord; he speaks the common tongue,\n"+
		"Which all men speak with him.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Look, who comes here: will you be chid?\n"+
		"Enter APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Jeweller: We'll bear, with your lordship.\n"+
		"Merchant\n"+
		"He'll spare none.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Good morrow to thee, gentle Apemantus!\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Till I be gentle, stay thou for thy good morrow;\n"+
		"When thou art Timon's dog, and these knaves honest.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Why dost thou call them knaves? thou know'st them not.\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Are they not Athenians?\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Yes.\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Then I repent not.\n"+
		"Jeweller: You know me, Apemantus?\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Thou know'st I do: I call'd thee by thy name.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Thou art proud, Apemantus.\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Of nothing so much as that I am not like Timon.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Whither art going?\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"To knock out an honest Athenian's brains.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"That's a deed thou'lt die for.\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Right, if doing nothing be death by the law.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"How likest thou this picture, Apemantus?\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"The best, for the innocence.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Wrought he not well that painted it?\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"He wrought better that made the painter; and yet\n"+
		"he's but a filthy piece of work.\n"+
		"Painter\n"+
		"You're a dog.\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Thy mother's of my generation: what's she, if I be a dog?\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Wilt dine with me, Apemantus?\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"No; I eat not lords.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"An thou shouldst, thou 'ldst anger ladies.\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"O, they eat lords; so they come by great bellies.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"That's a lascivious apprehension.\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"So thou apprehendest it: take it for thy labour.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"How dost thou like this jewel, Apemantus?\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Not so well as plain-dealing, which will not cost a\n"+
		"man a doit.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"What dost thou think 'tis worth?\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Not worth my thinking. How now, poet!\n"+
		"Poet\n"+
		"How now, philosopher!\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Thou liest.\n"+
		"Poet\n"+
		"Art not one?\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Yes.\n"+
		"Poet\n"+
		"Then I lie not.\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Art not a poet?\n"+
		"Poet\n"+
		"Yes.\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Then thou liest: look in thy last work, where thou\n"+
		"hast feigned him a worthy fellow.\n"+
		"Poet\n"+
		"That's not feigned; he is so.\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Yes, he is worthy of thee, and to pay thee for thy\n"+
		"labour: he that loves to be flattered is worthy o'\n"+
		"the flatterer. Heavens, that I were a lord!\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"What wouldst do then, Apemantus?\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"E'en as Apemantus does now; hate a lord with my heart.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"What, thyself?\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Ay.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Wherefore?\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"That I had no angry wit to be a lord.\n"+
		"Art not thou a merchant?\n"+
		"Merchant\n"+
		"Ay, Apemantus.\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Traffic confound thee, if the gods will not!\n"+
		"Merchant\n"+
		"If traffic do it, the gods do it.\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Traffic's thy god; and thy god confound thee!\n"+
		"Trumpet sounds. Enter a Messenger\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"What trumpet's that?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"'Tis Alcibiades, and some twenty horse,\n"+
		"All of companionship.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Pray, entertain them; give them guide to us.\n"+
		"Exeunt some Attendants\n"+
		"You must needs dine with me: go not you hence\n"+
		"Till I have thank'd you: when dinner's done,\n"+
		"Show me this piece. I am joyful of your sights.\n"+
		"Enter ALCIBIADES, with the rest\n"+
		"Most welcome, sir!\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"So, so, there!\n"+
		"Aches contract and starve your supple joints!\n"+
		"That there should be small love 'mongst these\n"+
		"sweet knaves,\n"+
		"And all this courtesy! The strain of man's bred out\n"+
		"Into baboon and monkey.\n"+
		"ALCIBIADES\n"+
		"Sir, you have saved my longing, and I feed\n"+
		"Most hungerly on your sight.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Right welcome, sir!\n"+
		"Ere we depart, we'll share a bounteous time\n"+
		"In different pleasures. Pray you, let us in.\n"+
		"Exeunt all except APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Enter two Lords\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"What time o' day is't, Apemantus?\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Time to be honest.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"That time serves still.\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"The more accursed thou, that still omitt'st it.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"Thou art going to Lord Timon's feast?\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Ay, to see meat fill knaves and wine heat fools.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"Fare thee well, fare thee well.\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"Why, Apemantus?\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Shouldst have kept one to thyself, for I mean to\n"+
		"give thee none.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"Hang thyself!\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"No, I will do nothing at thy bidding: make thy\n"+
		"requests to thy friend.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"Away, unpeaceable dog, or I'll spurn thee hence!\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"I will fly, like a dog, the heels o' the ass.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"He's opposite to humanity. Come, shall we in,\n"+
		"And taste Lord Timon's bounty? he outgoes\n"+
		"The very heart of kindness.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"He pours it out; Plutus, the god of gold,\n"+
		"Is but his steward: no meed, but he repays\n"+
		"Sevenfold above itself; no gift to him,\n"+
		"But breeds the giver a return exceeding\n"+
		"All use of quittance.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"The noblest mind he carries\n"+
		"That ever govern'd man.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"Long may he live in fortunes! Shall we in?\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"I'll keep you company.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. A banqueting-room in Timon's house.\n"+
		"Hautboys playing loud music. A great banquet served in; FLAVIUS and others attending; then enter TIMON, ALCIBIADES, Lords, Senators, and VENTIDIUS. Then comes, dropping, after all, APEMANTUS, discontentedly, like himself\n"+
		"VENTIDIUS\n"+
		"Most honour'd Timon,\n"+
		"It hath pleased the gods to remember my father's age,\n"+
		"And call him to long peace.\n"+
		"He is gone happy, and has left me rich:\n"+
		"Then, as in grateful virtue I am bound\n"+
		"To your free heart, I do return those talents,\n"+
		"Doubled with thanks and service, from whose help\n"+
		"I derived liberty.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"O, by no means,\n"+
		"Honest Ventidius; you mistake my love:\n"+
		"I gave it freely ever; and there's none\n"+
		"Can truly say he gives, if he receives:\n"+
		"If our betters play at that game, we must not dare\n"+
		"To imitate them; faults that are rich are fair.\n"+
		"VENTIDIUS\n"+
		"A noble spirit!\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Nay, my lords,\n"+
		"They all stand ceremoniously looking on TIMON\n"+
		"Ceremony was but devised at first\n"+
		"To set a gloss on faint deeds, hollow welcomes,\n"+
		"Recanting goodness, sorry ere 'tis shown;\n"+
		"But where there is true friendship, there needs none.\n"+
		"Pray, sit; more welcome are ye to my fortunes\n"+
		"Than my fortunes to me.\n"+
		"They sit\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"My lord, we always have confess'd it.\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Ho, ho, confess'd it! hang'd it, have you not?\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"O, Apemantus, you are welcome.\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"No;\n"+
		"You shall not make me welcome:\n"+
		"I come to have thee thrust me out of doors.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Fie, thou'rt a churl; ye've got a humour there\n"+
		"Does not become a man: 'tis much to blame.\n"+
		"They say, my lords, 'ira furor brevis est;' but yond\n"+
		"man is ever angry. Go, let him have a table by\n"+
		"himself, for he does neither affect company, nor is\n"+
		"he fit for't, indeed.\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Let me stay at thine apperil, Timon: I come to\n"+
		"observe; I give thee warning on't.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"I take no heed of thee; thou'rt an Athenian,\n"+
		"therefore welcome: I myself would have no power;\n"+
		"prithee, let my meat make thee silent.\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"I scorn thy meat; 'twould choke me, for I should\n"+
		"ne'er flatter thee. O you gods, what a number of\n"+
		"men eat Timon, and he sees 'em not! It grieves me\n"+
		"to see so many dip their meat in one man's blood;\n"+
		"and all the madness is, he cheers them up too.\n"+
		"I wonder men dare trust themselves with men:\n"+
		"Methinks they should invite them without knives;\n"+
		"Good for their meat, and safer for their lives.\n"+
		"There's much example for't; the fellow that sits\n"+
		"next him now, parts bread with him, pledges the\n"+
		"breath of him in a divided draught, is the readiest\n"+
		"man to kill him: 't has been proved. If I were a\n"+
		"huge man, I should fear to drink at meals;\n"+
		"Lest they should spy my windpipe's dangerous notes:\n"+
		"Great men should drink with harness on their throats.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"My lord, in heart; and let the health go round.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"Let it flow this way, my good lord.\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Flow this way! A brave fellow! he keeps his tides\n"+
		"well. Those healths will make thee and thy state\n"+
		"look ill, Timon. Here's that which is too weak to\n"+
		"be a sinner, honest water, which ne'er left man i' the mire:\n"+
		"This and my food are equals; there's no odds:\n"+
		"Feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods.\n"+
		"Apemantus' grace.\n"+
		"Immortal gods, I crave no pelf;\n"+
		"I pray for no man but myself:\n"+
		"Grant I may never prove so fond,\n"+
		"To trust man on his oath or bond;\n"+
		"Or a harlot, for her weeping;\n"+
		"Or a dog, that seems a-sleeping:\n"+
		"Or a keeper with my freedom;\n"+
		"Or my friends, if I should need 'em.\n"+
		"Amen. So fall to't:\n"+
		"Rich men sin, and I eat root.\n"+
		"Eats and drinks\n"+
		"Much good dich thy good heart, Apemantus!\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Captain Alcibiades, your heart's in the field now.\n"+
		"ALCIBIADES\n"+
		"My heart is ever at your service, my lord.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"You had rather be at a breakfast of enemies than a\n"+
		"dinner of friends.\n"+
		"ALCIBIADES\n"+
		"So the were bleeding-new, my lord, there's no meat\n"+
		"like 'em: I could wish my best friend at such a feast.\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Would all those fatterers were thine enemies then,\n"+
		"that then thou mightst kill 'em and bid me to 'em!\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"Might we but have that happiness, my lord, that you\n"+
		"would once use our hearts, whereby we might express\n"+
		"some part of our zeals, we should think ourselves\n"+
		"for ever perfect.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"O, no doubt, my good friends, but the gods\n"+
		"themselves have provided that I shall have much help\n"+
		"from you: how had you been my friends else? why\n"+
		"have you that charitable title from thousands, did\n"+
		"not you chiefly belong to my heart? I have told\n"+
		"more of you to myself than you can with modesty\n"+
		"speak in your own behalf; and thus far I confirm\n"+
		"you. O you gods, think I, what need we have any\n"+
		"friends, if we should ne'er have need of 'em? they\n"+
		"were the most needless creatures living, should we\n"+
		"ne'er have use for 'em, and would most resemble\n"+
		"sweet instruments hung up in cases that keep their\n"+
		"sounds to themselves. Why, I have often wished\n"+
		"myself poorer, that I might come nearer to you. We\n"+
		"are born to do benefits: and what better or\n"+
		"properer can we can our own than the riches of our\n"+
		"friends? O, what a precious comfort 'tis, to have\n"+
		"so many, like brothers, commanding one another's\n"+
		"fortunes! O joy, e'en made away ere 't can be born!\n"+
		"Mine eyes cannot hold out water, methinks: to\n"+
		"forget their faults, I drink to you.\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Thou weepest to make them drink, Timon.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"Joy had the like conception in our eyes\n"+
		"And at that instant like a babe sprung up.\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Ho, ho! I laugh to think that babe a bastard.\n"+
		"Third Lord\n"+
		"I promise you, my lord, you moved me much.\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Much!\n"+
		"Tucket, within\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"What means that trump?\n"+
		"Enter a Servant\n"+
		"How now?\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"Please you, my lord, there are certain\n"+
		"ladies most desirous of admittance.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Ladies! what are their wills?\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"There comes with them a forerunner, my lord, which\n"+
		"bears that office, to signify their pleasures.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"I pray, let them be admitted.\n"+
		"Enter Cupid\n"+
		"Cupid\n"+
		"Hail to thee, worthy Timon, and to all\n"+
		"That of his bounties taste! The five best senses\n"+
		"Acknowledge thee their patron; and come freely\n"+
		"To gratulate thy plenteous bosom: th' ear,\n"+
		"Taste, touch and smell, pleased from thy tale rise;\n"+
		"They only now come but to feast thine eyes.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"They're welcome all; let 'em have kind admittance:\n"+
		"Music, make their welcome!\n"+
		"Exit Cupid\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"You see, my lord, how ample you're beloved.\n"+
		"Music. Re-enter Cupid with a mask of Ladies as Amazons, with lutes in their hands, dancing and playing\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Hoy-day, what a sweep of vanity comes this way!\n"+
		"They dance! they are mad women.\n"+
		"Like madness is the glory of this life.\n"+
		"As this pomp shows to a little oil and root.\n"+
		"We make ourselves fools, to disport ourselves;\n"+
		"And spend our flatteries, to drink those men\n"+
		"Upon whose age we void it up again,\n"+
		"With poisonous spite and envy.\n"+
		"Who lives that's not depraved or depraves?\n"+
		"Who dies, that bears not one spurn to their graves\n"+
		"Of their friends' gift?\n"+
		"I should fear those that dance before me now\n"+
		"Would one day stamp upon me: 't has been done;\n"+
		"Men shut their doors against a setting sun.\n"+
		"The Lords rise from table, with much adoring of TIMON; and to show their loves, each singles out an Amazon, and all dance, men with women, a lofty strain or two to the hautboys, and cease\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"You have done our pleasures much grace, fair ladies,\n"+
		"Set a fair fashion on our entertainment,\n"+
		"Which was not half so beautiful and kind;\n"+
		"You have added worth unto 't and lustre,\n"+
		"And entertain'd me with mine own device;\n"+
		"I am to thank you for 't.\n"+
		"First Lady\n"+
		"My lord, you take us even at the best.\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"'Faith, for the worst is filthy; and would not hold\n"+
		"taking, I doubt me.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Ladies, there is an idle banquet attends you:\n"+
		"Please you to dispose yourselves.\n"+
		"All Ladies\n"+
		"Most thankfully, my lord.\n"+
		"Exeunt Cupid and Ladies\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Flavius.\n"+
		"FLAVIUS\n"+
		"My lord?\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"The little casket bring me hither.\n"+
		"FLAVIUS\n"+
		"Yes, my lord. More jewels yet!\n"+
		"There is no crossing him in 's humour;\n"+
		"Aside\n"+
		"Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,\n"+
		"When all's spent, he 'ld be cross'd then, an he could.\n"+
		"'Tis pity bounty had not eyes behind,\n"+
		"That man might ne'er be wretched for his mind.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"Where be our men?\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"Here, my lord, in readiness.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"Our horses!\n"+
		"Re-enter FLAVIUS, with the casket\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"O my friends,\n"+
		"I have one word to say to you: look you, my good lord,\n"+
		"I must entreat you, honour me so much\n"+
		"As to advance this jewel; accept it and wear it,\n"+
		"Kind my lord.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"I am so far already in your gifts,--\n"+
		"All\n"+
		"So are we all.\n"+
		"Enter a Servant\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"My lord, there are certain nobles of the senate\n"+
		"Newly alighted, and come to visit you.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"They are fairly welcome.\n"+
		"FLAVIUS\n"+
		"I beseech your honour,\n"+
		"Vouchsafe me a word; it does concern you near.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Near! why then, another time I'll hear thee:\n"+
		"I prithee, let's be provided to show them\n"+
		"entertainment.\n"+
		"FLAVIUS\n"+
		"[Aside] I scarce know how.\n"+
		"Enter a Second Servant\n"+
		"Second Servant\n"+
		"May it please your honour, Lord Lucius,\n"+
		"Out of his free love, hath presented to you\n"+
		"Four milk-white horses, trapp'd in silver.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"I shall accept them fairly; let the presents\n"+
		"Be worthily entertain'd.\n"+
		"Enter a third Servant\n"+
		"How now! what news?\n"+
		"Third Servant\n"+
		"Please you, my lord, that honourable\n"+
		"gentleman, Lord Lucullus, entreats your company\n"+
		"to-morrow to hunt with him, and has sent your honour\n"+
		"two brace of greyhounds.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"I'll hunt with him; and let them be received,\n"+
		"Not without fair reward.\n"+
		"FLAVIUS\n"+
		"[Aside] What will this come to?\n"+
		"He commands us to provide, and give great gifts,\n"+
		"And all out of an empty coffer:\n"+
		"Nor will he know his purse, or yield me this,\n"+
		"To show him what a beggar his heart is,\n"+
		"Being of no power to make his wishes good:\n"+
		"His promises fly so beyond his state\n"+
		"That what he speaks is all in debt; he owes\n"+
		"For every word: he is so kind that he now\n"+
		"Pays interest for 't; his land's put to their books.\n"+
		"Well, would I were gently put out of office\n"+
		"Before I were forced out!\n"+
		"Happier is he that has no friend to feed\n"+
		"Than such that do e'en enemies exceed.\n"+
		"I bleed inwardly for my lord.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"You do yourselves\n"+
		"Much wrong, you bate too much of your own merits:\n"+
		"Here, my lord, a trifle of our love.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"With more than common thanks I will receive it.\n"+
		"Third Lord\n"+
		"O, he's the very soul of bounty!\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"And now I remember, my lord, you gave\n"+
		"Good words the other day of a bay courser\n"+
		"I rode on: it is yours, because you liked it.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"O, I beseech you, pardon me, my lord, in that.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"You may take my word, my lord; I know, no man\n"+
		"Can justly praise but what he does affect:\n"+
		"I weigh my friend's affection with mine own;\n"+
		"I'll tell you true. I'll call to you.\n"+
		"All Lords\n"+
		"O, none so welcome.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"I take all and your several visitations\n"+
		"So kind to heart, 'tis not enough to give;\n"+
		"Methinks, I could deal kingdoms to my friends,\n"+
		"And ne'er be weary. Alcibiades,\n"+
		"Thou art a soldier, therefore seldom rich;\n"+
		"It comes in charity to thee: for all thy living\n"+
		"Is 'mongst the dead, and all the lands thou hast\n"+
		"Lie in a pitch'd field.\n"+
		"ALCIBIADES\n"+
		"Ay, defiled land, my lord.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"We are so virtuously bound--\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"And so\n"+
		"Am I to you.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"So infinitely endear'd--\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"All to you. Lights, more lights!\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"The best of happiness,\n"+
		"Honour and fortunes, keep with you, Lord Timon!\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Ready for his friends.\n"+
		"Exeunt all but APEMANTUS and TIMON\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"What a coil's here!\n"+
		"Serving of becks and jutting-out of bums!\n"+
		"I doubt whether their legs be worth the sums\n"+
		"That are given for 'em. Friendship's full of dregs:\n"+
		"Methinks, false hearts should never have sound legs,\n"+
		"Thus honest fools lay out their wealth on court'sies.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Now, Apemantus, if thou wert not sullen, I would be\n"+
		"good to thee.\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"No, I'll nothing: for if I should be bribed too,\n"+
		"there would be none left to rail upon thee, and then\n"+
		"thou wouldst sin the faster. Thou givest so long,\n"+
		"Timon, I fear me thou wilt give away thyself in\n"+
		"paper shortly: what need these feasts, pomps and\n"+
		"vain-glories?\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Nay, an you begin to rail on society once, I am\n"+
		"sworn not to give regard to you. Farewell; and come\n"+
		"with better music.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"So:\n"+
		"Thou wilt not hear me now; thou shalt not then:\n"+
		"I'll lock thy heaven from thee.\n"+
		"O, that men's ears should be\n"+
		"To counsel deaf, but not to flattery!\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"ACT II\n"+
		"SCENE I. A Senator's house.\n"+
		"Enter Senator, with papers in his hand\n"+
		"Senator\n"+
		"And late, five thousand: to Varro and to Isidore\n"+
		"He owes nine thousand; besides my former sum,\n"+
		"Which makes it five and twenty. Still in motion\n"+
		"Of raging waste? It cannot hold; it will not.\n"+
		"If I want gold, steal but a beggar's dog,\n"+
		"And give it Timon, why, the dog coins gold.\n"+
		"If I would sell my horse, and buy twenty more\n"+
		"Better than he, why, give my horse to Timon,\n"+
		"Ask nothing, give it him, it foals me, straight,\n"+
		"And able horses. No porter at his gate,\n"+
		"But rather one that smiles and still invites\n"+
		"All that pass by. It cannot hold: no reason\n"+
		"Can found his state in safety. Caphis, ho!\n"+
		"Caphis, I say!\n"+
		"Enter CAPHIS\n"+
		"CAPHIS\n"+
		"Here, sir; what is your pleasure?\n"+
		"Senator\n"+
		"Get on your cloak, and haste you to Lord Timon;\n"+
		"Importune him for my moneys; be not ceased\n"+
		"With slight denial, nor then silenced when--\n"+
		"'Commend me to your master'--and the cap\n"+
		"Plays in the right hand, thus: but tell him,\n"+
		"My uses cry to me, I must serve my turn\n"+
		"Out of mine own; his days and times are past\n"+
		"And my reliances on his fracted dates\n"+
		"Have smit my credit: I love and honour him,\n"+
		"But must not break my back to heal his finger;\n"+
		"Immediate are my needs, and my relief\n"+
		"Must not be toss'd and turn'd to me in words,\n"+
		"But find supply immediate. Get you gone:\n"+
		"Put on a most importunate aspect,\n"+
		"A visage of demand; for, I do fear,\n"+
		"When every feather sticks in his own wing,\n"+
		"Lord Timon will be left a naked gull,\n"+
		"Which flashes now a phoenix. Get you gone.\n"+
		"CAPHIS\n"+
		"I go, sir.\n"+
		"Senator\n"+
		"'I go, sir!'--Take the bonds along with you,\n"+
		"And have the dates in contempt.\n"+
		"CAPHIS\n"+
		"I will, sir.\n"+
		"Senator\n"+
		"Go.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. The same. A hall in Timon's house.\n"+
		"Enter FLAVIUS, with many bills in his hand\n"+
		"FLAVIUS\n"+
		"No care, no stop! so senseless of expense,\n"+
		"That he will neither know how to maintain it,\n"+
		"Nor cease his flow of riot: takes no account\n"+
		"How things go from him, nor resumes no care\n"+
		"Of what is to continue: never mind\n"+
		"Was to be so unwise, to be so kind.\n"+
		"What shall be done? he will not hear, till feel:\n"+
		"I must be round with him, now he comes from hunting.\n"+
		"Fie, fie, fie, fie!\n"+
		"Enter CAPHIS, and the Servants of Isidore and Varro\n"+
		"CAPHIS\n"+
		"Good even, Varro: what,\n"+
		"You come for money?\n"+
		"Varro's Servant Is't not your business too?\n"+
		"CAPHIS\n"+
		"It is: and yours too, Isidore?\n"+
		"Isidore's Servant It is so.\n"+
		"CAPHIS\n"+
		"Would we were all discharged!\n"+
		"Varro's Servant I fear it.\n"+
		"CAPHIS\n"+
		"Here comes the lord.\n"+
		"Enter TIMON, ALCIBIADES, and Lords, & c\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"So soon as dinner's done, we'll forth again,\n"+
		"My Alcibiades. With me? what is your will?\n"+
		"CAPHIS\n"+
		"My lord, here is a note of certain dues.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Dues! Whence are you?\n"+
		"CAPHIS\n"+
		"Of Athens here, my lord.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Go to my steward.\n"+
		"CAPHIS\n"+
		"Please it your lordship, he hath put me off\n"+
		"To the succession of new days this month:\n"+
		"My master is awaked by great occasion\n"+
		"To call upon his own, and humbly prays you\n"+
		"That with your other noble parts you'll suit\n"+
		"In giving him his right.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Mine honest friend,\n"+
		"I prithee, but repair to me next morning.\n"+
		"CAPHIS\n"+
		"Nay, good my lord,--\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Contain thyself, good friend.\n"+
		"Varro's Servant One Varro's servant, my good lord,--\n"+
		"Isidore's Servant From Isidore;\n"+
		"He humbly prays your speedy payment.\n"+
		"CAPHIS\n"+
		"If you did know, my lord, my master's wants--\n"+
		"Varro's Servant 'Twas due on forfeiture, my lord, six weeks And past.\n"+
		"Isidore's Servant Your steward puts me off, my lord;\n"+
		"And I am sent expressly to your lordship.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Give me breath.\n"+
		"I do beseech you, good my lords, keep on;\n"+
		"I'll wait upon you instantly.\n"+
		"Exeunt ALCIBIADES and Lords\n"+
		"To FLAVIUS\n"+
		"Come hither: pray you,\n"+
		"How goes the world, that I am thus encounter'd\n"+
		"With clamourous demands of date-broke bonds,\n"+
		"And the detention of long-since-due debts,\n"+
		"Against my honour?\n"+
		"FLAVIUS\n"+
		"Please you, gentlemen,\n"+
		"The time is unagreeable to this business:\n"+
		"Your importunacy cease till after dinner,\n"+
		"That I may make his lordship understand\n"+
		"Wherefore you are not paid.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Do so, my friends. See them well entertain'd.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"FLAVIUS\n"+
		"Pray, draw near.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"Enter APEMANTUS and Fool\n"+
		"CAPHIS\n"+
		"Stay, stay, here comes the fool with Apemantus:\n"+
		"let's ha' some sport with 'em.\n"+
		"Varro's Servant Hang him, he'll abuse us.\n"+
		"Isidore's Servant A plague upon him, dog!\n"+
		"Varro's Servant How dost, fool?\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Dost dialogue with thy shadow?\n"+
		"Varro's Servant I speak not to thee.\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"No,'tis to thyself.\n"+
		"To the Fool\n"+
		"Come away.\n"+
		"Isidore's Servant There's the fool hangs on your back already.\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"No, thou stand'st single, thou'rt not on him yet.\n"+
		"CAPHIS\n"+
		"Where's the fool now?\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"He last asked the question. Poor rogues, and\n"+
		"usurers' men! bawds between gold and want!\n"+
		"All Servants\n"+
		"What are we, Apemantus?\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Asses.\n"+
		"All Servants\n"+
		"Why?\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"That you ask me what you are, and do not know\n"+
		"yourselves. Speak to 'em, fool.\n"+
		"Fool\n"+
		"How do you, gentlemen?\n"+
		"All Servants\n"+
		"Gramercies, good fool: how does your mistress?\n"+
		"Fool\n"+
		"She's e'en setting on water to scald such chickens\n"+
		"as you are. Would we could see you at Corinth!\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Good! gramercy.\n"+
		"Enter Page\n"+
		"Fool\n"+
		"Look you, here comes my mistress' page.\n"+
		"Page\n"+
		"[To the Fool] Why, how now, captain! what do you\n"+
		"in this wise company? How dost thou, Apemantus?\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+

		"thee profitably.\n"+

		"No.\n"+

		"die a bawd.\n"+
		"Page\n"+
		"Thou wast whelped a dog, and thou shalt famish a\n"+

		"If Timon stay at home. You three serve three usurers?\n"+
		"All Servants\n"+
		"Ay; would they served us!\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"So would I,--as good a trick as ever hangman served thief.\n"+
		"Fool\n"+
		"Are you three usurers' men?\n"+
		"All Servants\n"+
		"Ay, fool.\n"+
		"Fool\n"+
		"I think no usurer but has a fool to his servant: my\n"+
		"mistress is one, and I am her fool. When men come\n"+
		"to borrow of your masters, they approach sadly, and\n"+
		"go away merry; but they enter my mistress' house\n"+
		"merrily, and go away sadly: the reason of this?\n"+
		"Varro's Servant I could render one.\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Do it then, that we may account thee a whoremaster\n"+
		"and a knave; which not-withstanding, thou shalt be\n"+
		"no less esteemed.\n"+
		"Varro's Servant What is a whoremaster, fool?\n"+
		"Fool\n"+
		"A fool in good clothes, and something like thee.\n"+
		"'Tis a spirit: sometime't appears like a lord;\n"+
		"sometime like a lawyer; sometime like a philosopher,\n"+
		"with two stones moe than's artificial one: he is\n"+
		"very often like a knight; and, generally, in all\n"+
		"shapes that man goes up and down in from fourscore\n"+
		"to thirteen, this spirit walks in.\n"+
		"Varro's Servant Thou art not altogether a fool.\n"+
		"Fool\n"+
		"Nor thou altogether a wise man: as much foolery as\n"+

		"That answer might have become Apemantus.\n"+
		"All Servants\n"+
		"Aside, aside; here comes Lord Timon.\n"+
		"Re-enter TIMON and FLAVIUS\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Come with me, fool, come.\n"+
		"Fool\n"+

		"Pray you, walk near: I'll speak with you anon.\n"+
		"Exeunt Servants\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"You make me marvel: wherefore ere this time\n"+
		"Had you not fully laid my state before me,\n"+
		"That I might so have rated my expense,\n"+
		"As I had leave of means?\n"+
		"FLAVIUS\n"+
		"You would not hear me,\n"+
		"At many leisures I proposed.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Go to:\n"+
		"Perchance some single vantages you took.\n"+
		"When my indispos ition put you back:\n"+
		"And that unaptness made your minister,\n"+
		"Thus to excuse yourself.\n"+
		"FLAVIUS\n"+
		"O my good lord,\n"+
		"At many times I brought in my accounts,\n"+
		"Laid them before you; you would throw them off,\n"+
		"And say, you found them in mine honesty.\n"+
		"When, for some trifling present, you have bid me\n"+
		"Return so much, I have shook my head and wept;\n"+
		"Yea, 'gainst the authority of manners, pray'd you\n"+
		"To hold your hand more close: I did endure\n"+
		"Not seldom, nor no slight cheques, when I have\n"+
		"Prompted you in the ebb of your estate\n"+
		"And your great flow of debts. My loved lord,\n"+
		"Though you hear now, too late--yet now's a time--\n"+
		"The greatest of your having lacks a half\n"+

		"You tell me true.\n"+
		"FLAVIUS\n"+
		"If you suspect my husbandry or falsehood,\n"+
		"Call me before the exactest auditors\n"+
		"And set me on the proof. So the gods bless me,\n"+
		"When all our offices have been oppress'd\n"+
		"With riotous feeders, when our vaults have wept\n"+
		"With drunken spilth of wine, when every room\n"+
		"Hath blazed with lights and bray'd with minstrelsy,\n"+
		"I have retired me to a wasteful cock,\n"+
		"And set mine eyes at flow.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+

		"FLAVIUS\n"+
		"Heavens, have I said, the bounty of this lord!\n"+
		"How many prodigal bits have slaves and peasants\n"+
		"This night englutted! Who is not Timon's?\n"+

		"Great Timon, noble, worthy, royal Timon!\n"+
		"Ah, when the means are gone that buy this praise,\n"+
		"The breath is gone whereof this praise is made:\n"+
		"Feast-won, fast-lost; one cloud of winter showers,\n"+
		"These flies are couch'd.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Come, sermon me no further:\n"+
		"No villanous bounty yet hath pass'd my heart;\n"+
		"Unwisely, not ignobly, have I given.\n"+
		"Why dost thou weep? Canst thou the conscience lack,\n"+
		"To think I shall lack friends? Secure thy heart;\n"+
		"If I would broach the vessels of my love,\n"+
		"And try the argument of hearts by borrowing,\n"+
		"Men and men's fortunes could I frankly use\n"+
		"As I can bid thee speak.\n"+
		"FLAVIUS\n"+
		"Assurance bless your thoughts!\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"And, in some sort, these wants of mine are crown'd,\n"+
		"That I account them blessings; for by these\n"+
		"Shall I try friends: you shall perceive how you\n"+
		"Mistake my fortunes; I am wealthy in my friends.\n"+
		"Within there! Flaminius! Servilius!\n"+
		"Enter FLAMINIUS, SERVILIUS, and other Servants\n"+
		"Servants\n"+
		"My lord? my lord?\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"I will dispatch you severally; you to Lord Lucius;\n"+
		"to Lord Lucullus you: I hunted with his honour\n"+
		"to-day: you, to Sempronius: commend me to their\n"+
		"loves, and, I am proud, say, that my occasions have\n"+
		"found time to use 'em toward a supply of money: let\n"+
		"the request be fifty talents.\n"+
		"FLAMINIUS\n"+
		"As you have said, my lord.\n"+
		"FLAVIUS\n"+
		"[Aside] Lord Lucius and Lucullus? hum!\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Go you, sir, to the senators--\n"+
		"Of whom, even to the state's best health, I have\n"+
		"Deserved this hearing--bid 'em send o' the instant\n"+
		"A thousand talents to me.\n"+
		"FLAVIUS\n"+
		"I have been bold--\n"+
		"For that I knew it the most general way--\n"+
		"To them to use your signet and your name;\n"+
		"But they do shake their heads, and I am here\n"+
		"No richer in return.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Is't true? can't be?\n"+
		"FLAVIUS\n"+
		"They answer, in a joint and corporate voice,\n"+
		"That now they are at fall, want treasure, cannot\n"+
		"Do what they would; are sorry--you are honourable,--\n"+
		"But yet they could have wish'd--they know not--\n"+
		"Something hath been amiss--a noble nature\n"+
		"May catch a wrench--would all were well--'tis pity;--\n"+
		"And so, intending other serious matters,\n"+
		"After distasteful looks and these hard fractions,\n"+
		"With certain half-caps and cold-moving nods\n"+
		"They froze me into silence.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"You gods, reward them!\n"+
		"Prithee, man, look cheerly. These old fellows\n"+
		"Have their ingratitude in them hereditary:\n"+
		"Their blood is caked, 'tis cold, it seldom flows;\n"+
		"'Tis lack of kindly warmth they are not kind;\n"+
		"And nature, as it grows again toward earth,\n"+
		"Is fashion'd for the journey, dull and heavy.\n"+
		"To a Servant\n"+
		"Go to Ventidius.\n"+
		"To FLAVIUS\n"+
		"Prithee, be not sad,\n"+
		"Thou art true and honest; ingeniously I speak.\n"+
		"No blame belongs to thee.\n"+
		"To Servant\n"+
		"Ventidius lately\n"+
		"Buried his father; by whose death he's stepp'd\n"+
		"Into a great estate: when he was poor,\n"+
		"Imprison'd and in scarcity of friends,\n"+

		"Bid him suppose some good necessity\n"+
		"Touches his friend, which craves to be remember'd\n"+
		"With those five talents.\n"+
		"Exit Servant\n"+
		"To FLAVIUS\n"+
		"That had, give't these fellows\n"+
		"To whom 'tis instant due. Ne'er speak, or think,\n"+
		"That Timon's fortunes 'mong his friends can sink.\n"+
		"FLAVIUS\n"+
		"I would I could not think it: that thought is\n"+
		"bounty's foe;\n"+
		"Being free itself, it thinks all others so.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT III\n"+
		"SCENE I. A room in Lucullus' house.\n"+
		"FLAMINIUS waiting. Enter a Servant to him\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"I have told my lord of you; he is coming down to you.\n"+
		"FLAMINIUS\n"+
		"I thank you, sir.\n"+
		"Enter LUCULLUS\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"Here's my lord.\n"+
		"LUCULLUS\n"+
		"[Aside] One of Lord Timon's men? a gift, I\n"+
		"warrant. Why, this hits right; I dreamt of a silver\n"+
		"basin and ewer to-night. Flaminius, honest\n"+
		"Flaminius; you are very respectively welcome, sir.\n"+
		"Fill me some wine.\n"+
		"Exit Servants\n"+
		"And how does that honourable, complete, free-hearted\n"+
		"gentleman of Athens, thy very bountiful good lord\n"+
		"and master?\n"+
		"FLAMINIUS\n"+
		"His health is well sir.\n"+
		"LUCULLUS\n"+
		"I am right glad that his health is well, sir: and\n"+
		"what hast thou there under thy cloak, pretty Flaminius?\n"+
		"FLAMINIUS\n"+
		"'Faith, nothing but an empty box, sir; which, in my\n"+
		"lord's behalf, I come to entreat your honour to\n"+
		"supply; who, having great and instant occasion to\n"+
		"use fifty talents, hath sent to your lordship to\n"+
		"furnish him, nothing doubting your present\n"+
		"assistance therein.\n"+
		"LUCULLUS\n"+
		"La, la, la, la! 'nothing doubting,' says he? Alas,\n"+
		"good lord! a noble gentleman 'tis, if he would not\n"+
		"keep so good a house. Many a time and often I ha'\n"+
		"dined with him, and told him on't, and come again to\n"+
		"supper to him, of purpose to have him spend less,\n"+
		"and yet he would embrace no counsel, take no warning\n"+
		"by my coming. Every man has his fault, and honesty\n"+
		"is his: I ha' told him on't, but I could ne'er get\n"+
		"him from't.\n"+
		"Re-enter Servant, with wine\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"Please your lordship, here is the wine.\n"+
		"LUCULLUS\n"+
		"Flaminius, I have noted thee always wise. Here's to thee.\n"+
		"FLAMINIUS\n"+
		"Your lordship speaks your pleasure.\n"+
		"LUCULLUS\n"+
		"I have observed thee always for a towardly prompt\n"+
		"spirit--give thee thy due--and one that knows what\n"+
		"belongs to reason; and canst use the time well, if\n"+
		"the time use thee well: good parts in thee.\n"+
		"To Servant\n"+
		"Get you gone, sirrah.\n"+
		"Exit Servant\n"+
		"Draw nearer, honest Flaminius. Thy lord's a\n"+
		"bountiful gentleman: but thou art wise; and thou\n"+
		"knowest well enough, although thou comest to me,\n"+
		"that this is no time to lend money, especially upon\n"+
		"bare friendship, without security. Here's three\n"+
		"solidares for thee: good boy, wink at me, and say\n"+
		"thou sawest me not. Fare thee well.\n"+
		"FLAMINIUS\n"+
		"Is't possible the world should so much differ,\n"+
		"And we alive that lived? Fly, damned baseness,\n"+
		"To him that worships thee!\n"+
		"Throwing the money back\n"+
		"LUCULLUS\n"+
		"Ha! now I see thou art a fool, and fit for thy master.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"FLAMINIUS\n"+
		"May these add to the number that may scald thee!\n"+
		"Let moulten coin be thy damnation,\n"+
		"Thou disease of a friend, and not himself!\n"+
		"Has friendship such a faint and milky heart,\n"+
		"It turns in less than two nights? O you gods,\n"+
		"I feel master's passion! this slave,\n"+
		"Unto his honour, has my lord's meat in him:\n"+
		"Why should it thrive and turn to nutriment,\n"+
		"When he is turn'd to poison?\n"+
		"O, may diseases only work upon't!\n"+
		"And, when he's sick to death, let not that part of nature\n"+
		"Which my lord paid for, be of any power\n"+
		"To expel sickness, but prolong his hour!\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE II. A public place.\n"+
		"Enter LUCILIUS, with three Strangers\n"+
		"LUCILIUS\n"+
		"Who, the Lord Timon? he is my very good friend, and\n"+
		"an honourable gentleman.\n"+
		"First Stranger\n"+
		"We know him for no less, though we are but strangers\n"+
		"to him. But I can tell you one thing, my lord, and\n"+
		"which I hear from common rumours: now Lord Timon's\n"+
		"happy hours are done and past, and his estate\n"+
		"shrinks from him.\n"+
		"LUCILIUS\n"+
		"Fie, no, do not believe it; he cannot want for money.\n"+
		"Second Stranger\n"+
		"But believe you this, my lord, that, not long ago,\n"+
		"one of his men was with the Lord Lucullus to borrow\n"+
		"so many talents, nay, urged extremely for't and\n"+
		"showed what necessity belonged to't, and yet was denied.\n"+
		"LUCILIUS\n"+
		"How!\n"+
		"Second Stranger\n"+
		"I tell you, denied, my lord.\n"+
		"LUCILIUS\n"+
		"What a strange case was that! now, before the gods,\n"+
		"I am ashamed on't. Denied that honourable man!\n"+
		"there was very little honour showed in't. For my own\n"+
		"part, I must needs confess, I have received some\n"+
		"small kindnesses from him, as money, plate, jewels\n"+
		"and such-like trifles, nothing comparing to his;\n"+
		"yet, had he mistook him and sent to me, I should\n"+
		"ne'er have denied his occasion so many talents.\n"+
		"Enter SERVILIUS\n"+
		"SERVILIUS\n"+
		"See, by good hap, yonder's my lord;\n"+
		"I have sweat to see his honour. My honoured lord,--\n"+
		"To LUCIUS\n"+
		"LUCILIUS\n"+
		"Servilius! you are kindly met, sir. Fare thee well:\n"+
		"commend me to thy honourable virtuous lord, my very\n"+
		"exquisite friend.\n"+
		"SERVILIUS\n"+
		"May it please your honour, my lord hath sent--\n"+
		"LUCILIUS\n"+
		"Ha! what has he sent? I am so much endeared to\n"+
		"that lord; he's ever sending: how shall I thank\n"+
		"him, thinkest thou? And what has he sent now?\n"+
		"SERVILIUS\n"+
		"Has only sent his present occasion now, my lord;\n"+
		"requesting your lordship to supply his instant use\n"+
		"with so many talents.\n"+
		"LUCILIUS\n"+
		"I know his lordship is but merry with me;\n"+
		"He cannot want fifty five hundred talents.\n"+
		"SERVILIUS\n"+
		"But in the mean time he wants less, my lord.\n"+
		"If his occasion were not virtuous,\n"+
		"I should not urge it half so faithfully.\n"+
		"LUCILIUS\n"+
		"Dost thou speak seriously, Servilius?\n"+
		"SERVILIUS\n"+
		"Upon my soul,'tis true, sir.\n"+
		"LUCILIUS\n"+
		"What a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myself\n"+
		"against such a good time, when I might ha' shown\n"+
		"myself honourable! how unluckily it happened, that I\n"+
		"should purchase the day before for a little part,\n"+
		"and undo a great deal of honoured! Servilius, now,\n"+
		"before the gods, I am not able to do,--the more\n"+
		"beast, I say:--I was sending to use Lord Timon\n"+
		"myself, these gentlemen can witness! but I would\n"+
		"not, for the wealth of Athens, I had done't now.\n"+
		"Commend me bountifully to his good lordship; and I\n"+
		"hope his honour will conceive the fairest of me,\n"+
		"because I have no power to be kind: and tell him\n"+
		"this from me, I count it one of my greatest\n"+
		"afflictions, say, that I cannot pleasure such an\n"+
		"honourable gentleman. Good Servilius, will you\n"+
		"befriend me so far, as to use mine own words to him?\n"+
		"SERVILIUS\n"+
		"Yes, sir, I shall.\n"+
		"LUCILIUS\n"+
		"I'll look you out a good turn, Servilius.\n"+
		"Exit SERVILIUS\n"+
		"True as you said, Timon is shrunk indeed;\n"+
		"And he that's once denied will hardly speed.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"First Stranger\n"+
		"Do you observe this, Hostilius?\n"+
		"Second Stranger\n"+
		"Ay, too well.\n"+
		"First Stranger\n"+
		"Why, this is the world's soul; and just of the\n"+
		"same piece\n"+
		"Is every flatterer's spirit. Who can call him\n"+
		"His friend that dips in the same dish? for, in\n"+
		"My knowing, Timon has been this lord's father,\n"+
		"And kept his credit with his purse,\n"+
		"Supported his estate; nay, Timon's money\n"+
		"Has paid his men their wages: he ne'er drinks,\n"+
		"But Timon's silver treads upon his lip;\n"+
		"And yet--O, see the monstrousness of man\n"+
		"When he looks out in an ungrateful shape!--\n"+
		"He does deny him, in respect of his,\n"+
		"What charitable men afford to beggars.\n"+
		"Third Stranger\n"+
		"Religion groans at it.\n"+
		"First Stranger\n"+
		"For mine own part,\n"+
		"I never tasted Timon in my life,\n"+
		"Nor came any of his bounties over me,\n"+
		"To mark me for his friend; yet, I protest,\n"+
		"For his right noble mind, illustrious virtue\n"+
		"And honourable carriage,\n"+
		"Had his necessity made use of me,\n"+
		"I would have put my wealth into donation,\n"+
		"And the best half should have return'd to him,\n"+
		"So much I love his heart: but, I perceive,\n"+
		"Men must learn now with pity to dispense;\n"+
		"For policy sits above conscience.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. A room in Sempronius' house.\n"+
		"Enter SEMPRONIUS, and a Servant of TIMON's\n"+
		"SEMPRONIUS\n"+
		"Must he needs trouble me in 't,--hum!--'bove\n"+
		"all others?\n"+
		"He might have tried Lord Lucius or Lucullus;\n"+
		"And now Ventidius is wealthy too,\n"+
		"Whom he redeem'd from prison: all these\n"+
		"Owe their estates unto him.\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"My lord,\n"+
		"They have all been touch'd and found base metal, for\n"+
		"They have au denied him.\n"+
		"SEMPRONIUS\n"+
		"How! have they denied him?\n"+
		"Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him?\n"+
		"And does he send to me? Three? hum!\n"+
		"It shows but little love or judgment in him:\n"+
		"Must I be his last refuge! His friends, like\n"+
		"physicians,\n"+
		"Thrive, give him over: must I take the cure upon me?\n"+
		"Has much disgraced me in't; I'm angry at him,\n"+
		"That might have known my place: I see no sense for't,\n"+
		"But his occasion might have woo'd me first;\n"+
		"For, in my conscience, I was the first man\n"+
		"That e'er received gift from him:\n"+
		"And does he think so backwardly of me now,\n"+
		"That I'll requite its last? No:\n"+
		"So it may prove an argument of laughter\n"+
		"To the rest, and 'mongst lords I be thought a fool.\n"+
		"I'ld rather than the worth of thrice the sum,\n"+
		"Had sent to me first, but for my mind's sake;\n"+
		"I'd such a courage to do him good. But now return,\n"+
		"And with their faint reply this answer join;\n"+
		"Who bates mine honour shall not know my coin.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"Excellent! Your lordship's a goodly villain. The\n"+
		"devil knew not what he did when he made man\n"+
		"politic; he crossed himself by 't: and I cannot\n"+
		"think but, in the end, the villainies of man will\n"+
		"set him clear. How fairly this lord strives to\n"+
		"appear foul! takes virtuous copies to be wicked,\n"+
		"like those that under hot ardent zeal would set\n"+
		"whole realms on fire: Of such a nature is his\n"+
		"politic love.\n"+
		"This was my lord's best hope; now all are fled,\n"+
		"Save only the gods: now his friends are dead,\n"+
		"Doors, that were ne'er acquainted with their wards\n"+
		"Many a bounteous year must be employ'd\n"+
		"Now to guard sure their master.\n"+
		"And this is all a liberal course allows;\n"+
		"Who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE IV. The same. A hall in Timon's house.\n"+
		"Enter two Servants of Varro, and the Servant of LUCIUS, meeting TITUS, HORTENSIUS, and other Servants of TIMON's creditors, waiting his coming out\n"+
		"Varro's\n"+
		"First Servant\n"+
		"Well met; good morrow, Titus and Hortensius.\n"+
		"TITUS\n"+
		"The like to you kind Varro.\n"+
		"HORTENSIUS\n"+
		"Lucius!\n"+
		"What, do we meet together?\n"+
		"Lucilius' Servant Ay, and I think\n"+
		"One business does command us all; for mine Is money.\n"+
		"TITUS\n"+
		"So is theirs and ours.\n"+
		"Enter PHILOTUS\n"+
		"Lucilius' Servant And Sir Philotus too!\n"+
		"PHILOTUS\n"+
		"Good day at once.\n"+
		"Lucilius' Servant Welcome, good brother.\n"+
		"What do you think the hour?\n"+
		"PHILOTUS\n"+
		"Labouring for nine.\n"+
		"Lucilius' Servant So much?\n"+
		"PHILOTUS\n"+
		"Is not my lord seen yet?\n"+
		"Lucilius' Servant Not yet.\n"+
		"PHILOTUS\n"+
		"I wonder on't; he was wont to shine at seven.\n"+
		"Lucilius' Servant Ay, but the days are wax'd shorter with him:\n"+
		"You must consider that a prodigal course\n"+
		"Is like the sun's; but not, like his, recoverable.\n"+
		"I fear 'tis deepest winter in Lord Timon's purse;\n"+
		"That is one may reach deep enough, and yet\n"+
		"Find little.\n"+
		"PHILOTUS\n"+
		"I am of your fear for that.\n"+
		"TITUS\n"+
		"I'll show you how to observe a strange event.\n"+
		"Your lord sends now for money.\n"+
		"HORTENSIUS\n"+
		"Most true, he does.\n"+
		"TITUS\n"+
		"And he wears jewels now of Timon's gift,\n"+
		"For which I wait for money.\n"+
		"HORTENSIUS\n"+
		"It is against my heart.\n"+
		"Lucilius' Servant Mark, how strange it shows,\n"+
		"Timon in this should pay more than he owes:\n"+
		"And e'en as if your lord should wear rich jewels,\n"+
		"And send for money for 'em.\n"+
		"HORTENSIUS\n"+
		"I'm weary of this charge, the gods can witness:\n"+
		"I know my lord hath spent of Timon's wealth,\n"+
		"And now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth.\n"+
		"Varro's\n"+
		"First Servant\n"+
		"Yes, mine's three thousand crowns: what's yours?\n"+
		"Lucilius' Servant Five thousand mine.\n"+
		"Varro's\n"+
		"First Servant\n"+
		"'Tis much deep: and it should seem by the sun,\n"+
		"Your master's confidence was above mine;\n"+
		"Else, surely, his had equall'd.\n"+
		"Enter FLAMINIUS.\n"+
		"TITUS\n"+
		"One of Lord Timon's men.\n"+
		"Lucilius' Servant Flaminius! Sir, a word: pray, is my lord ready to\n"+
		"come forth?\n"+
		"FLAMINIUS\n"+
		"No, indeed, he is not.\n"+
		"TITUS\n"+
		"We attend his lordship; pray, signify so much.\n"+
		"FLAMINIUS\n"+
		"I need not tell him that; he knows you are too diligent.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"Enter FLAVIUS in a cloak, muffled\n"+
		"Lucilius' Servant Ha! is not that his steward muffled so?\n"+
		"He goes away in a cloud: call him, call him.\n"+
		"TITUS\n"+
		"Do you hear, sir?\n"+
		"Varro's\n"+
		"Second Servant\n"+
		"By your leave, sir,--\n"+
		"FLAVIUS\n"+
		"What do ye ask of me, my friend?\n"+
		"TITUS\n"+
		"We wait for certain money here, sir.\n"+
		"FLAVIUS\n"+
		"Ay,\n"+
		"If money were as certain as your waiting,\n"+
		"'Twere sure enough.\n"+
		"Why then preferr'd you not your sums and bills,\n"+
		"When your false masters eat of my lord's meat?\n"+
		"Then they could smile and fawn upon his debts\n"+
		"And take down the interest into their\n"+
		"gluttonous maws.\n"+
		"You do yourselves but wrong to stir me up;\n"+
		"Let me pass quietly:\n"+
		"Believe 't, my lord and I have made an end;\n"+
		"I have no more to reckon, he to spend.\n"+
		"Lucilius' Servant Ay, but this answer will not serve.\n"+
		"FLAVIUS\n"+
		"If 'twill not serve,'tis not so base as you;\n"+
		"For you serve knaves.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"Varro's\n"+
		"First Servant\n"+
		"How! what does his cashiered worship mutter?\n"+
		"Varro's\n"+
		"Second Servant\n"+
		"No matter what; he's poor, and that's revenge\n"+
		"enough. Who can speak broader than he that has no\n"+
		"house to put his head in? such may rail against\n"+
		"great buildings.\n"+
		"Enter SERVILIUS\n"+
		"TITUS\n"+
		"O, here's Servilius; now we shall know some answer.\n"+
		"SERVILIUS\n"+
		"If I might beseech you, gentlemen, to repair some\n"+
		"other hour, I should derive much from't; for,\n"+
		"take't of my soul, my lord leans wondrously to\n"+
		"discontent: his comfortable temper has forsook him;\n"+
		"he's much out of health, and keeps his chamber.\n"+
		"Lucilius' Servant: Many do keep their chambers are not sick:\n"+
		"And, if it be so far beyond his health,\n"+
		"Methinks he should the sooner pay his debts,\n"+
		"And make a clear way to the gods.\n"+
		"SERVILIUS\n"+
		"Good gods!\n"+
		"TITUS\n"+
		"We cannot take this for answer, sir.\n"+
		"FLAMINIUS\n"+
		"[Within] Servilius, help! My lord! my lord!\n"+
		"Enter TIMON, in a rage, FLAMINIUS following\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"What, are my doors opposed against my passage?\n"+
		"Have I been ever free, and must my house\n"+
		"Be my retentive enemy, my gaol?\n"+
		"The place which I have feasted, does it now,\n"+
		"Like all mankind, show me an iron heart?\n"+
		"Lucilius' Servant Put in now, Titus.\n"+
		"TITUS\n"+
		"My lord, here is my bill.\n"+
		"Lucilius' Servant Here's mine.\n"+
		"HORTENSIUS\n"+
		"And mine, my lord.\n"+
		"Both\n"+
		"Varro's Servants And ours, my lord.\n"+
		"PHILOTUS\n"+
		"All our bills.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Knock me down with 'em: cleave me to the girdle.\n"+
		"Lucilius' Servant Alas, my lord,-\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Cut my heart in sums.\n"+
		"TITUS\n"+
		"Mine, fifty talents.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Tell out my blood.\n"+
		"Lucilius' Servant Five thousand crowns, my lord.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Five thousand drops pays that.\n"+
		"What yours?--and yours?\n"+

		"Second Servant\n"+

		"'Faith, I perceive our masters may throw their caps\n"+
		"at their money: these debts may well be called\n"+
		"desperate ones, for a madman owes 'em.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"Re-enter TIMON and FLAVIUS\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"They have e'en put my breath from me, the slaves.\n"+
		"Creditors? devils!\n"+

		"A moderate table.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Be't not in thy care; go,\n"+
		"I charge thee, invite them all: let in the tide\n"+
		"Of knaves once more; my cook and I'll provide.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE V. The same. The senate-house. The Senate sitting.\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"My lord, you have my voice to it; the fault's\n"+
		"Bloody; 'tis necessary he should die:\n"+
		"Nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy.\n"+
		"Second Senator\n"+
		"Most true; the law shall bruise him.\n"+
		"Enter ALCIBIADES, with Attendants\n"+
		"ALCIBIADES\n"+
		"Honour, health, and compassion to the senate!\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"Now, captain?\n"+
		"ALCIBIADES\n"+
		"I am an humble suitor to your virtues;\n"+
		"For pity is the virtue of the law,\n"+
		"And none but tyrants use it cruelly.\n"+
		"It pleases time and fortune to lie heavy\n"+
		"Upon a friend of mine, who, in hot blood,\n"+
		"Hath stepp'd into the law, which is past depth\n"+
		"To those that, without heed, do plunge into 't.\n"+
		"He is a man, setting his fate aside,\n"+
		"Of comely virtues:\n"+
		"Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice--\n"+
		"An honour in him which buys out his fault--\n"+
		"But with a noble fury and fair spirit,\n"+
		"Seeing his reputation touch'd to death,\n"+
		"He did oppose his foe:\n"+
		"And with such sober and unnoted passion\n"+
		"He did behave his anger, ere 'twas spent,\n"+
		"As if he had but proved an argument.\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"You undergo too strict a paradox,\n"+
		"Striving to make an ugly deed look fair:\n"+
		"Your words have took such pains as if they labour'd\n"+
		"To bring manslaughter into form and set quarrelling\n"+
		"Upon the head of valour; which indeed\n"+
		"Is valour misbegot and came into the world\n"+
		"When sects and factions were newly born:\n"+
		"He's truly valiant that can wisely suffer\n"+
		"The worst that man can breathe, and make his wrongs\n"+
		"His outsides, to wear them like his raiment,\n"+
		"carelessly,\n"+
		"And ne'er prefer his injuries to his heart,\n"+
		"To bring it into danger.\n"+
		"If wrongs be evils and enforce us kill,\n"+
		"What folly 'tis to hazard life for ill!\n"+
		"ALCIBIADES\n"+
		"My lord,--\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"You cannot make gross sins look clear:\n"+
		"To revenge is no valour, but to bear.\n"+
		"ALCIBIADES\n"+
		"My lords, then, under favour, pardon me,\n"+
		"If I speak like a captain.\n"+
		"Why do fond men expose themselves to battle,\n"+
		"And not endure all threats? sleep upon't,\n"+
		"And let the foes quietly cut their throats,\n"+
		"Without repugnancy? If there be\n"+
		"Such valour in the bearing, what make we\n"+
		"Abroad? why then, women are more valiant\n"+
		"That stay at home, if bearing carry it,\n"+
		"And the ass more captain than the lion, the felon\n"+
		"Loaden with irons wiser than the judge,\n"+
		"If wisdom be in suffering. O my lords,\n"+
		"As you are great, be pitifully good:\n"+
		"Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood?\n"+
		"To kill, I grant, is sin's extremest gust;\n"+
		"But, in defence, by mercy, 'tis most just.\n"+
		"To be in anger is impiety;\n"+
		"But who is man that is not angry?\n"+
		"Weigh but the crime with this.\n"+
		"Second Senator\n"+
		"You breathe in vain.\n"+
		"ALCIBIADES\n"+
		"In vain! his service done\n"+
		"At Lacedaemon and Byzantium\n"+
		"Were a sufficient briber for his life.\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"What's that?\n"+
		"ALCIBIADES\n"+
		"I say, my lords, he has done fair service,\n"+
		"And slain in fight many of your enemies:\n"+
		"How full of valour did he bear himself\n"+
		"In the last conflict, and made plenteous wounds!\n"+
		"Second Senator\n"+
		"He has made too much plenty with 'em;\n"+
		"He's a sworn rioter: he has a sin that often\n"+
		"Drowns him, and takes his valour prisoner:\n"+
		"If there were no foes, that were enough\n"+
		"To overcome him: in that beastly fury\n"+
		"He has been known to commit outrages,\n"+
		"And cherish factions: 'tis inferr'd to us,\n"+
		"His days are foul and his drink dangerous.\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"He dies.\n"+
		"ALCIBIADES\n"+
		"Hard fate! he might have died in war.\n"+
		"My lords, if not for any parts in him--\n"+
		"Though his right arm might purchase his own time\n"+
		"And be in debt to none--yet, more to move you,\n"+
		"Take my deserts to his, and join 'em both:\n"+
		"And, for I know your reverend ages love\n"+
		"Security, I'll pawn my victories, all\n"+
		"My honours to you, upon his good returns.\n"+
		"If by this crime he owes the law his life,\n"+
		"Why, let the war receive 't in valiant gore\n"+
		"For law is strict, and war is nothing more.\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"We are for law: he dies; urge it no more,\n"+
		"On height of our displeasure: friend or brother,\n"+
		"He forfeits his own blood that spills another.\n"+
		"ALCIBIADES\n"+
		"Must it be so? it must not be. My lords,\n"+
		"I do beseech you, know me.\n"+
		"Second Senator\n"+
		"How!\n"+
		"ALCIBIADES\n"+
		"Call me to your remembrances.\n"+
		"Third Senator\n"+
		"What!\n"+
		"ALCIBIADES\n"+
		"I cannot think but your age has forgot me;\n"+
		"It could not else be, I should prove so base,\n"+
		"To sue, and be denied such common grace:\n"+
		"My wounds ache at you.\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"Do you dare our anger?\n"+
		"'Tis in few words, but spacious in effect;\n"+
		"We banish thee for ever.\n"+
		"ALCIBIADES\n"+
		"Banish me!\n"+
		"Banish your dotage; banish usury,\n"+
		"That makes the senate ugly.\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"If, after two days' shine, Athens contain thee,\n"+
		"Attend our weightier judgment. And, not to swell\n"+
		"our spirit,\n"+
		"He shall be executed presently.\n"+
		"Exeunt Senators\n"+
		"ALCIBIADES\n"+
		"Now the gods keep you old enough; that you may live\n"+
		"Only in bone, that none may look on you!\n"+
		"I'm worse than mad: I have kept back their foes,\n"+
		"While they have told their money and let out\n"+
		"Their coin upon large interest, I myself\n"+
		"Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?\n"+
		"Is this the balsam that the usuring senate\n"+
		"Pours into captains' wounds? Banishment!\n"+
		"It comes not ill; I hate not to be banish'd;\n"+
		"It is a cause worthy my spleen and fury,\n"+
		"That I may strike at Athens. I'll cheer up\n"+
		"My discontented troops, and lay for hearts.\n"+
		"'Tis honour with most lands to be at odds;\n"+
		"Soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE VI. The same. A banqueting-room in Timon's house.\n"+
		"Music. Tables set out: Servants attending. Enter divers Lords, Senators and others, at several doors\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"The good time of day to you, sir.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"I also wish it to you. I think this honourable lord\n"+
		"did but try us this other day.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"Upon that were my thoughts tiring, when we\n"+
		"encountered: I hope it is not so low with him as\n"+
		"he made it seem in the trial of his several friends.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"It should not be, by the persuasion of his new feasting.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"I should think so: he hath sent me an earnest\n"+
		"inviting, which many my near occasions did urge me\n"+
		"to put off; but he hath conjured me beyond them, and\n"+
		"I must needs appear.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"In like manner was I in debt to my importunate\n"+
		"business, but he would not hear my excuse. I am\n"+
		"sorry, when he sent to borrow of me, that my\n"+
		"provision was out.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"I am sick of that grief too, as I understand how all\n"+
		"things go.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"Every man here's so. What would he have borrowed of\n"+
		"you?\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"A thousand pieces.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"A thousand pieces!\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"What of you?\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"He sent to me, sir,--Here he comes.\n"+
		"Enter TIMON and Attendants\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"With all my heart, gentlemen both; and how fare you?\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"Ever at the best, hearing well of your lordship.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"The swallow follows not summer more willing than we\n"+
		"your lordship.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"[Aside] Nor more willingly leaves winter; such\n"+
		"summer-birds are men. Gentlemen, our dinner will not\n"+
		"recompense this long stay: feast your ears with the\n"+
		"music awhile, if they will fare so harshly o' the\n"+
		"trumpet's sound; we shall to 't presently.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"I hope it remains not unkindly with your lordship\n"+
		"that I returned you an empty messenger.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"O, sir, let it not trouble you.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"My noble lord,--\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Ah, my good friend, what cheer?\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"My most honourable lord, I am e'en sick of shame,\n"+
		"that, when your lordship this other day sent to me,\n"+
		"I was so unfortunate a beggar.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Think not on 't, sir.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"If you had sent but two hours before,--\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Let it not cumber your better remembrance.\n"+
		"The banquet brought in\n"+
		"Come, bring in all together.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"All covered dishes!\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"Royal cheer, I warrant you.\n"+
		"Third Lord\n"+
		"Doubt not that, if money and the season can yield\n"+
		"it.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"How do you? What's the news?\n"+
		"Third Lord\n"+
		"Alcibiades is banished: hear you of it?\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"Alcibiades banished!\n"+
		"Third Lord\n"+
		"'Tis so, be sure of it.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"How! how!\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"I pray you, upon what?\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"My worthy friends, will you draw near?\n"+
		"Third Lord\n"+
		"I'll tell you more anon. Here's a noble feast toward.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"This is the old man still.\n"+
		"Third Lord\n"+
		"Will 't hold? will 't hold?\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"It does: but time will--and so--\n"+
		"Third Lord\n"+
		"I do conceive.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Each man to his stool, with that spur as he would to\n"+
		"the lip of his mistress: your diet shall be in all\n"+
		"places alike. Make not a city feast of it, to let\n"+
		"the meat cool ere we can agree upon the first place:\n"+
		"sit, sit. The gods require our thanks.\n"+
		"You great benefactors, sprinkle our society with\n"+
		"thankfulness. For your own gifts, make yourselves\n"+
		"praised: but reserve still to give, lest your\n"+
		"deities be despised. Lend to each man enough, that\n"+
		"one need not lend to another; for, were your\n"+
		"godheads to borrow of men, men would forsake the\n"+
		"gods. Make the meat be beloved more than the man\n"+
		"that gives it. Let no assembly of twenty be without\n"+
		"a score of villains: if there sit twelve women at\n"+
		"the table, let a dozen of them be--as they are. The\n"+
		"rest of your fees, O gods--the senators of Athens,\n"+
		"together with the common lag of people--what is\n"+
		"amiss in them, you gods, make suitable for\n"+
		"destruction. For these my present friends, as they\n"+
		"are to me nothing, so in nothing bless them, and to\n"+
		"nothing are they welcome.\n"+
		"Uncover, dogs, and lap.\n"+
		"The dishes are uncovered and seen to be full of warm water\n"+
		"Some Speak\n"+
		"What does his lordship mean?\n"+
		"Some Others\n"+
		"I know not.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"May you a better feast never behold,\n"+
		"You knot of mouth-friends I smoke and lukewarm water\n"+
		"Is your perfection. This is Timon's last;\n"+
		"Who, stuck and spangled with your flatteries,\n"+
		"Washes it off, and sprinkles in your faces\n"+
		"Your reeking villany.\n"+
		"Throwing the water in their faces\n"+
		"Live loathed and long,\n"+
		"Most smiling, smooth, detested parasites,\n"+
		"Courteous destroyers, affable wolves, meek bears,\n"+
		"You fools of fortune, trencher-friends, time's flies,\n"+
		"Cap and knee slaves, vapours, and minute-jacks!\n"+
		"Of man and beast the infinite malady\n"+
		"Crust you quite o'er! What, dost thou go?\n"+
		"Soft! take thy physic first--thou too--and thou;--\n"+
		"Stay, I will lend thee money, borrow none.\n"+
		"Throws the dishes at them, and drives them out\n"+
		"What, all in motion? Henceforth be no feast,\n"+
		"Whereat a villain's not a welcome guest.\n"+
		"Burn, house! sink, Athens! henceforth hated be\n"+
		"Of Timon man and all humanity!\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"Re-enter the Lords, Senators, & c\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"How now, my lords!\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"Know you the quality of Lord Timon's fury?\n"+
		"Third Lord\n"+
		"Push! did you see my cap?\n"+
		"Fourth Lord\n"+
		"I have lost my gown.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"He's but a mad lord, and nought but humour sways him.\n"+
		"He gave me a jewel th' other day, and now he has\n"+
		"beat it out of my hat: did you see my jewel?\n"+
		"Third Lord\n"+
		"Did you see my cap?\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"Here 'tis.\n"+
		"Fourth Lord\n"+
		"Here lies my gown.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"Let's make no stay.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"Lord Timon's mad.\n"+
		"Third Lord\n"+
		"I feel 't upon my bones.\n"+
		"Fourth Lord\n"+
		"One day he gives us diamonds, next day stones.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT IV\n"+
		"SCENE I. Without the walls of Athens.\n"+
		"Enter TIMON\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Let me look back upon thee. O thou wall,\n"+
		"That girdlest in those wolves, dive in the earth,\n"+
		"And fence not Athens! Matrons, turn incontinent!\n"+
		"Obedience fail in children! slaves and fools,\n"+
		"Pluck the grave wrinkled senate from the bench,\n"+
		"And minister in their steads! to general filths\n"+
		"Convert o' the instant, green virginity,\n"+
		"Do 't in your parents' eyes! bankrupts, hold fast;\n"+
		"Rather than render back, out with your knives,\n"+
		"And cut your trusters' throats! bound servants, steal!\n"+
		"Large-handed robbers your grave masters are,\n"+
		"And pill by law. Maid, to thy master's bed;\n"+
		"Thy mistress is o' the brothel! Son of sixteen,\n"+
		"pluck the lined crutch from thy old limping sire,\n"+
		"With it beat out his brains! Piety, and fear,\n"+
		"Religion to the gods, peace, justice, truth,\n"+
		"Domestic awe, night-rest, and neighbourhood,\n"+
		"Instruction, manners, mysteries, and trades,\n"+
		"Degrees, observances, customs, and laws,\n"+
		"Decline to your confounding contraries,\n"+
		"And let confusion live! Plagues, incident to men,\n"+
		"Your potent and infectious fevers heap\n"+
		"On Athens, ripe for stroke! Thou cold sciatica,\n"+
		"Cripple our senators, that their limbs may halt\n"+
		"As lamely as their manners. Lust and liberty\n"+
		"Creep in the minds and marrows of our youth,\n"+
		"That 'gainst the stream of virtue they may strive,\n"+
		"And drown themselves in riot! Itches, blains,\n"+
		"Sow all the Athenian bosoms; and their crop\n"+
		"Be general leprosy! Breath infect breath,\n"+
		"at their society, as their friendship, may\n"+
		"merely poison! Nothing I'll bear from thee,\n"+
		"But nakedness, thou detestable town!\n"+
		"Take thou that too, with multiplying bans!\n"+
		"Timon will to the woods; where he shall find\n"+
		"The unkindest beast more kinder than mankind.\n"+
		"The gods confound--hear me, you good gods all--\n"+
		"The Athenians both within and out that wall!\n"+
		"And grant, as Timon grows, his hate may grow\n"+
		"To the whole race of mankind, high and low! Amen.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE II. Athens. A room in Timon's house.\n"+
		"Enter FLAVIUS, with two or three Servants\n"+
		"First Servant\n"+
		"Hear you, master steward, where's our master?\n"+
		"Are we undone? cast off? nothing remaining?\n"+
		"FLAVIUS\n"+
		"Alack, my fellows, what should I say to you?\n"+
		"Let me be recorded by the righteous gods,\n"+
		"I am as poor as you.\n"+
		"First Servant\n"+
		"Such a house broke!\n"+
		"So noble a master fall'n! All gone! and not\n"+
		"One friend to take his fortune by the arm,\n"+
		"And go along with him!\n"+
		"Second Servant\n"+
		"As we do turn our backs\n"+
		"From our companion thrown into his grave,\n"+
		"So his familiars to his buried fortunes\n"+
		"Slink all away, leave their false vows with him,\n"+
		"Like empty purses pick'd; and his poor self,\n"+
		"A dedicated beggar to the air,\n"+
		"With his disease of all-shunn'd poverty,\n"+
		"Walks, like contempt, alone. More of our fellows.\n"+
		"Enter other Servants\n"+
		"FLAVIUS\n"+
		"All broken implements of a ruin'd house.\n"+
		"Third Servant\n"+
		"Yet do our hearts wear Timon's livery;\n"+
		"That see I by our faces; we are fellows still,\n"+
		"Serving alike in sorrow: leak'd is our bark,\n"+
		"And we, poor mates, stand on the dying deck,\n"+
		"Hearing the surges threat: we must all part\n"+
		"Into this sea of air.\n"+
		"FLAVIUS\n"+
		"Good fellows all,\n"+
		"The latest of my wealth I'll share amongst you.\n"+
		"Wherever we shall meet, for Timon's sake,\n"+
		"Let's yet be fellows; let's shake our heads, and say,\n"+
		"As 'twere a knell unto our master's fortunes,\n"+
		"'We have seen better days.' Let each take some;\n"+
		"Nay, put out all your hands. Not one word more:\n"+
		"Thus part we rich in sorrow, parting poor.\n"+
		"Servants embrace, and part several ways\n"+
		"O, the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us!\n"+
		"Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt,\n"+
		"Since riches point to misery and contempt?\n"+
		"Who would be so mock'd with glory? or to live\n"+
		"But in a dream of friendship?\n"+
		"To have his pomp and all what state compounds\n"+
		"But only painted, like his varnish'd friends?\n"+
		"Poor honest lord, brought low by his own heart,\n"+
		"Undone by goodness! Strange, unusual blood,\n"+
		"When man's worst sin is, he does too much good!\n"+
		"Who, then, dares to be half so kind again?\n"+
		"For bounty, that makes gods, does still mar men.\n"+
		"My dearest lord, bless'd, to be most accursed,\n"+
		"Rich, only to be wretched, thy great fortunes\n"+
		"Are made thy chief afflictions. Alas, kind lord!\n"+
		"He's flung in rage from this ingrateful seat\n"+
		"Of monstrous friends, nor has he with him to\n"+
		"Supply his life, or that which can command it.\n"+
		"I'll follow and inquire him out:\n"+
		"I'll ever serve his mind with my best will;\n"+
		"Whilst I have gold, I'll be his steward still.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE III. Woods and cave, near the seashore.\n"+
		"Enter TIMON, from the cave\n"+
		"O blessed breeding sun, draw from the earth\n"+
		"Rotten humidity; below thy sister's orb\n"+
		"Infect the air! Twinn'd brothers of one womb,\n"+
		"Whose procreation, residence, and birth,\n"+
		"Scarce is dividant, touch them with several fortunes;\n"+
		"The greater scorns the lesser: not nature,\n"+
		"To whom all sores lay siege, can bear great fortune,\n"+
		"But by contempt of nature.\n"+
		"Raise me this beggar, and deny 't that lord;\n"+
		"The senator shall bear contempt hereditary,\n"+
		"The beggar native honour.\n"+
		"It is the pasture lards the rother's sides,\n"+
		"The want that makes him lean. Who dares, who dares,\n"+
		"In purity of manhood stand upright,\n"+
		"And say 'This man's a flatterer?' if one be,\n"+
		"So are they all; for every grise of fortune\n"+
		"Is smooth'd by that below: the learned pate\n"+
		"Ducks to the golden fool: all is oblique;\n"+
		"There's nothing level in our cursed natures,\n"+
		"But direct villany. Therefore, be abhorr'd\n"+
		"All feasts, societies, and throngs of men!\n"+
		"His semblable, yea, himself, Timon disdains:\n"+
		"Destruction fang mankind! Earth, yield me roots!\n"+
		"Digging\n"+
		"Who seeks for better of thee, sauce his palate\n"+
		"With thy most operant poison! What is here?\n"+
		"Gold? yellow, glittering, precious gold? No, gods,\n"+
		"I am no idle votarist: roots, you clear heavens!\n"+
		"Thus much of this will make black white, foul fair,\n"+
		"Wrong right, base noble, old young, coward valiant.\n"+
		"Ha, you gods! why this? what this, you gods? Why, this\n"+
		"Will lug your priests and servants from your sides,\n"+
		"Pluck stout men's pillows from below their heads:\n"+
		"This yellow slave\n"+
		"Will knit and break religions, bless the accursed,\n"+
		"Make the hoar leprosy adored, place thieves\n"+
		"And give them title, knee and approbation\n"+
		"With senators on the bench: this is it\n"+
		"That makes the wappen'd widow wed again;\n"+
		"She, whom the spital-house and ulcerous sores\n"+
		"Would cast the gorge at, this embalms and spices\n"+
		"To the April day again. Come, damned earth,\n"+
		"Thou common whore of mankind, that put'st odds\n"+
		"Among the route of nations, I will make thee\n"+
		"Do thy right nature.\n"+
		"March afar off\n"+
		"Ha! a drum ? Thou'rt quick,\n"+
		"But yet I'll bury thee: thou'lt go, strong thief,\n"+
		"When gouty keepers of thee cannot stand.\n"+
		"Nay, stay thou out for earnest.\n"+
		"Keeping some gold\n"+
		"Enter ALCIBIADES, with drum and fife, in warlike manner; PHRYNIA and TIMANDRA\n"+
		"ALCIBIADES\n"+
		"What art thou there? speak.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"A beast, as thou art. The canker gnaw thy heart,\n"+
		"For showing me again the eyes of man!\n"+
		"ALCIBIADES\n"+
		"What is thy name? Is man so hateful to thee,\n"+
		"That art thyself a man?\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"I am Misanthropos, and hate mankind.\n"+
		"For thy part, I do wish thou wert a dog,\n"+
		"That I might love thee something.\n"+
		"ALCIBIADES\n"+
		"I know thee well;\n"+
		"But in thy fortunes am unlearn'd and strange.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"I know thee too; and more than that I know thee,\n"+
		"I not desire to know. Follow thy drum;\n"+
		"With man's blood paint the ground, gules, gules:\n"+
		"Religious canons, civil laws are cruel;\n"+
		"Then what should war be? This fell whore of thine\n"+
		"Hath in her more destruction than thy sword,\n"+
		"For all her cherubim look.\n"+
		"PHRYNIA\n"+
		"Thy lips rot off!\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"I will not kiss thee; then the rot returns\n"+
		"To thine own lips again.\n"+
		"ALCIBIADES\n"+
		"How came the noble Timon to this change?\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"As the moon does, by wanting light to give:\n"+
		"But then renew I could not, like the moon;\n"+
		"There were no suns to borrow of.\n"+
		"ALCIBIADES\n"+
		"Noble Timon,\n"+
		"What friendship may I do thee?\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"None, but to\n"+
		"Maintain my opinion.\n"+
		"ALCIBIADES\n"+
		"What is it, Timon?\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Promise me friendship, but perform none: if thou\n"+
		"wilt not promise, the gods plague thee, for thou art\n"+
		"a man! if thou dost perform, confound thee, for\n"+
		"thou art a man!\n"+
		"ALCIBIADES\n"+
		"I have heard in some sort of thy miseries.\n"+

		"Is this the Athenian minion, whom the world\n"+
		"Voiced so regardfully?\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Art thou Timandra?\n"+
		"TIMANDRA\n"+
		"Yes.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Be a whore still: they love thee not that use thee;\n"+
		"Give them diseases, leaving with thee their lust.\n"+
		"Make use of thy salt hours: season the slaves\n"+
		"For tubs and baths; bring down rose-cheeked youth\n"+
		"To the tub-fast and the diet.\n"+
		"TIMANDRA\n"+
		"Hang thee, monster!\n"+
		"ALCIBIADES\n"+
		"Pardon him, sweet Timandra; for his wits\n"+
		"Are drown'd and lost in his calamities.\n"+
		"I have but little gold of late, brave Timon,\n"+
		"The want whereof doth daily make revolt\n"+
		"In my penurious band: I have heard, and grieved,\n"+
		"How cursed Athens, mindless of thy worth,\n"+
		"Forgetting thy great deeds, when neighbour states,\n"+
		"But for thy sword and fortune, trod upon them,--\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"I prithee, beat thy drum, and get thee gone.\n"+

		"TIMON\n"+

		"I had rather be alone.\n"+
		"ALCIBIADES\n"+
		"Why, fare thee well:\n"+

		"Why me, Timon?\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"That, by killing of villains,\n"+
		"Thou wast born to conquer my country.\n"+
		"Put up thy gold: go on,--here's gold,--go on;\n"+
		"Be as a planetary plague, when Jove\n"+
		"Will o'er some high-viced city hang his poison\n"+
		"In the sick air: let not thy sword skip one:\n"+
		"Pity not honour'd age for his white beard;\n"+

		"Put armour on thine ears and on thine eyes;\n"+
		"Whose proof, nor yells of mothers, maids, nor babes,\n"+

		"Give us some gold, good Timon: hast thou more?\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Enough to make a whore forswear her trade,\n"+

		"Your aprons mountant: you are not oathable,\n"+
		"Although, I know, you 'll swear, terribly swear\n"+
		"Into strong shudders and to heavenly agues\n"+

		"TIMON\n"+
		"Consumptions sow\n"+
		"In hollow bones of man; strike their sharp shins,\n"+
		"And mar men's spurring. Crack the lawyer's voice,\n"+
		"That he may never more false title plead,\n"+
		"Nor sound his quillets shrilly: hoar the flamen,\n"+
		"That scolds against the quality of flesh,\n"+
		"And not believes himself: down with the nose,\n"+
		"Down with it flat; take the bridge quite away\n"+
		"Of him that, his particular to foresee,\n"+
		"Smells from the general weal: make curl'd-pate\n"+
		"ruffians bald;\n"+
		"And let the unscarr'd braggarts of the war\n"+
		"Derive some pain from you: plague all;\n"+
		"That your activity may defeat and quell\n"+

		"ALCIBIADES\n"+
		"We but offend him. Strike!\n"+
		"Drum beats. Exeunt ALCIBIADES, PHRYNIA, and TIMANDRA\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"That nature, being sick of man's unkindness,\n"+
		"Should yet be hungry! Common mother, thou,\n"+
		"Digging\n"+
		"Whose womb unmeasurable, and infinite breast,\n"+
		"Teems, and feeds all; whose self-same mettle,\n"+
		"Whereof thy proud child, arrogant man, is puff'd,\n"+
		"Engenders the black toad and adder blue,\n"+
		"The gilded newt and eyeless venom'd worm,\n"+
		"With all the abhorred births below crisp heaven\n"+

		"Yield him, who all thy human sons doth hate,\n"+
		"From forth thy plenteous bosom, one poor root!\n"+
		"Ensear thy fertile and conceptious womb,\n"+
		"Let it no more bring out ingrateful man!\n"+
		"Go great with tigers, dragons, wolves, and bears;\n"+

		"Hath to the marbled mansion all above\n"+
		"Never presented!--O, a root,--dear thanks!--\n"+
		"Dry up thy marrows, vines, and plough-torn leas;\n"+

		"TIMON\n"+
		"'Tis, then, because thou dost not keep a dog,\n"+
		"Whom I would imitate: consumption catch thee!\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"This is in thee a nature but infected;\n"+
		"A poor unmanly melancholy sprung\n"+
		"From change of fortune. Why this spade? this place?\n"+
		"This slave-like habit? and these looks of care?\n"+
		"Thy flatterers yet wear silk, drink wine, lie soft;\n"+
		"Hug their diseased perfumes, and have forgot\n"+
		"That ever Timon was. Shame not these woods,\n"+
		"By putting on the cunning of a carper.\n"+
		"Be thou a flatterer now, and seek to thrive\n"+
		"By that which has undone thee: hinge thy knee,\n"+
		"And let his very breath, whom thou'lt observe,\n"+
		"Blow off thy cap; praise his most vicious strain,\n"+
		"And call it excellent: thou wast told thus;\n"+
		"Thou gavest thine ears like tapsters that bid welcome\n"+
		"To knaves and all approachers: 'tis most just\n"+
		"That thou turn rascal; hadst thou wealth again,\n"+
		"Rascals should have 't. Do not assume my likeness.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Were I like thee, I'ld throw away myself.\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Thou hast cast away thyself, being like thyself;\n"+
		"A madman so long, now a fool. What, think'st\n"+
		"That the bleak air, thy boisterous chamberlain,\n"+
		"Will put thy shirt on warm? will these moss'd trees,\n"+
		"That have outlived the eagle, page thy heels,\n"+
		"And skip where thou point'st out? will the\n"+
		"cold brook,\n"+
		"Candied with ice, caudle thy morning taste,\n"+
		"To cure thy o'er-night's surfeit? Call the creatures\n"+
		"Whose naked natures live in an the spite\n"+
		"Of wreakful heaven, whose bare unhoused trunks,\n"+
		"To the conflicting elements exposed,\n"+
		"Answer mere nature; bid them flatter thee;\n"+
		"O, thou shalt find--\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"A fool of thee: depart.\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"I love thee better now than e'er I did.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"I hate thee worse.\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Why?\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Thou flatter'st misery.\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"I flatter not; but say thou art a caitiff.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Why dost thou seek me out?\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"To vex thee.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Always a villain's office or a fool's.\n"+
		"Dost please thyself in't?\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Ay.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"What! a knave too?\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"If thou didst put this sour-cold habit on\n"+
		"To castigate thy pride, 'twere well: but thou\n"+
		"Dost it enforcedly; thou'ldst courtier be again,\n"+
		"Wert thou not beggar. Willing misery\n"+
		"Outlives encertain pomp, is crown'd before:\n"+
		"The one is filling still, never complete;\n"+
		"The other, at high wish: best state, contentless,\n"+
		"Hath a distracted and most wretched being,\n"+
		"Worse than the worst, content.\n"+
		"Thou shouldst desire to die, being miserable.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Not by his breath that is more miserable.\n"+
		"Thou art a slave, whom Fortune's tender arm\n"+
		"With favour never clasp'd; but bred a dog.\n"+
		"Hadst thou, like us from our first swath, proceeded\n"+
		"The sweet degrees that this brief world affords\n"+
		"To such as may the passive drugs of it\n"+
		"Freely command, thou wouldst have plunged thyself\n"+
		"In general riot; melted down thy youth\n"+
		"In different beds of lust; and never learn'd\n"+
		"The icy precepts of respect, but follow'd\n"+
		"The sugar'd game before thee. But myself,\n"+
		"Who had the world as my confectionary,\n"+
		"The mouths, the tongues, the eyes and hearts of men\n"+
		"At duty, more than I could frame employment,\n"+
		"That numberless upon me stuck as leaves\n"+
		"Do on the oak, hive with one winter's brush\n"+
		"Fell from their boughs and left me open, bare\n"+
		"For every storm that blows: I, to bear this,\n"+
		"That never knew but better, is some burden:\n"+
		"Thy nature did commence in sufferance, time\n"+
		"Hath made thee hard in't. Why shouldst thou hate men?\n"+
		"They never flatter'd thee: what hast thou given?\n"+
		"If thou wilt curse, thy father, that poor rag,\n"+
		"Must be thy subject, who in spite put stuff\n"+
		"To some she beggar and compounded thee\n"+
		"Poor rogue hereditary. Hence, be gone!\n"+
		"If thou hadst not been born the worst of men,\n"+
		"Thou hadst been a knave and flatterer.\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Art thou proud yet?\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Ay, that I am not thee.\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"I, that I was\n"+
		"No prodigal.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"I, that I am one now:\n"+
		"Were all the wealth I have shut up in thee,\n"+
		"I'ld give thee leave to hang it. Get thee gone.\n"+
		"That the whole life of Athens were in this!\n"+
		"Thus would I eat it.\n"+
		"Eating a root\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Here; I will mend thy feast.\n"+
		"Offering him a root\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"First mend my company, take away thyself.\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"So I shall mend mine own, by the lack of thine.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"'Tis not well mended so, it is but botch'd;\n"+
		"if not, I would it were.\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"What wouldst thou have to Athens?\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Thee thither in a whirlwind. If thou wilt,\n"+
		"Tell them there I have gold; look, so I have.\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Here is no use for gold.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"The best and truest;\n"+
		"For here it sleeps, and does no hired harm.\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Where liest o' nights, Timon?\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Under that's above me.\n"+
		"Where feed'st thou o' days, Apemantus?\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Where my stomach finds meat; or, rather, where I eat\n"+
		"it.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Would poison were obedient and knew my mind!\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Where wouldst thou send it?\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"To sauce thy dishes.\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"The middle of humanity thou never knewest, but the\n"+
		"extremity of both ends: when thou wast in thy gilt\n"+
		"and thy perfume, they mocked thee for too much\n"+
		"curiosity; in thy rags thou knowest none, but art\n"+
		"despised for the contrary. There's a medlar for\n"+
		"thee, eat it.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"On what I hate I feed not.\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Dost hate a medlar?\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Ay, though it look like thee.\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"An thou hadst hated meddlers sooner, thou shouldst\n"+
		"have loved thyself better now. What man didst thou\n"+
		"ever know unthrift that was beloved after his means?\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Who, without those means thou talkest of, didst thou\n"+
		"ever know beloved?\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Myself.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"I understand thee; thou hadst some means to keep a\n"+
		"dog.\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"What things in the world canst thou nearest compare\n"+
		"to thy flatterers?\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Women nearest; but men, men are the things\n"+
		"themselves. What wouldst thou do with the world,\n"+
		"Apemantus, if it lay in thy power?\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Give it the beasts, to be rid of the men.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Wouldst thou have thyself fall in the confusion of\n"+
		"men, and remain a beast with the beasts?\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Ay, Timon.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"A beastly ambition, which the gods grant thee t'\n"+
		"attain to! If thou wert the lion, the fox would\n"+
		"beguile thee; if thou wert the lamb, the fox would\n"+
		"eat three: if thou wert the fox, the lion would\n"+
		"suspect thee, when peradventure thou wert accused by\n"+
		"the ass: if thou wert the ass, thy dulness would\n"+
		"torment thee, and still thou livedst but as a\n"+
		"breakfast to the wolf: if thou wert the wolf, thy\n"+
		"greediness would afflict thee, and oft thou shouldst\n"+
		"hazard thy life for thy dinner: wert thou the\n"+
		"unicorn, pride and wrath would confound thee and\n"+
		"make thine own self the conquest of thy fury: wert\n"+
		"thou a bear, thou wouldst be killed by the horse:\n"+
		"wert thou a horse, thou wouldst be seized by the\n"+
		"leopard: wert thou a leopard, thou wert german to\n"+
		"the lion and the spots of thy kindred were jurors on\n"+
		"thy life: all thy safety were remotion and thy\n"+
		"defence absence. What beast couldst thou be, that\n"+
		"were not subject to a beast? and what a beast art\n"+
		"thou already, that seest not thy loss in\n"+
		"transformation!\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"If thou couldst please me with speaking to me, thou\n"+
		"mightst have hit upon it here: the commonwealth of\n"+
		"Athens is become a forest of beasts.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"How has the ass broke the wall, that thou art out of the city?\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Yonder comes a poet and a painter: the plague of\n"+
		"company light upon thee! I will fear to catch it\n"+
		"and give way: when I know not what else to do, I'll\n"+
		"see thee again.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"When there is nothing living but thee, thou shalt be\n"+
		"welcome. I had rather be a beggar's dog than Apemantus.\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Thou art the cap of all the fools alive.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Would thou wert clean enough to spit upon!\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"A plague on thee! thou art too bad to curse.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"All villains that do stand by thee are pure.\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"There is no leprosy but what thou speak'st.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"If I name thee.\n"+
		"I'll beat thee, but I should infect my hands.\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"I would my tongue could rot them off!\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Away, thou issue of a mangy dog!\n"+
		"Choler does kill me that thou art alive;\n"+
		"I swound to see thee.\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Would thou wouldst burst!\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Away,\n"+
		"Thou tedious rogue! I am sorry I shall lose\n"+
		"A stone by thee.\n"+
		"Throws a stone at him\n"+

		"TIMON\n"+
		"Rogue, rogue, rogue!\n"+
		"I am sick of this false world, and will love nought\n"+
		"But even the mere necessities upon 't.\n"+
		"Then, Timon, presently prepare thy grave;\n"+
		"Lie where the light foam the sea may beat\n"+
		"Thy grave-stone daily: make thine epitaph,\n"+
		"That death in me at others' lives may laugh.\n"+
		"To the gold\n"+
		"O thou sweet king-killer, and dear divorce\n"+
		"'Twixt natural son and sire! thou bright defiler\n"+
		"Of Hymen's purest bed! thou valiant Mars!\n"+
		"Thou ever young, fresh, loved and delicate wooer,\n"+
		"Whose blush doth thaw the consecrated snow\n"+
		"That lies on Dian's lap! thou visible god,\n"+
		"That solder'st close impossibilities,\n"+
		"And makest them kiss! that speak'st with\n"+
		"every tongue,\n"+
		"To every purpose! O thou touch of hearts!\n"+
		"Think, thy slave man rebels, and by thy virtue\n"+
		"Set them into confounding odds, that beasts\n"+
		"May have the world in empire!\n"+
		"APEMANTUS\n"+
		"Would 'twere so!\n"+
		"But not till I am dead. I'll say thou'st gold:\n"+

		"Ay.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Thy back, I prithee.\n"+

		"Long live so, and so die.\n"+
		"Exit APEMANTUS\n"+
		"I am quit.\n"+
		"Moe things like men! Eat, Timon, and abhor them.\n"+
		"Enter Banditti\n"+
		"First Bandit\n"+
		"Where should he have this gold? It is some poor\n"+
		"fragment, some slender sort of his remainder: the\n"+
		"mere want of gold, and the falling-from of his\n"+
		"friends, drove him into this melancholy.\n"+
		"Second Bandit\n"+
		"It is noised he hath a mass of treasure.\n"+
		"Third Bandit\n"+
		"Let us make the assay upon him: if he care not\n"+
		"for't, he will supply us easily; if he covetously\n"+
		"reserve it, how shall's get it?\n"+
		"Second Bandit\n"+
		"True; for he bears it not about him, 'tis hid.\n"+
		"First Bandit\n"+
		"Is not this he?\n"+
		"Banditti\n"+
		"Where?\n"+
		"Second Bandit\n"+
		"'Tis his description.\n"+
		"Third Bandit\n"+
		"He; I know him.\n"+
		"Banditti\n"+
		"Save thee, Timon.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Now, thieves?\n"+
		"Banditti\n"+
		"Soldiers, not thieves.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Both too; and women's sons.\n"+
		"Banditti\n"+
		"We are not thieves, but men that much do want.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Your greatest want is, you want much of meat.\n"+
		"Why should you want? Behold, the earth hath roots;\n"+
		"Within this mile break forth a hundred springs;\n"+
		"The oaks bear mast, the briers scarlet hips;\n"+
		"The bounteous housewife, nature, on each bush\n"+
		"Lays her full mess before you. Want! why want?\n"+
		"First Bandit\n"+
		"We cannot live on grass, on berries, water,\n"+
		"As beasts and birds and fishes.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Nor on the beasts themselves, the birds, and fishes;\n"+
		"You must eat men. Yet thanks I must you con\n"+
		"That you are thieves profess'd, that you work not\n"+
		"In holier shapes: for there is boundless theft\n"+
		"In limited professions. Rascal thieves,\n"+
		"Here's gold. Go, suck the subtle blood o' the grape,\n"+
		"Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth,\n"+
		"And so 'scape hanging: trust not the physician;\n"+
		"His antidotes are poison, and he slays\n"+
		"Moe than you rob: take wealth and lives together;\n"+
		"Do villany, do, since you protest to do't,\n"+
		"Like workmen. I'll example you with thievery.\n"+
		"The sun's a thief, and with his great attraction\n"+
		"Robs the vast sea: the moon's an arrant thief,\n"+
		"And her pale fire she snatches from the sun:\n"+
		"The sea's a thief, whose liquid surge resolves\n"+
		"The moon into salt tears: the earth's a thief,\n"+
		"That feeds and breeds by a composture stolen\n"+
		"From general excrement: each thing's a thief:\n"+
		"The laws, your curb and whip, in their rough power\n"+
		"Have uncheque'd theft. Love not yourselves: away,\n"+
		"Rob one another. There's more gold. Cut throats:\n"+
		"All that you meet are thieves: to Athens go,\n"+
		"Break open shops; nothing can you steal,\n"+
		"But thieves do lose it: steal no less for this\n"+
		"I give you; and gold confound you howsoe'er! Amen.\n"+
		"Third Bandit\n"+
		"Has almost charmed me from my profession, by\n"+

		"First Bandit\n"+
		"'Tis in the malice of mankind that he thus advises\n"+

		"FLAVIUS\n"+
		"O you gods!\n"+

		"What viler thing upon the earth than friends\n"+
		"Who can bring noblest minds to basest ends!\n"+
		"How rarely does it meet with this time's guise,\n"+
		"When man was wish'd to love his enemies!\n"+
		"Grant I may ever love, and rather woo\n"+
		"Those that would mischief me than those that do!\n"+
		"Has caught me in his eye: I will present\n"+
		"My honest grief unto him; and, as my lord,\n"+
		"Still serve him with my life. My dearest master!\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Away! what art thou?\n"+
		"FLAVIUS\n"+
		"Have you forgot me, sir?\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Why dost ask that? I have forgot all men;\n"+
		"Then, if thou grant'st thou'rt a man, I have forgot thee.\n"+
		"FLAVIUS\n"+
		"An honest poor servant of yours.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Then I know thee not:\n"+
		"I never had honest man about me, I; all\n"+
		"I kept were knaves, to serve in meat to villains.\n"+
		"FLAVIUS\n"+
		"The gods are witness,\n"+
		"Ne'er did poor steward wear a truer grief\n"+
		"For his undone lord than mine eyes for you.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"What, dost thou weep? Come nearer. Then I\n"+
		"love thee,\n"+
		"Because thou art a woman, and disclaim'st\n"+
		"Flinty mankind; whose eyes do never give\n"+
		"But thorough lust and laughter. Pity's sleeping:\n"+
		"Strange times, that weep with laughing, not with weeping!\n"+
		"FLAVIUS\n"+
		"I beg of you to know me, good my lord,\n"+
		"To accept my grief and whilst this poor wealth lasts\n"+
		"To entertain me as your steward still.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Had I a steward\n"+
		"So true, so just, and now so comfortable?\n"+
		"It almost turns my dangerous nature mild.\n"+
		"Let me behold thy face. Surely, this man\n"+
		"Was born of woman.\n"+
		"Forgive my general and exceptless rashness,\n"+
		"You perpetual-sober gods! I do proclaim\n"+
		"One honest man--mistake me not--but one;\n"+
		"No more, I pray,--and he's a steward.\n"+
		"How fain would I have hated all mankind!\n"+
		"And thou redeem'st thyself: but all, save thee,\n"+
		"I fell with curses.\n"+
		"Methinks thou art more honest now than wise;\n"+
		"For, by oppressing and betraying me,\n"+
		"Thou mightst have sooner got another service:\n"+
		"For many so arrive at second masters,\n"+
		"Upon their first lord's neck. But tell me true--\n"+
		"For I must ever doubt, though ne'er so sure--\n"+
		"Is not thy kindness subtle, covetous,\n"+
		"If not a usuring kindness, and, as rich men deal gifts,\n"+
		"Expecting in return twenty for one?\n"+
		"FLAVIUS\n"+
		"No, my most worthy master; in whose breast\n"+
		"Doubt and suspect, alas, are placed too late:\n"+
		"You should have fear'd false times when you did feast:\n"+
		"Suspect still comes where an estate is least.\n"+
		"That which I show, heaven knows, is merely love,\n"+
		"Duty and zeal to your unmatched mind,\n"+
		"Care of your food and living; and, believe it,\n"+
		"My most honour'd lord,\n"+
		"For any benefit that points to me,\n"+
		"Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange\n"+
		"For this one wish, that you had power and wealth\n"+
		"To requite me, by making rich yourself.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Look thee, 'tis so! Thou singly honest man,\n"+
		"Here, take: the gods out of my misery\n"+
		"Have sent thee treasure. Go, live rich and happy;\n"+
		"But thus condition'd: thou shalt build from men;\n"+
		"Hate all, curse all, show charity to none,\n"+
		"But let the famish'd flesh slide from the bone,\n"+
		"Ere thou relieve the beggar; give to dogs\n"+
		"What thou deny'st to men; let prisons swallow 'em,\n"+
		"Debts wither 'em to nothing; be men like\n"+
		"blasted woods,\n"+
		"And may diseases lick up their false bloods!\n"+
		"And so farewell and thrive.\n"+
		"FLAVIUS\n"+
		"O, let me stay,\n"+
		"And comfort you, my master.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"If thou hatest curses,\n"+
		"Stay not; fly, whilst thou art blest and free:\n"+
		"Ne'er see thou man, and let me ne'er see thee.\n"+
		"Exit FLAVIUS. TIMON retires to his cave\n"+
		"ACT V\n"+
		"SCENE I. The woods. Before Timon's cave.\n"+
		"Enter Poet and Painter; TIMON watching them from his cave\n"+
		"Painter\n"+
		"As I took note of the place, it cannot be far where\n"+
		"he abides.\n"+
		"Poet\n"+
		"What's to be thought of him? does the rumour hold\n"+
		"for true, that he's so full of gold?\n"+
		"Painter\n"+
		"Certain: Alcibiades reports it; Phrynia and\n"+
		"Timandra had gold of him: he likewise enriched poor\n"+
		"straggling soldiers with great quantity: 'tis said\n"+
		"he gave unto his steward a mighty sum.\n"+
		"Poet\n"+
		"Then this breaking of his has been but a try for his friends.\n"+
		"Painter\n"+
		"Nothing else: you shall see him a palm in Athens\n"+
		"again, and flourish with the highest. Therefore\n"+
		"'tis not amiss we tender our loves to him, in this\n"+
		"supposed distress of his: it will show honestly in\n"+
		"us; and is very likely to load our purposes with\n"+
		"what they travail for, if it be a just true report\n"+
		"that goes of his having.\n"+
		"Poet\n"+
		"What have you now to present unto him?\n"+
		"Painter\n"+
		"Nothing at this time but my visitation: only I will\n"+
		"promise him an excellent piece.\n"+
		"Poet\n"+
		"I must serve him so too, tell him of an intent\n"+
		"that's coming toward him.\n"+
		"Painter\n"+
		"Good as the best. Promising is the very air o' the\n"+
		"time: it opens the eyes of expectation:\n"+
		"performance is ever the duller for his act; and,\n"+
		"but in the plainer and simpler kind of people, the\n"+
		"deed of saying is quite out of use. To promise is\n"+
		"most courtly and fashionable: performance is a kind\n"+
		"of will or testament which argues a great sickness\n"+
		"in his judgment that makes it.\n"+
		"TIMON comes from his cave, behind\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"[Aside] Excellent workman! thou canst not paint a\n"+
		"man so bad as is thyself.\n"+
		"Poet\n"+
		"I am thinking what I shall say I have provided for\n"+
		"him: it must be a personating of himself; a satire\n"+
		"against the softness of prosperity, with a discovery\n"+
		"of the infinite flatteries that follow youth and opulency.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"[Aside] Must thou needs stand for a villain in\n"+
		"thine own work? wilt thou whip thine own faults in\n"+
		"other men? Do so, I have gold for thee.\n"+
		"Poet\n"+
		"Nay, let's seek him:\n"+
		"Then do we sin against our own estate,\n"+
		"When we may profit meet, and come too late.\n"+
		"Painter\n"+
		"True;\n"+
		"When the day serves, before black-corner'd night,\n"+
		"Find what thou want'st by free and offer'd light. Come.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"[Aside] I'll meet you at the turn. What a\n"+
		"god's gold,\n"+
		"That he is worshipp'd in a baser temple\n"+
		"Than where swine feed!\n"+
		"'Tis thou that rigg'st the bark and plough'st the foam,\n"+
		"Settlest admired reverence in a slave:\n"+
		"To thee be worship! and thy saints for aye\n"+
		"Be crown'd with plagues that thee alone obey!\n"+
		"Fit I meet them.\n"+
		"Coming forward\n"+
		"Poet\n"+
		"Hail, worthy Timon!\n"+
		"Painter\n"+
		"Our late noble master!\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Have I once lived to see two honest men?\n"+
		"Poet\n"+
		"Sir,\n"+
		"Having often of your open bounty tasted,\n"+
		"Hearing you were retired, your friends fall'n off,\n"+
		"Whose thankless natures--O abhorred spirits!--\n"+
		"Not all the whips of heaven are large enough:\n"+
		"What! to you,\n"+
		"Whose star-like nobleness gave life and influence\n"+
		"To their whole being! I am rapt and cannot cover\n"+
		"The monstrous bulk of this ingratitude\n"+
		"With any size of words.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Let it go naked, men may see't the better:\n"+
		"You that are honest, by being what you are,\n"+
		"Make them best seen and known.\n"+
		"Painter\n"+
		"He and myself\n"+
		"Have travail'd in the great shower of your gifts,\n"+
		"And sweetly felt it.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Ay, you are honest men.\n"+
		"Painter\n"+
		"We are hither come to offer you our service.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Most honest men! Why, how shall I requite you?\n"+
		"Can you eat roots, and drink cold water? no.\n"+
		"Both\n"+
		"What we can do, we'll do, to do you service.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Ye're honest men: ye've heard that I have gold;\n"+
		"I am sure you have: speak truth; ye're honest men.\n"+
		"Painter\n"+
		"So it is said, my noble lord; but therefore\n"+
		"Came not my friend nor I.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Good honest men! Thou draw'st a counterfeit\n"+
		"Best in all Athens: thou'rt, indeed, the best;\n"+
		"Thou counterfeit'st most lively.\n"+
		"Painter\n"+
		"So, so, my lord.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"E'en so, sir, as I say. And, for thy fiction,\n"+
		"Why, thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth\n"+
		"That thou art even natural in thine art.\n"+
		"But, for all this, my honest-natured friends,\n"+
		"I must needs say you have a little fault:\n"+
		"Marry, 'tis not monstrous in you, neither wish I\n"+
		"You take much pains to mend.\n"+
		"Both\n"+
		"Beseech your honour\n"+
		"To make it known to us.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"You'll take it ill.\n"+
		"Both\n"+
		"Most thankfully, my lord.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Will you, indeed?\n"+
		"Both\n"+
		"Doubt it not, worthy lord.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"There's never a one of you but trusts a knave,\n"+
		"That mightily deceives you.\n"+
		"Both\n"+
		"Do we, my lord?\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Ay, and you hear him cog, see him dissemble,\n"+
		"Know his gross patchery, love him, feed him,\n"+
		"Keep in your bosom: yet remain assured\n"+
		"That he's a made-up villain.\n"+
		"Painter\n"+
		"I know none such, my lord.\n"+
		"Poet\n"+
		"Nor I.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Look you, I love you well; I'll give you gold,\n"+
		"Rid me these villains from your companies:\n"+
		"Hang them or stab them, drown them in a draught,\n"+
		"Confound them by some course, and come to me,\n"+
		"I'll give you gold enough.\n"+
		"Both\n"+
		"Name them, my lord, let's know them.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"You that way and you this, but two in company;\n"+
		"Each man apart, all single and alone,\n"+
		"Yet an arch-villain keeps him company.\n"+
		"If where thou art two villains shall not be,\n"+
		"Come not near him. If thou wouldst not reside\n"+
		"But where one villain is, then him abandon.\n"+
		"Hence, pack! there's gold; you came for gold, ye slaves:\n"+
		"To Painter\n"+
		"You have work'd for me; there's payment for you: hence!\n"+
		"To Poet\n"+
		"You are an alchemist; make gold of that.\n"+
		"Out, rascal dogs!\n"+
		"Beats them out, and then retires to his cave\n"+
		"Enter FLAVIUS and two Senators\n"+
		"FLAVIUS\n"+
		"It is in vain that you would speak with Timon;\n"+
		"For he is set so only to himself\n"+
		"That nothing but himself which looks like man\n"+
		"Is friendly with him.\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"Bring us to his cave:\n"+
		"It is our part and promise to the Athenians\n"+
		"To speak with Timon.\n"+
		"Second Senator\n"+
		"At all times alike\n"+
		"Men are not still the same: 'twas time and griefs\n"+
		"That framed him thus: time, with his fairer hand,\n"+
		"Offering the fortunes of his former days,\n"+
		"The former man may make him. Bring us to him,\n"+
		"And chance it as it may.\n"+
		"FLAVIUS\n"+
		"Here is his cave.\n"+
		"Peace and content be here! Lord Timon! Timon!\n"+
		"Look out, and speak to friends: the Athenians,\n"+
		"By two of their most reverend senate, greet thee:\n"+
		"Speak to them, noble Timon.\n"+
		"TIMON comes from his cave\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Thou sun, that comfort'st, burn! Speak, and\n"+
		"be hang'd:\n"+
		"For each true word, a blister! and each false\n"+
		"Be as cauterizing to the root o' the tongue,\n"+
		"Consuming it with speaking!\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"Worthy Timon,--\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Of none but such as you, and you of Timon.\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"The senators of Athens greet thee, Timon.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"I thank them; and would send them back the plague,\n"+
		"Could I but catch it for them.\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"O, forget\n"+
		"What we are sorry for ourselves in thee.\n"+
		"The senators with one consent of love\n"+
		"Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought\n"+
		"On special dignities, which vacant lie\n"+
		"For thy best use and wearing.\n"+
		"Second Senator\n"+
		"They confess\n"+
		"Toward thee forgetfulness too general, gross:\n"+
		"Which now the public body, which doth seldom\n"+
		"Play the recanter, feeling in itself\n"+
		"A lack of Timon's aid, hath sense withal\n"+
		"Of its own fail, restraining aid to Timon;\n"+
		"And send forth us, to make their sorrow'd render,\n"+
		"Together with a recompense more fruitful\n"+
		"Than their offence can weigh down by the dram;\n"+
		"Ay, even such heaps and sums of love and wealth\n"+
		"As shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs\n"+
		"And write in thee the figures of their love,\n"+
		"Ever to read them thine.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"You witch me in it;\n"+
		"Surprise me to the very brink of tears:\n"+
		"Lend me a fool's heart and a woman's eyes,\n"+
		"And I'll beweep these comforts, worthy senators.\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"Therefore, so please thee to return with us\n"+
		"And of our Athens, thine and ours, to take\n"+
		"The captainship, thou shalt be met with thanks,\n"+
		"Allow'd with absolute power and thy good name\n"+
		"Live with authority: so soon we shall drive back\n"+
		"Of Alcibiades the approaches wild,\n"+
		"Who, like a boar too savage, doth root up\n"+
		"His country's peace.\n"+
		"Second Senator\n"+
		"And shakes his threatening sword\n"+
		"Against the walls of Athens.\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"Therefore, Timon,--\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Well, sir, I will; therefore, I will, sir; thus:\n"+
		"If Alcibiades kill my countrymen,\n"+
		"Let Alcibiades know this of Timon,\n"+
		"That Timon cares not. But if be sack fair Athens,\n"+
		"And take our goodly aged men by the beards,\n"+
		"Giving our holy virgins to the stain\n"+
		"Of contumelious, beastly, mad-brain'd war,\n"+
		"Then let him know, and tell him Timon speaks it,\n"+
		"In pity of our aged and our youth,\n"+
		"I cannot choose but tell him, that I care not,\n"+
		"And let him take't at worst; for their knives care not,\n"+
		"While you have throats to answer: for myself,\n"+
		"There's not a whittle in the unruly camp\n"+
		"But I do prize it at my love before\n"+
		"The reverend'st throat in Athens. So I leave you\n"+
		"To the protection of the prosperous gods,\n"+
		"As thieves to keepers.\n"+
		"FLAVIUS\n"+
		"Stay not, all's in vain.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Why, I was writing of my epitaph;\n"+
		"it will be seen to-morrow: my long sickness\n"+
		"Of health and living now begins to mend,\n"+
		"And nothing brings me all things. Go, live still;\n"+
		"Be Alcibiades your plague, you his,\n"+
		"And last so long enough!\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"We speak in vain.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"But yet I love my country, and am not\n"+
		"One that rejoices in the common wreck,\n"+
		"As common bruit doth put it.\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"That's well spoke.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Commend me to my loving countrymen,--\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"These words become your lips as they pass\n"+
		"thorough them.\n"+
		"Second Senator\n"+
		"And enter in our ears like great triumphers\n"+
		"In their applauding gates.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Commend me to them,\n"+
		"And tell them that, to ease them of their griefs,\n"+
		"Their fears of hostile strokes, their aches, losses,\n"+
		"Their pangs of love, with other incident throes\n"+
		"That nature's fragile vessel doth sustain\n"+
		"In life's uncertain voyage, I will some kindness do them:\n"+
		"I'll teach them to prevent wild Alcibiades' wrath.\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"I like this well; he will return again.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"I have a tree, which grows here in my close,\n"+
		"That mine own use invites me to cut down,\n"+
		"And shortly must I fell it: tell my friends,\n"+
		"Tell Athens, in the sequence of degree\n"+
		"From high to low throughout, that whoso please\n"+
		"To stop affliction, let him take his haste,\n"+
		"Come hither, ere my tree hath felt the axe,\n"+
		"And hang himself. I pray you, do my greeting.\n"+
		"FLAVIUS\n"+
		"Trouble him no further; thus you still shall find him.\n"+
		"TIMON\n"+
		"Come not to me again: but say to Athens,\n"+
		"Timon hath made his everlasting mansion\n"+
		"Upon the beached verge of the salt flood;\n"+
		"Who once a day with his embossed froth\n"+
		"The turbulent surge shall cover: thither come,\n"+
		"And let my grave-stone be your oracle.\n"+
		"Lips, let sour words go by and language end:\n"+
		"What is amiss plague and infection mend!\n"+
		"Graves only be men's works and death their gain!\n"+
		"Sun, hide thy beams! Timon hath done his reign.\n"+
		"Retires to his cave\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"His discontents are unremoveably\n"+
		"Coupled to nature.\n"+
		"Second Senator\n"+
		"Our hope in him is dead: let us return,\n"+
		"And strain what other means is left unto us\n"+
		"In our dear peril.\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"It requires swift foot.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. Before the walls of Athens.\n"+
		"Enter two Senators and a Messenger\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"Thou hast painfully discover'd: are his files\n"+
		"As full as thy report?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"have spoke the least:\n"+
		"Besides, his expedition promises\n"+
		"Present approach.\n"+
		"Second Senator\n"+
		"We stand much hazard, if they bring not Timon.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"I met a courier, one mine ancient friend;\n"+
		"Whom, though in general part we were opposed,\n"+
		"Yet our old love made a particular force,\n"+
		"And made us speak like friends: this man was riding\n"+
		"From Alcibiades to Timon's cave,\n"+
		"With letters of entreaty, which imported\n"+
		"His fellowship i' the cause against your city,\n"+
		"In part for his sake moved.\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"Here come our brothers.\n"+
		"Enter the Senators from TIMON\n"+
		"Third Senator\n"+
		"No talk of Timon, nothing of him expect.\n"+
		"The enemies' drum is heard, and fearful scouring\n"+
		"Doth choke the air with dust: in, and prepare:\n"+
		"Ours is the fall, I fear; our foes the snare.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. The woods. Timon's cave, and a rude tomb seen.\n"+
		"Enter a Soldier, seeking TIMON\n"+
		"Soldier\n"+
		"By all description this should be the place.\n"+
		"Who's here? speak, ho! No answer! What is this?\n"+
		"Timon is dead, who hath outstretch'd his span:\n"+
		"Some beast rear'd this; there does not live a man.\n"+
		"Dead, sure; and this his grave. What's on this tomb\n"+
		"I cannot read; the character I'll take with wax:\n"+
		"Our captain hath in every figure skill,\n"+
		"An aged interpreter, though young in days:\n"+
		"Before proud Athens he's set down by this,\n"+
		"Whose fall the mark of his ambition is.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE IV. Before the walls of Athens.\n"+
		"Trumpets sound. Enter ALCIBIADES with his powers\n"+
		"ALCIBIADES\n"+
		"Sound to this coward and lascivious town\n"+
		"Our terrible approach.\n"+
		"A parley sounded\n"+
		"Enter Senators on the walls\n"+
		"Till now you have gone on and fill'd the time\n"+
		"With all licentious measure, making your wills\n"+
		"The scope of justice; till now myself and such\n"+
		"As slept within the shadow of your power\n"+
		"Hav e wander'd with our traversed arms and breathed\n"+
		"Our sufferance vainly: now the time is flush,\n"+
		"When crouching marrow in the bearer strong\n"+
		"Cries of itself 'No more:' now breathless wrong\n"+
		"Shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease,\n"+
		"And pursy insolence shall break his wind\n"+
		"With fear and horrid flight.\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"Noble and young,\n"+
		"When thy first griefs were but a mere conceit,\n"+
		"Ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear,\n"+
		"We sent to thee, to give thy rages balm,\n"+
		"To wipe out our ingratitude with loves\n"+
		"Above their quantity.\n"+
		"Second Senator\n"+
		"So did we woo\n"+
		"Transformed Timon to our city's love\n"+
		"By humble message and by promised means:\n"+
		"We were not all unkind, nor all deserve\n"+
		"The common stroke of war.\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"These walls of ours\n"+
		"Were not erected by their hands from whom\n"+
		"You have received your griefs; nor are they such\n"+
		"That these great towers, trophies and schools\n"+
		"should fall\n"+
		"For private faults in them.\n"+
		"Second Senator\n"+
		"Nor are they living\n"+
		"Who were the motives that you first went out;\n"+
		"Shame that they wanted cunning, in excess\n"+
		"Hath broke their hearts. March, noble lord,\n"+
		"Into our city with thy banners spread:\n"+
		"By decimation, and a tithed death--\n"+
		"If thy revenges hunger for that food\n"+
		"Which nature loathes--take thou the destined tenth,\n"+
		"And by the hazard of the spotted die\n"+
		"Let die the spotted.\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"All have not offended;\n"+
		"For those that were, it is not square to take\n"+
		"On those that are, revenges: crimes, like lands,\n"+
		"Are not inherited. Then, dear countryman,\n"+
		"Bring in thy ranks, but leave without thy rage:\n"+
		"Spare thy Athenian cradle and those kin\n"+
		"Which in the bluster of thy wrath must fall\n"+
		"With those that have offended: like a shepherd,\n"+
		"Approach the fold and cull the infected forth,\n"+
		"But kill not all together.\n"+
		"Second Senator\n"+
		"What thou wilt,\n"+
		"Thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile\n"+
		"Than hew to't with thy sword.\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"Set but thy foot\n"+
		"Against our rampired gates, and they shall ope;\n"+
		"So thou wilt send thy gentle heart before,\n"+
		"To say thou'lt enter friendly.\n"+
		"Second Senator\n"+
		"Throw thy glove,\n"+
		"Or any token of thine honour else,\n"+
		"That thou wilt use the wars as thy redress\n"+
		"And not as our confusion, all thy powers\n"+
		"Shall make their harbour in our town, till we\n"+
		"Have seal'd thy full desire.\n"+
		"ALCIBIADES\n"+
		"Then there's my glove;\n"+
		"Descend, and open your uncharged ports:\n"+
		"Those enemies of Timon's and mine own\n"+
		"Whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof\n"+
		"Fall and no more: and, to atone your fears\n"+
		"With my more noble meaning, not a man\n"+
		"Shall pass his quarter, or offend the stream\n"+
		"Of regular justice in your city's bounds,\n"+
		"But shall be render'd to your public laws\n"+
		"At heaviest answer.\n"+
		"Both\n"+
		"'Tis most nobly spoken.\n"+
		"ALCIBIADES\n"+
		"Descend, and keep your words.\n"+
		"The Senators descend, and open the gates\n"+
		"Enter Soldier\n"+
		"Soldier\n"+
