		"The Tragedy of Macbeth\n"+
		"ACT I\n"+
		"SCENE I. A desert place.\n"+
		"Thunder and lightning. Enter three Witches\n"+
		"First Witch\n"+
		"When shall we three meet again\n"+
		"In thunder, lightning, or in rain?\n"+
		"Second Witch\n"+
		"When the hurlyburly's done,\n"+
		"When the battle's lost and won.\n"+
		"Third Witch\n"+
		"That will be ere the set of sun.\n"+
		"First Witch\n"+
		"Where the place?\n"+
		"Second Witch\n"+
		"Upon the heath.\n"+
		"Third Witch\n"+
		"There to meet with Macbeth.\n"+
		"First Witch\n"+
		"I come, Graymalkin!\n"+
		"Second Witch\n"+
		"Paddock calls.\n"+
		"Third Witch\n"+
		"Anon.\n"+
		"ALL\n"+
		"Fair is foul, and foul is fair:\n"+
		"Hover through the fog and filthy air.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. A camp near Forres.\n"+
		"Alarum within. Enter DUNCAN, MALCOLM, DONALBAIN, LENNOX, with Attendants, meeting a bleeding Sergeant\n"+
		"DUNCAN\n"+
		"What bloody man is that? He can report,\n"+
		"As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt\n"+
		"The newest state.\n"+
		"MALCOLM\n"+
		"This is the sergeant\n"+
		"Who like a good and hardy soldier fought\n"+
		"'Gainst my captivity. Hail, brave friend!\n"+
		"Say to the king the knowledge of the broil\n"+
		"As thou didst leave it.\n"+
		"Sergeant\n"+
		"Doubtful it stood;\n"+
		"As two spent swimmers, that do cling together\n"+
		"And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald--\n"+
		"Worthy to be a rebel, for to that\n"+
		"The multiplying villanies of nature\n"+
		"Do swarm upon him--from the western isles\n"+
		"Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;\n"+
		"And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,\n"+
		"Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:\n"+
		"For brave Macbeth--well he deserves that name--\n"+
		"Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,\n"+
		"Which smoked with bloody execution,\n"+
		"Like valour's minion carved out his passage\n"+
		"Till he faced the slave;\n"+
		"Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,\n"+
		"Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps,\n"+
		"And fix'd his head upon our battlements.\n"+
		"DUNCAN\n"+
		"O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!\n"+
		"Sergeant\n"+
		"As whence the sun 'gins his reflection\n"+
		"Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break,\n"+
		"So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come\n"+
		"Discomfort swells. Mark, king of Scotland, mark:\n"+
		"No sooner justice had with valour arm'd\n"+
		"Compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels,\n"+
		"But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage,\n"+
		"With furbish'd arms and new supplies of men\n"+
		"Began a fresh assault.\n"+
		"DUNCAN\n"+
		"Dismay'd not this\n"+
		"Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?\n"+
		"Sergeant\n"+
		"Yes;\n"+
		"As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.\n"+
		"If I say sooth, I must report they were\n"+
		"As cannons overcharged with double cracks, so they\n"+
		"Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:\n"+
		"Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,\n"+
		"Or memorise another Golgotha,\n"+
		"I cannot tell.\n"+
		"But I am faint, my gashes cry for help.\n"+
		"DUNCAN\n"+
		"So well thy words become thee as thy wounds;\n"+
		"They smack of honour both. Go get him surgeons.\n"+
		"Exit Sergeant, attended\n"+
		"Who comes here?\n"+
		"Enter ROSS\n"+
		"MALCOLM\n"+
		"The worthy thane of Ross.\n"+
		"LENNOX\n"+
		"What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look\n"+
		"That seems to speak things strange.\n"+
		"ROSS\n"+
		"God save the king!\n"+
		"DUNCAN\n"+
		"Whence camest thou, worthy thane?\n"+
		"ROSS\n"+
		"From Fife, great king;\n"+
		"Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky\n"+
		"And fan our people cold. Norway himself,\n"+
		"With terrible numbers,\n"+
		"Assisted by that most disloyal traitor\n"+
		"The thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;\n"+
		"Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof,\n"+
		"Confronted him with self-comparisons,\n"+
		"Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm.\n"+
		"Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,\n"+
		"The victory fell on us.\n"+
		"DUNCAN\n"+
		"Great happiness!\n"+
		"ROSS\n"+
		"That now\n"+
		"Sweno, the Norways' king, craves composition:\n"+
		"Nor would we deign him burial of his men\n"+
		"Till he disbursed at Saint Colme's inch\n"+
		"Ten thousand dollars to our general use.\n"+
		"DUNCAN\n"+
		"No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive\n"+
		"Our bosom interest: go pronounce his present death,\n"+
		"And with his former title greet Macbeth.\n"+
		"ROSS\n"+
		"I'll see it done.\n"+
		"DUNCAN\n"+
		"What he hath lost noble Macbeth hath won.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. A heath near Forres.\n"+
		"Thunder. Enter the three Witches\n"+
		"First Witch\n"+
		"Where hast thou been, sister?\n"+
		"Second Witch\n"+
		"Killing swine.\n"+
		"Third Witch\n"+
		"Sister, where thou?\n"+
		"First Witch\n"+
		"A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap,\n"+
		"And munch'd, and munch'd, and munch'd:--\n"+
		"'Give me,' quoth I:\n"+
		"'Aroint thee, witch!' the rump-fed ronyon cries.\n"+
		"Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' the Tiger:\n"+
		"But in a sieve I'll thither sail,\n"+
		"And, like a rat without a tail,\n"+
		"I'll do, I'll do, and I'll do.\n"+
		"Second Witch\n"+
		"I'll give thee a wind.\n"+
		"First Witch\n"+
		"Thou'rt kind.\n"+
		"Third Witch\n"+
		"And I another.\n"+
		"First Witch\n"+
		"I myself have all the other,\n"+
		"And the very ports they blow,\n"+
		"All the quarters that they know\n"+
		"I' the shipman's card.\n"+
		"I will drain him dry as hay:\n"+
		"Sleep shall neither night nor day\n"+
		"Hang upon his pent-house lid;\n"+
		"He shall live a man forbid:\n"+
		"Weary se'nnights nine times nine\n"+
		"Shall he dwindle, peak and pine:\n"+
		"Though his bark cannot be lost,\n"+
		"Yet it shall be tempest-tost.\n"+
		"Look what I have.\n"+
		"Second Witch\n"+
		"Show me, show me.\n"+
		"First Witch\n"+
		"Here I have a pilot's thumb,\n"+
		"Wreck'd as homeward he did come.\n"+
		"Drum within\n"+
		"Third Witch\n"+
		"A drum, a drum!\n"+
		"Macbeth doth come.\n"+
		"ALL\n"+
		"The weird sisters, hand in hand,\n"+
		"Posters of the sea and land,\n"+
		"Thus do go about, about:\n"+
		"Thrice to thine and thrice to mine\n"+
		"And thrice again, to make up nine.\n"+
		"Peace! the charm's wound up.\n"+
		"Enter MACBETH and BANQUO\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"So foul and fair a day I have not seen.\n"+
		"BANQUO\n"+
		"How far is't call'd to Forres? What are these\n"+
		"So wither'd and so wild in their attire,\n"+
		"That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,\n"+
		"And yet are on't? Live you? or are you aught\n"+
		"That man may question? You seem to understand me,\n"+
		"By each at once her chappy finger laying\n"+
		"Upon her skinny lips: you should be women,\n"+
		"And yet your beards forbid me to interpret\n"+
		"That you are so.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Speak, if you can: what are you?\n"+
		"First Witch\n"+
		"All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, thane of Glamis!\n"+
		"Second Witch\n"+
		"All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, thane of Cawdor!\n"+
		"Third Witch\n"+
		"All hail, Macbeth, thou shalt be king hereafter!\n"+
		"BANQUO\n"+
		"Good sir, why do you start; and seem to fear\n"+
		"Things that do sound so fair? I' the name of truth,\n"+
		"Are ye fantastical, or that indeed\n"+
		"Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner\n"+
		"You greet with present grace and great prediction\n"+
		"Of noble having and of royal hope,\n"+
		"That he seems rapt withal: to me you speak not.\n"+
		"If you can look into the seeds of time,\n"+
		"And say which grain will grow and which will not,\n"+
		"Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear\n"+
		"Your favours nor your hate.\n"+
		"First Witch\n"+
		"Hail!\n"+
		"Second Witch\n"+
		"Hail!\n"+
		"Third Witch\n"+
		"Hail!\n"+
		"First Witch\n"+
		"Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.\n"+
		"Second Witch\n"+
		"Not so happy, yet much happier.\n"+
		"Third Witch\n"+
		"Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none:\n"+
		"So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!\n"+
		"First Witch\n"+
		"Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more:\n"+
		"By Sinel's death I know I am thane of Glamis;\n"+
		"But how of Cawdor? the thane of Cawdor lives,\n"+
		"A prosperous gentleman; and to be king\n"+
		"Stands not within the prospect of belief,\n"+
		"No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence\n"+
		"You owe this strange intelligence? or why\n"+
		"Upon this blasted heath you stop our way\n"+
		"With such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you.\n"+
		"Witches vanish\n"+
		"BANQUO\n"+
		"The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,\n"+
		"And these are of them. Whither are they vanish'd?\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Into the air; and what seem'd corporal melted\n"+
		"As breath into the wind. Would they had stay'd!\n"+
		"BANQUO\n"+
		"Were such things here as we do speak about?\n"+
		"Or have we eaten on the insane root\n"+
		"That takes the reason prisoner?\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Your children shall be kings.\n"+
		"BANQUO\n"+
		"You shall be king.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"And thane of Cawdor too: went it not so?\n"+
		"BANQUO\n"+
		"To the selfsame tune and words. Who's here?\n"+
		"Enter ROSS and ANGUS\n"+
		"ROSS\n"+
		"The king hath happily received, Macbeth,\n"+
		"The news of thy success; and when he reads\n"+
		"Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight,\n"+
		"His wonders and his praises do contend\n"+
		"Which should be thine or his: silenced with that,\n"+
		"In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day,\n"+
		"He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,\n"+
		"Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,\n"+
		"Strange images of death. As thick as hail\n"+
		"Came post with post; and every one did bear\n"+
		"Thy praises in his kingdom's great defence,\n"+
		"And pour'd them down before him.\n"+
		"ANGUS\n"+
		"We are sent\n"+
		"To give thee from our royal master thanks;\n"+
		"Only to herald thee into his sight,\n"+
		"Not pay thee.\n"+
		"ROSS\n"+
		"And, for an earnest of a greater honour,\n"+
		"He bade me, from him, call thee thane of Cawdor:\n"+
		"In which addition, hail, most worthy thane!\n"+
		"For it is thine.\n"+
		"BANQUO\n"+
		"What, can the devil speak true?\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"The thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me\n"+
		"In borrow'd robes?\n"+
		"ANGUS\n"+
		"Who was the thane lives yet;\n"+
		"But under heavy judgment bears that life\n"+
		"Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combined\n"+
		"With those of Norway, or did line the rebel\n"+
		"With hidden help and vantage, or that with both\n"+
		"He labour'd in his country's wreck, I know not;\n"+
		"But treasons capital, confess'd and proved,\n"+
		"Have overthrown him.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"[Aside] Glamis, and thane of Cawdor!\n"+
		"The greatest is behind.\n"+
		"To ROSS and ANGUS\n"+
		"Thanks for your pains.\n"+
		"To BANQUO\n"+
		"Do you not hope your children shall be kings,\n"+
		"When those that gave the thane of Cawdor to me\n"+
		"Promised no less to them?\n"+
		"BANQUO\n"+
		"That trusted home\n"+
		"Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,\n"+
		"Besides the thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:\n"+
		"And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,\n"+
		"The instruments of darkness tell us truths,\n"+
		"Win us with honest trifles, to betray's\n"+
		"In deepest consequence.\n"+
		"Cousins, a word, I pray you.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"[Aside] Two truths are told,\n"+
		"As happy prologues to the swelling act\n"+
		"Of the imperial theme.--I thank you, gentlemen.\n"+
		"Aside\n"+
		"Cannot be ill, cannot be good: if ill,\n"+
		"Why hath it given me earnest of success,\n"+
		"Commencing in a truth? I am thane of Cawdor:\n"+
		"If good, why do I yield to that suggestion\n"+
		"Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair\n"+
		"And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,\n"+
		"Against the use of nature? Present fears\n"+
		"Are less than horrible imaginings:\n"+
		"My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,\n"+
		"Shakes so my single state of man that function\n"+
		"Is smother'd in surmise, and nothing is\n"+
		"But what is not.\n"+
		"BANQUO\n"+
		"Look, how our partner's rapt.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"[Aside] If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me,\n"+
		"Without my stir.\n"+
		"BANQUO\n"+
		"New horrors come upon him,\n"+
		"Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould\n"+
		"But with the aid of use.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"[Aside] Come what come may,\n"+
		"Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.\n"+
		"BANQUO\n"+
		"Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Give me your favour: my dull brain was wrought\n"+
		"With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains\n"+
		"Are register'd where every day I turn\n"+
		"The leaf to read them. Let us toward the king.\n"+
		"Think upon what hath chanced, and, at more time,\n"+
		"The interim having weigh'd it, let us speak\n"+
		"Our free hearts each to other.\n"+
		"BANQUO\n"+
		"Very gladly.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Till then, enough. Come, friends.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV. Forres. The palace.\n"+
		"Flourish. Enter DUNCAN, MALCOLM, DONALBAIN, LENNOX, and Attendants\n"+
		"DUNCAN\n"+
		"Is execution done on Cawdor? Are not\n"+
		"Those in commission yet return'd?\n"+
		"MALCOLM\n"+
		"My liege,\n"+
		"They are not yet come back. But I have spoke\n"+
		"With one that saw him die: who did report\n"+
		"That very frankly he confess'd his treasons,\n"+
		"Implored your highness' pardon and set forth\n"+
		"A deep repentance: nothing in his life\n"+
		"Became him like the leaving it; he died\n"+
		"As one that had been studied in his death\n"+
		"To throw away the dearest thing he owed,\n"+
		"As 'twere a careless trifle.\n"+
		"DUNCAN\n"+
		"There's no art\n"+
		"To find the mind's construction in the face:\n"+
		"He was a gentleman on whom I built\n"+
		"An absolute trust.\n"+
		"Enter MACBETH, BANQUO, ROSS, and ANGUS\n"+
		"O worthiest cousin!\n"+
		"The sin of my ingratitude even now\n"+
		"Was heavy on me: thou art so far before\n"+
		"That swiftest wing of recompense is slow\n"+
		"To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserved,\n"+
		"That the proportion both of thanks and payment\n"+
		"Might have been mine! only I have left to say,\n"+
		"More is thy due than more than all can pay.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"The service and the loyalty I owe,\n"+
		"In doing it, pays itself. Your highness' part\n"+
		"Is to receive our duties; and our duties\n"+
		"Are to your throne and state children and servants,\n"+
		"Which do but what they should, by doing every thing\n"+
		"Safe toward your love and honour.\n"+
		"DUNCAN\n"+
		"Welcome hither:\n"+
		"I have begun to plant thee, and will labour\n"+
		"To make thee full of growing. Noble Banquo,\n"+
		"That hast no less deserved, nor must be known\n"+
		"No less to have done so, let me enfold thee\n"+
		"And hold thee to my heart.\n"+
		"BANQUO\n"+
		"There if I grow,\n"+
		"The harvest is your own.\n"+
		"DUNCAN\n"+
		"My plenteous joys,\n"+
		"Wanton in fulness, seek to hide themselves\n"+
		"In drops of sorrow. Sons, kinsmen, thanes,\n"+
		"And you whose places are the nearest, know\n"+
		"We will establish our estate upon\n"+
		"Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter\n"+
		"The Prince of Cumberland; which honour must\n"+
		"Not unaccompanied invest him only,\n"+
		"But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine\n"+
		"On all deservers. From hence to Inverness,\n"+
		"And bind us further to you.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"The rest is labour, which is not used for you:\n"+
		"I'll be myself the harbinger and make joyful\n"+
		"The hearing of my wife with your approach;\n"+
		"So humbly take my leave.\n"+
		"DUNCAN\n"+
		"My worthy Cawdor!\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"[Aside] The Prince of Cumberland! that is a step\n"+
		"On which I must fall down, or else o'erleap,\n"+
		"For in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires;\n"+
		"Let not light see my black and deep desires:\n"+
		"The eye wink at the hand; yet let that be,\n"+
		"Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"DUNCAN\n"+
		"True, worthy Banquo; he is full so valiant,\n"+
		"And in his commendations I am fed;\n"+
		"It is a banquet to me. Let's after him,\n"+
		"Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome:\n"+
		"It is a peerless kinsman.\n"+
		"Flourish. Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE V. Inverness. Macbeth's castle.\n"+
		"Enter LADY MACBETH, reading a letter\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"'They met me in the day of success: and I have\n"+
		"learned by the perfectest report, they have more in\n"+
		"them than mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire\n"+
		"to question them further, they made themselves air,\n"+
		"into which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in\n"+
		"the wonder of it, came missives from the king, who\n"+
		"all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor;' by which title,\n"+
		"before, these weird sisters saluted me, and referred\n"+
		"me to the coming on of time, with 'Hail, king that\n"+
		"shalt be!' This have I thought good to deliver\n"+
		"thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou\n"+
		"mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being\n"+
		"ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it\n"+
		"to thy heart, and farewell.'\n"+
		"Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be\n"+
		"What thou art promised: yet do I fear thy nature;\n"+
		"It is too full o' the milk of human kindness\n"+
		"To catch the nearest way: thou wouldst be great;\n"+
		"Art not without ambition, but without\n"+
		"The illness should attend it: what thou wouldst highly,\n"+
		"That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,\n"+
		"And yet wouldst wrongly win: thou'ldst have, great Glamis,\n"+
		"That which cries 'Thus thou must do, if thou have it;\n"+
		"And that which rather thou dost fear to do\n"+
		"Than wishest should be undone.' Hie thee hither,\n"+
		"That I may pour my spirits in thine ear;\n"+
		"And chastise with the valour of my tongue\n"+
		"All that impedes thee from the golden round,\n"+
		"Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem\n"+
		"To have thee crown'd withal.\n"+
		"Enter a Messenger\n"+
		"What is your tidings?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"The king comes here to-night.\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"Thou'rt mad to say it:\n"+
		"Is not thy master with him? who, were't so,\n"+
		"Would have inform'd for preparation.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"So please you, it is true: our thane is coming:\n"+
		"One of my fellows had the speed of him,\n"+
		"Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more\n"+
		"Than would make up his message.\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"Give him tending;\n"+
		"He brings great news.\n"+
		"Exit Messenger\n"+
		"The raven himself is hoarse\n"+
		"That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan\n"+
		"Under my battlements. Come, you spirits\n"+
		"That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,\n"+
		"And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full\n"+
		"Of direst cruelty! make thick my blood;\n"+
		"Stop up the access and passage to remorse,\n"+
		"That no compunctious visitings of nature\n"+
		"Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between\n"+
		"The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts,\n"+
		"And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers,\n"+
		"Wherever in your sightless substances\n"+
		"You wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night,\n"+
		"And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,\n"+
		"That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,\n"+
		"Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark,\n"+
		"To cry 'Hold, hold!'\n"+
		"Enter MACBETH\n"+
		"Great Glamis! worthy Cawdor!\n"+
		"Greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter!\n"+
		"Thy letters have transported me beyond\n"+
		"This ignorant present, and I feel now\n"+
		"The future in the instant.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"My dearest love,\n"+
		"Duncan comes here to-night.\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"And when goes hence?\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"To-morrow, as he purposes.\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"O, never\n"+
		"Shall sun that morrow see!\n"+
		"Your face, my thane, is as a book where men\n"+
		"May read strange matters. To beguile the time,\n"+
		"Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,\n"+
		"Your hand, your tongue: look like the innocent flower,\n"+
		"But be the serpent under't. He that's coming\n"+
		"Must be provided for: and you shall put\n"+
		"This night's great business into my dispatch;\n"+
		"Which shall to all our nights and days to come\n"+
		"Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"We will speak further.\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"Only look up clear;\n"+
		"To alter favour ever is to fear:\n"+
		"Leave all the rest to me.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE VI. Before Macbeth's castle.\n"+
		"Hautboys and torches. Enter DUNCAN, MALCOLM, DONALBAIN, BANQUO, LENNOX, MACDUFF, ROSS, ANGUS, and Attendants\n"+
		"DUNCAN\n"+
		"This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air\n"+
		"Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself\n"+
		"Unto our gentle senses.\n"+
		"BANQUO\n"+
		"This guest of summer,\n"+
		"The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,\n"+
		"By his loved mansionry, that the heaven's breath\n"+
		"Smells wooingly here: no jutty, frieze,\n"+
		"Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird\n"+
		"Hath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle:\n"+
		"Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed,\n"+
		"The air is delicate.\n"+
		"Enter LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"DUNCAN\n"+
		"See, see, our honour'd hostess!\n"+
		"The love that follows us sometime is our trouble,\n"+
		"Which still we thank as love. Herein I teach you\n"+
		"How you shall bid God 'ild us for your pains,\n"+
		"And thank us for your trouble.\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"All our service\n"+
		"In every point twice done and then done double\n"+
		"Were poor and single business to contend\n"+
		"Against those honours deep and broad wherewith\n"+
		"Your majesty loads our house: for those of old,\n"+
		"And the late dignities heap'd up to them,\n"+
		"We rest your hermits.\n"+
		"DUNCAN\n"+
		"Where's the thane of Cawdor?\n"+
		"We coursed him at the heels, and had a purpose\n"+
		"To be his purveyor: but he rides well;\n"+
		"And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp him\n"+

		"We are your guest to-night.\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"Your servants ever\n"+

		"To make their audit at your highness' pleasure,\n"+
		"Still to return your own.\n"+
		"DUNCAN\n"+
		"Give me your hand;\n"+

		"And shall continue our graces towards him.\n"+

		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE VII. Macbeth's castle.\n"+
		"Hautboys and torches. Enter a Sewer, and divers Servants with dishes and service, and pass over the stage. Then enter MACBETH\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well\n"+
		"It were done quickly: if the assassination\n"+
		"Could trammel up the consequence, and catch\n"+
		"With his surcease success; that but this blow\n"+
		"Might be the be-all and the end-all here,\n"+
		"But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,\n"+
		"We'ld jump the life to come. But in these cases\n"+
		"We still have judgment here; that we but teach\n"+
		"Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return\n"+
		"To plague the inventor: this even-handed justice\n"+
		"Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice\n"+
		"To our own lips. He's here in double trust;\n"+
		"First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,\n"+
		"Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,\n"+
		"Who should against his murderer shut the door,\n"+
		"Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan\n"+
		"Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been\n"+
		"So clear in his great office, that his virtues\n"+
		"Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against\n"+
		"The deep damnation of his taking-off;\n"+
		"And pity, like a naked new-born babe,\n"+
		"Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, horsed\n"+
		"Upon the sightless couriers of the air,\n"+
		"Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,\n"+
		"That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur\n"+
		"To prick the sides of my intent, but only\n"+
		"Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself\n"+
		"And falls on the other.\n"+
		"Enter LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"How now! what news?\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"He has almost supp'd: why have you left the chamber?\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Hath he ask'd for me?\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"Know you not he has?\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"We will proceed no further in this business:\n"+
		"He hath honour'd me of late; and I have bought\n"+
		"Golden opinions from all sorts of people,\n"+
		"Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,\n"+
		"Not cast aside so soon.\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"Was the hope drunk\n"+
		"Wherein you dress'd yourself? hath it slept since?\n"+
		"And wakes it now, to look so green and pale\n"+
		"At what it did so freely? From this time\n"+
		"Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard\n"+
		"To be the same in thine own act and valour\n"+
		"As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that\n"+
		"Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life,\n"+
		"And live a coward in thine own esteem,\n"+
		"Letting 'I dare not' wait upon 'I would,'\n"+
		"Like the poor cat i' the adage?\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Prithee, peace:\n"+
		"I dare do all that may become a man;\n"+
		"Who dares do more is none.\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"What beast was't, then,\n"+
		"That made you break this enterprise to me?\n"+
		"When you durst do it, then you were a man;\n"+
		"And, to be more than what you were, you would\n"+
		"Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place\n"+
		"Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:\n"+
		"They have made themselves, and that their fitness now\n"+
		"Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know\n"+
		"How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me:\n"+
		"I would, while it was smiling in my face,\n"+
		"Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums,\n"+
		"And dash'd the brains out, had I so sworn as you\n"+
		"Have done to this.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"If we should fail?\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"We fail!\n"+
		"But screw your courage to the sticking-place,\n"+
		"And we'll not fail. When Duncan is asleep--\n"+
		"Whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey\n"+
		"Soundly invite him--his two chamberlains\n"+
		"Will I with wine and wassail so convince\n"+
		"That memory, the warder of the brain,\n"+
		"Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason\n"+
		"A limbeck only: when in swinish sleep\n"+
		"Their drenched natures lie as in a death,\n"+
		"What cannot you and I perform upon\n"+
		"The unguarded Duncan? what not put upon\n"+
		"His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt\n"+
		"Of our great quell?\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Bring forth men-children only;\n"+
		"For thy undaunted mettle should compose\n"+
		"Nothing but males. Will it not be received,\n"+
		"When we have mark'd with blood those sleepy two\n"+
		"Of his own chamber and used their very daggers,\n"+
		"That they have done't?\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"Who dares receive it other,\n"+
		"As we shall make our griefs and clamour roar\n"+
		"Upon his death?\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"I am settled, and bend up\n"+
		"Each corporal agent to this terrible feat.\n"+
		"Away, and mock the time with fairest show:\n"+
		"False face must hide what the false heart doth know.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT II\n"+
		"SCENE I. Court of Macbeth's castle.\n"+
		"Enter BANQUO, and FLEANCE bearing a torch before him\n"+
		"BANQUO\n"+
		"How goes the night, boy?\n"+
		"FLEANCE\n"+
		"The moon is down; I have not heard the clock.\n"+
		"BANQUO\n"+
		"And she goes down at twelve.\n"+
		"FLEANCE\n"+
		"I take't, 'tis later, sir.\n"+
		"BANQUO\n"+
		"Hold, take my sword. There's husbandry in heaven;\n"+
		"Their candles are all out. Take thee that too.\n"+
		"A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,\n"+
		"And yet I would not sleep: merciful powers,\n"+
		"Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature\n"+
		"Gives way to in repose!\n"+
		"Enter MACBETH, and a Servant with a torch\n"+
		"Give me my sword.\n"+
		"Who's there?\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"A friend.\n"+
		"BANQUO\n"+
		"What, sir, not yet at rest? The king's a-bed:\n"+
		"He hath been in unusual pleasure, and\n"+
		"Sent forth great largess to your offices.\n"+
		"This diamond he greets your wife withal,\n"+
		"By the name of most kind hostess; and shut up\n"+
		"In measureless content.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Being unprepared,\n"+
		"Our will became the servant to defect;\n"+
		"Which else should free have wrought.\n"+
		"BANQUO\n"+
		"All's well.\n"+
		"I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters:\n"+
		"To you they have show'd some truth.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"I think not of them:\n"+
		"Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,\n"+
		"We would spend it in some words upon that business,\n"+
		"If you would grant the time.\n"+
		"BANQUO\n"+
		"At your kind'st leisure.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"If you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis,\n"+
		"It shall make honour for you.\n"+
		"BANQUO\n"+
		"So I lose none\n"+
		"In seeking to augment it, but still keep\n"+
		"My bosom franchised and allegiance clear,\n"+
		"I shall be counsell'd.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Good repose the while!\n"+
		"BANQUO\n"+
		"Thanks, sir: the like to you!\n"+
		"Exeunt BANQUO and FLEANCE\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,\n"+
		"She strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed.\n"+
		"Exit Servant\n"+
		"Is this a dagger which I see before me,\n"+
		"The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee.\n"+
		"I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.\n"+
		"Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible\n"+
		"To feeling as to sight? or art thou but\n"+
		"A dagger of the mind, a false creation,\n"+
		"Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?\n"+
		"I see thee yet, in form as palpable\n"+
		"As this which now I draw.\n"+
		"Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going;\n"+
		"And such an instrument I was to use.\n"+
		"Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses,\n"+
		"Or else worth all the rest; I see thee still,\n"+
		"And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,\n"+
		"Which was not so before. There's no such thing:\n"+
		"It is the bloody business which informs\n"+
		"Thus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one halfworld\n"+
		"Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse\n"+
		"The curtain'd sleep; witchcraft celebrates\n"+
		"Pale Hecate's offerings, and wither'd murder,\n"+
		"Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf,\n"+
		"Whose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace.\n"+
		"With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design\n"+
		"Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth,\n"+
		"Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear\n"+
		"Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,\n"+
		"And take the present horror from the time,\n"+
		"Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives:\n"+
		"Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.\n"+
		"A bell rings\n"+
		"I go, and it is done; the bell invites me.\n"+
		"Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell\n"+
		"That summons thee to heaven or to hell.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE II. The same.\n"+
		"Enter LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold;\n"+
		"What hath quench'd them hath given me fire.\n"+
		"Hark! Peace!\n"+
		"It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman,\n"+
		"Which gives the stern'st good-night. He is about it:\n"+
		"The doors are open; and the surfeited grooms\n"+
		"Do mock their charge with snores: I have drugg'd\n"+
		"their possets,\n"+
		"That death and nature do contend about them,\n"+
		"Whether they live or die.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"[Within] Who's there? what, ho!\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"Alack, I am afraid they have awaked,\n"+
		"And 'tis not done. The attempt and not the deed\n"+
		"Confounds us. Hark! I laid their daggers ready;\n"+
		"He could not miss 'em. Had he not resembled\n"+
		"My father as he slept, I had done't.\n"+
		"Enter MACBETH\n"+
		"My husband!\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"I have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a noise?\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.\n"+
		"Did not you speak?\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"When?\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"Now.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"As I descended?\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"Ay.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Hark!\n"+
		"Who lies i' the second chamber?\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"Donalbain.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"This is a sorry sight.\n"+
		"Looking on his hands\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"There's one did laugh in's sleep, and one cried\n"+
		"'Murder!'\n"+
		"That they did wake each other: I stood and heard them:\n"+
		"But they did say their prayers, and address'd them\n"+
		"Again to sleep.\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"There are two lodged together.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"One cried 'God bless us!' and 'Amen' the other;\n"+
		"As they had seen me with these hangman's hands.\n"+
		"Listening their fear, I could not say 'Amen,'\n"+
		"When they did say 'God bless us!'\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"Consider it not so deeply.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"But wherefore could not I pronounce 'Amen'?\n"+
		"I had most need of blessing, and 'Amen'\n"+
		"Stuck in my throat.\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"These deeds must not be thought\n"+
		"After these ways; so, it will make us mad.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Methought I heard a voice cry 'Sleep no more!\n"+
		"Macbeth does murder sleep', the innocent sleep,\n"+
		"Sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleeve of care,\n"+
		"The death of each day's life, sore labour's bath,\n"+
		"Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,\n"+
		"Chief nourisher in life's feast,--\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"What do you mean?\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Still it cried 'Sleep no more!' to all the house:\n"+
		"'Glamis hath murder'd sleep, and therefore Cawdor\n"+
		"Shall sleep no more; Macbeth shall sleep no more.'\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane,\n"+
		"You do unbend your noble strength, to think\n"+
		"So brainsickly of things. Go get some water,\n"+
		"And wash this filthy witness from your hand.\n"+
		"Why did you bring these daggers from the place?\n"+
		"They must lie there: go carry them; and smear\n"+
		"The sleepy grooms with blood.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"I'll go no more:\n"+
		"I am afraid to think what I have done;\n"+
		"Look on't again I dare not.\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"Infirm of purpose!\n"+
		"Give me the daggers: the sleeping and the dead\n"+
		"Are but as pictures: 'tis the eye of childhood\n"+
		"That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed,\n"+
		"I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal;\n"+
		"For it must seem their guilt.\n"+
		"Exit. Knocking within\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Whence is that knocking?\n"+
		"How is't with me, when every noise appals me?\n"+
		"What hands are here? ha! they pluck out mine eyes.\n"+
		"Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood\n"+
		"Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather\n"+
		"The multitudinous seas in incarnadine,\n"+
		"Making the green one red.\n"+
		"Re-enter LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"My hands are of your colour; but I shame\n"+
		"To wear a heart so white.\n"+
		"Knocking within\n"+
		"I hear a knocking\n"+
		"At the south entry: retire we to our chamber;\n"+
		"A little water clears us of this deed:\n"+
		"How easy is it, then! Your constancy\n"+
		"Hath left you unattended.\n"+
		"Knocking within\n"+
		"Hark! more knocking.\n"+
		"Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us,\n"+
		"And show us to be watchers. Be not lost\n"+
		"So poorly in your thoughts.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"To know my deed, 'twere best not know myself.\n"+
		"Knocking within\n"+
		"Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst!\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. The same.\n"+
		"Knocking within. Enter a Porter\n"+
		"Porter\n"+
		"Here's a knocking indeed! If a\n"+
		"man were porter of hell-gate, he should have\n"+
		"old turning the key.\n"+
		"Knocking within\n"+
		"Knock,\n"+
		"knock, knock! Who's there, i' the name of\n"+
		"Beelzebub? Here's a farmer, that hanged\n"+
		"himself on the expectation of plenty: come in\n"+
		"time; have napkins enow about you; here\n"+
		"you'll sweat for't.\n"+
		"Knocking within\n"+
		"Knock,\n"+
		"knock! Who's there, in the other devil's\n"+
		"name? Faith, here's an equivocator, that could\n"+
		"swear in both the scales against either scale;\n"+
		"who committed treason enough for God's sake,\n"+
		"yet could not equivocate to heaven: O, come\n"+
		"in, equivocator.\n"+
		"Knocking within\n"+
		"Knock,\n"+
		"knock, knock! Who's there? Faith, here's an\n"+
		"English tailor come hither, for stealing out of\n"+
		"a French hose: come in, tailor; here you may\n"+
		"roast your goose.\n"+
		"Knocking within\n"+
		"Knock,\n"+
		"knock; never at quiet! What are you? But\n"+
		"this place is too cold for hell. I'll devil-porter\n"+
		"it no further: I had thought to have let in\n"+
		"some of all professions that go the primrose\n"+
		"way to the everlasting bonfire.\n"+
		"Knocking within\n"+
		"Anon, anon! I pray you, remember the porter.\n"+
		"Opens the gate\n"+
		"Enter MACDUFF and LENNOX\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed,\n"+
		"That you do lie so late?\n"+
		"Porter\n"+
		"'Faith sir, we were carousing till the\n"+
		"second cock: and drink, sir, is a great\n"+
		"provoker of three things.\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"What three things does drink especially provoke?\n"+
		"Porter\n"+
		"Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and\n"+
		"urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes, and unprovokes;\n"+
		"it provokes the desire, but it takes\n"+
		"away the performance: therefore, much drink\n"+
		"may be said to be an equivocator with lechery:\n"+
		"it makes him, and it mars him; it sets\n"+
		"him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him,\n"+
		"and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and\n"+
		"not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him\n"+
		"in a sleep, and, giving him the lie, leaves him.\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.\n"+
		"Porter\n"+
		"That it did, sir, i' the very throat on\n"+
		"me: but I requited him for his lie; and, I\n"+
		"think, being too strong for him, though he took\n"+
		"up my legs sometime, yet I made a shift to cast\n"+
		"him.\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"Is thy master stirring?\n"+
		"Enter MACBETH\n"+
		"Our knocking has awaked him; here he comes.\n"+
		"LENNOX\n"+
		"Good morrow, noble sir.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Good morrow, both.\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"Is the king stirring, worthy thane?\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Not yet.\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"He did command me to call timely on him:\n"+
		"I have almost slipp'd the hour.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"I'll bring you to him.\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"I know this is a joyful trouble to you;\n"+
		"But yet 'tis one.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"The labour we delight in physics pain.\n"+
		"This is the door.\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"I'll make so bold to call,\n"+
		"For 'tis my limited service.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"LENNOX\n"+
		"Goes the king hence to-day?\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"He does: he did appoint so.\n"+
		"LENNOX\n"+
		"The night has been unruly: where we lay,\n"+
		"Our chimneys were blown down; and, as they say,\n"+
		"Lamentings heard i' the air; strange screams of death,\n"+
		"And prophesying with accents terrible\n"+
		"Of dire combustion and confused events\n"+
		"New hatch'd to the woeful time: the obscure bird\n"+
		"Clamour'd the livelong night: some say, the earth\n"+
		"Was feverous and did shake.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"'Twas a rough night.\n"+
		"LENNOX\n"+
		"My young remembrance cannot parallel\n"+
		"A fellow to it.\n"+
		"Re-enter MACDUFF\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"O horror, horror, horror! Tongue nor heart\n"+
		"Cannot conceive nor name thee!\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"LENNOX\n"+
		"What's the matter.\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"Confusion now hath made his masterpiece!\n"+
		"Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope\n"+
		"The Lord's anointed temple, and stole thence\n"+
		"The life o' the building!\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"What is 't you say? the life?\n"+
		"LENNOX\n"+
		"Mean you his majesty?\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight\n"+
		"With a new Gorgon: do not bid me speak;\n"+
		"See, and then speak yourselves.\n"+
		"Exeunt MACBETH and LENNOX\n"+
		"Awake, awake!\n"+
		"Ring the alarum-bell. Murder and treason!\n"+
		"Banquo and Donalbain! Malcolm! awake!\n"+
		"Shake off this downy sleep, death's counterfeit,\n"+
		"And look on death itself! up, up, and see\n"+
		"The great doom's image! Malcolm! Banquo!\n"+
		"As from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites,\n"+
		"To countenance this horror! Ring the bell.\n"+
		"Bell rings\n"+
		"Enter LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"What's the business,\n"+
		"That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley\n"+
		"The sleepers of the house? speak, speak!\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"O gentle lady,\n"+
		"'Tis not for you to hear what I can speak:\n"+
		"The repetition, in a woman's ear,\n"+
		"Would murder as it fell.\n"+
		"Enter BANQUO\n"+
		"O Banquo, Banquo,\n"+
		"Our royal master 's murder'd!\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"Woe, alas!\n"+
		"What, in our house?\n"+
		"BANQUO\n"+
		"Too cruel any where.\n"+
		"Dear Duff, I prithee, contradict thyself,\n"+
		"And say it is not so.\n"+
		"Re-enter MACBETH and LENNOX, with ROSS\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Had I but died an hour before this chance,\n"+
		"I had lived a blessed time; for, from this instant,\n"+
		"There 's nothing serious in mortality:\n"+
		"All is but toys: renown and grace is dead;\n"+
		"The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees\n"+
		"Is left this vault to brag of.\n"+
		"Enter MALCOLM and DONALBAIN\n"+
		"DONALBAIN\n"+
		"What is amiss?\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"You are, and do not know't:\n"+
		"The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood\n"+
		"Is stopp'd; the very source of it is stopp'd.\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"Your royal father 's murder'd.\n"+
		"MALCOLM\n"+
		"O, by whom?\n"+
		"LENNOX\n"+
		"Those of his chamber, as it seem'd, had done 't:\n"+
		"Their hands and faces were an badged with blood;\n"+
		"So were their daggers, which unwiped we found\n"+
		"Upon their pillows:\n"+
		"They stared, and were distracted; no man's life\n"+
		"Was to be trusted with them.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"O, yet I do repent me of my fury,\n"+
		"That I did kill them.\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"Wherefore did you so?\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Who can be wise, amazed, temperate and furious,\n"+
		"Loyal and neutral, in a moment? No man:\n"+
		"The expedition my violent love\n"+
		"Outrun the pauser, reason. Here lay Duncan,\n"+
		"His silver skin laced with his golden blood;\n"+
		"And his gash'd stabs look'd like a breach in nature\n"+
		"For ruin's wasteful entrance: there, the murderers,\n"+
		"Steep'd in the colours of their trade, their daggers\n"+
		"Unmannerly breech'd with gore: who could refrain,\n"+
		"That had a heart to love, and in that heart\n"+
		"Courage to make 's love kno wn?\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"Help me hence, ho!\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"Look to the lady.\n"+
		"MALCOLM\n"+
		"[Aside to DONALBAIN] Why do we hold our tongues,\n"+
		"That most may claim this argument for ours?\n"+
		"DONALBAIN\n"+
		"[Aside to MALCOLM] What should be spoken here,\n"+

		"Look to the lady:\n"+

		"And when we have our naked frailties hid,\n"+
		"That suffer in exposure, let us meet,\n"+
		"And question this most bloody piece of work,\n"+
		"To know it further. Fears and scruples shake us:\n"+
		"In the great hand of God I stand; and thence\n"+
		"Against the undivulged pretence I fight\n"+
		"Of treasonous malice.\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"And so do I.\n"+
		"ALL\n"+
		"So all.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Let's briefly put on manly readiness,\n"+
		"And meet i' the hall together.\n"+
		"ALL\n"+
		"Well contented.\n"+
		"Exeunt all but Malcolm and Donalbain.\n"+
		"MALCOLM\n"+
		"What will you do? Let's not consort with them:\n"+
		"To show an unfelt sorrow is an office\n"+
		"Which the false man does easy. I'll to England.\n"+
		"DONALBAIN\n"+
		"To Ireland, I; our separated fortune\n"+
		"Shall keep us both the safer: where we are,\n"+
		"There's daggers in men's smiles: the near in blood,\n"+
		"The nearer bloody.\n"+
		"MALCOLM\n"+
		"This murderous shaft that's shot\n"+
		"Hath not yet lighted, and our safest way\n"+
		"Is to avoid the aim. Therefore, to horse;\n"+
		"And let us not be dainty of leave-taking,\n"+
		"But shift away: there's warrant in that theft\n"+
		"Which steals itself, when there's no mercy left.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV. Outside Macbeth's castle.\n"+
		"Enter ROSS and an old Man\n"+
		"Old Man\n"+
		"Threescore and ten I can remember well:\n"+
		"Within the volume of which time I have seen\n"+
		"Hours dreadful and things strange; but this sore night\n"+
		"Hath trifled former knowings.\n"+
		"ROSS\n"+
		"Ah, good father,\n"+
		"Thou seest, the heavens, as troubled with man's act,\n"+
		"Threaten his bloody stage: by the clock, 'tis day,\n"+
		"And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp:\n"+
		"Is't night's predominance, or the day's shame,\n"+
		"That darkness does the face of earth entomb,\n"+
		"When living light should kiss it?\n"+
		"Old Man\n"+
		"'Tis unnatural,\n"+
		"Even like the deed that's done. On Tuesday last,\n"+
		"A falcon, towering in her pride of place,\n"+
		"Was by a mousing owl hawk'd at and kill'd.\n"+
		"ROSS\n"+
		"And Duncan's horses--a thing most strange and certain--\n"+
		"Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race,\n"+
		"Turn'd wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out,\n"+
		"Contending 'gainst obedience, as they would make\n"+
		"War with mankind.\n"+
		"Old Man\n"+
		"'Tis said they eat each other.\n"+
		"ROSS\n"+
		"They did so, to the amazement of mine eyes\n"+
		"That look'd upon't. Here comes the good Macduff.\n"+
		"Enter MACDUFF\n"+
		"How goes the world, sir, now?\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"Why, see you not?\n"+
		"ROSS\n"+
		"Is't known who did this more than bloody deed?\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"Those that Macbeth hath slain.\n"+
		"ROSS\n"+
		"Alas, the day!\n"+
		"What good could they pretend?\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"They were suborn'd:\n"+
		"Malcolm and Donalbain, the king's two sons,\n"+
		"Are stol'n away and fled; which puts upon them\n"+
		"Suspicion of the deed.\n"+
		"ROSS\n"+
		"'Gainst nature still!\n"+
		"Thriftless ambition, that wilt ravin up\n"+
		"Thine own life's means! Then 'tis most like\n"+
		"The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"He is already named, and gone to Scone\n"+
		"To be invested.\n"+
		"ROSS\n"+
		"Where is Duncan's body?\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"Carried to Colmekill,\n"+
		"The sacred storehouse of his predecessors,\n"+
		"And guardian of their bones.\n"+
		"ROSS\n"+
		"Will you to Scone?\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"No, cousin, I'll to Fife.\n"+
		"ROSS\n"+
		"Well, I will thither.\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"Well, may you see things well done there: adieu!\n"+
		"Lest our old robes sit easier than our new!\n"+
		"ROSS\n"+
		"Farewell, father.\n"+
		"Old Man\n"+
		"God's benison go with you; and with those\n"+
		"That would make good of bad, and friends of foes!\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT III\n"+
		"SCENE I. Forres. The palace.\n"+
		"Enter BANQUO\n"+
		"BANQUO\n"+
		"Thou hast it now: king, Cawdor, Glamis, all,\n"+
		"As the weird women promised, and, I fear,\n"+
		"Thou play'dst most foully for't: yet it was said\n"+
		"It should not stand in thy posterity,\n"+
		"But that myself should be the root and father\n"+
		"Of many kings. If there come truth from them--\n"+
		"As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine--\n"+
		"Why, by the verities on thee made good,\n"+
		"May they not be my oracles as well,\n"+
		"And set me up in hope? But hush! no more.\n"+
		"Sennet sounded. Enter MACBETH, as king, LADY MACBETH, as queen, LENNOX, ROSS, Lords, Ladies, and Attendants\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Here's our chief guest.\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"If he had been forgotten,\n"+
		"It had been as a gap in our great feast,\n"+
		"And all-thing unbecoming.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"To-night we hold a solemn supper sir,\n"+
		"And I'll request your presence.\n"+
		"BANQUO\n"+
		"Let your highness\n"+
		"Command upon me; to the which my duties\n"+
		"Are with a most indissoluble tie\n"+
		"For ever knit.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Ride you this afternoon?\n"+
		"BANQUO\n"+
		"Ay, my good lord.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"We should have else desired your good advice,\n"+
		"Which still hath been both grave and prosperous,\n"+
		"In this day's council; but we'll take to-morrow.\n"+
		"Is't far you ride?\n"+
		"BANQUO\n"+
		"As far, my lord, as will fill up the time\n"+
		"'Twixt this and supper: go not my horse the better,\n"+
		"I must become a borrower of the night\n"+
		"For a dark hour or twain.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Fail not our feast.\n"+
		"BANQUO\n"+
		"My lord, I will not.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"We hear, our bloody cousins are bestow'd\n"+
		"In England and in Ireland, not confessing\n"+
		"Their cruel parricide, filling their hearers\n"+
		"With strange invention: but of that to-morrow,\n"+
		"When therewithal we shall have cause of state\n"+
		"Craving us jointly. Hie you to horse: adieu,\n"+
		"Till you return at night. Goes Fleance with you?\n"+
		"BANQUO\n"+
		"Ay, my good lord: our time does call upon 's.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"I wish your horses swift and sure of foot;\n"+
		"And so I do commend you to their backs. Farewell.\n"+
		"Exit BANQUO\n"+
		"Let every man be master of his time\n"+
		"Till seven at night: to make society\n"+
		"The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself\n"+
		"Till supper-time alone: while then, God be with you!\n"+
		"Exeunt all but MACBETH, and an attendant\n"+
		"Sirrah, a word with you: attend those men\n"+
		"Our pleasure?\n"+
		"ATTENDANT\n"+
		"They are, my lord, without the palace gate.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Bring them before us.\n"+
		"Exit Attendant\n"+
		"To be thus is nothing;\n"+
		"But to be safely thus.--Our fears in Banquo\n"+
		"Stick deep; and in his royalty of nature\n"+
		"Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares;\n"+
		"And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,\n"+
		"He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour\n"+
		"To act in safety. There is none but he\n"+
		"Whose being I do fear: and, under him,\n"+
		"My Genius is rebuked; as, it is said,\n"+
		"Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters\n"+
		"When first they put the name of king upon me,\n"+
		"And bade them speak to him: then prophet-like\n"+
		"They hail'd him father to a line of kings:\n"+
		"Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,\n"+
		"And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,\n"+
		"Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,\n"+
		"No son of mine succeeding. If 't be so,\n"+
		"For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind;\n"+
		"For them the gracious Duncan have I murder'd;\n"+
		"Put rancours in the vessel of my peace\n"+
		"Only for them; and mine eternal jewel\n"+
		"Given to the common enemy of man,\n"+
		"To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!\n"+
		"Rather than so, come fate into the list.\n"+
		"And champion me to the utterance! Who's there!\n"+
		"Re-enter Attendant, with two Murderers\n"+
		"Now go to the door, and stay there till we call.\n"+
		"Exit Attendant\n"+
		"Was it not yesterday we spoke together?\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"It was, so please your highness.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Well then, now\n"+
		"Have you consider'd of my speeches? Know\n"+
		"That it was he in the times past which held you\n"+
		"So under fortune, which you thought had been\n"+
		"Our innocent self: this I made good to you\n"+
		"In our last conference, pass'd in probation with you,\n"+
		"How you were borne in hand, how cross'd,\n"+
		"the instruments,\n"+
		"Who wrought with them, and all things else that might\n"+
		"To half a soul and to a notion crazed\n"+
		"Say 'Thus did Banquo.'\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"You made it known to us.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"I did so, and went further, which is now\n"+
		"Our point of second meeting. Do you find\n"+
		"Your patience so predominant in your nature\n"+
		"That you can let this go? Are you so gospell'd\n"+
		"To pray for this good man and for his issue,\n"+
		"Whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave\n"+
		"And beggar'd yours for ever?\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"We are men, my liege.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men;\n"+
		"As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,\n"+
		"Shoughs, water-rugs and demi-wolves, are clept\n"+
		"All by the name of dogs: the valued file\n"+
		"Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,\n"+
		"The housekeeper, the hunter, every one\n"+
		"According to the gift which bounteous nature\n"+
		"Hath in him closed; whereby he does receive\n"+
		"Particular addition. from the bill\n"+
		"That writes them all alike: and so of men.\n"+
		"Now, if you have a station in the file,\n"+
		"Not i' the worst rank of manhood, say 't;\n"+
		"And I will put that business in your bosoms,\n"+
		"Whose execution takes your enemy off,\n"+
		"Grapples you to the heart and love of us,\n"+
		"Who wear our health but sickly in his life,\n"+
		"Which in his death were perfect.\n"+
		"Second Murderer\n"+
		"I am one, my liege,\n"+
		"Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world\n"+
		"Have so incensed that I am reckless what\n"+
		"I do to spite the world.\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"And I another\n"+
		"So weary with disasters, tugg'd with fortune,\n"+
		"That I would set my lie on any chance,\n"+
		"To mend it, or be rid on't.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Both of you\n"+
		"Know Banquo was your enemy.\n"+
		"Both Murderers\n"+
		"True, my lord.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"So is he mine; and in such bloody distance,\n"+
		"That every minute of his being thrusts\n"+
		"Against my near'st of life: and though I could\n"+
		"With barefaced power sweep him from my sight\n"+
		"And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,\n"+
		"For certain friends that are both his and mine,\n"+
		"Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall\n"+
		"Who I myself struck down; and thence it is,\n"+
		"That I to your assistance do make love,\n"+
		"Masking the business from the common eye\n"+
		"For sundry weighty reasons.\n"+
		"Second Murderer\n"+
		"We shall, my lord,\n"+
		"Perform what you command us.\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"Though our lives--\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most\n"+
		"I will advise you where to plant yourselves;\n"+
		"Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time,\n"+
		"The moment on't; for't must be done to-night,\n"+
		"And something from the palace; always thought\n"+
		"That I require a clearness: and with him--\n"+
		"To leave no rubs nor botches in the work--\n"+
		"Fleance his son, that keeps him company,\n"+
		"Whose absence is no less material to me\n"+
		"Than is his father's, must embrace the fate\n"+
		"Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart:\n"+
		"I'll come to you anon.\n"+
		"Both Murderers\n"+
		"We are resolved, my lord.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"I'll call upon you straight: abide within.\n"+
		"Exeunt Murderers\n"+
		"It is concluded. Banquo, thy soul's flight,\n"+
		"If it find heaven, must find it out to-night.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE II. The palace.\n"+
		"Enter LADY MACBETH and a Servant\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"Is Banquo gone from court?\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"Ay, madam, but returns again to-night.\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"Say to the king, I would attend his leisure\n"+
		"For a few words.\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"Madam, I will.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"Nought's had, all's spent,\n"+
		"Where our desire is got without content:\n"+
		"'Tis safer to be that which we destroy\n"+
		"Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.\n"+
		"Enter MACBETH\n"+
		"How now, my lord! why do you keep alone,\n"+
		"Of sorriest fancies your companions making,\n"+
		"Using those thoughts which should indeed have died\n"+
		"With them they think on? Things without all remedy\n"+
		"Should be without regard: what's done is done.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"We have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it:\n"+
		"She'll close and be herself, whilst our poor malice\n"+
		"Remains in danger of her former tooth.\n"+
		"But let the frame of things disjoint, both the\n"+
		"worlds suffer,\n"+
		"Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep\n"+
		"In the affliction of these terrible dreams\n"+
		"That shake us nightly: better be with the dead,\n"+
		"Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,\n"+
		"Than on the torture of the mind to lie\n"+
		"In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;\n"+
		"After life's fitful fever he sleeps well;\n"+
		"Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,\n"+
		"Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,\n"+
		"Can touch him further.\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"Come on;\n"+
		"Gentle my lord, sleek o'er your rugged looks;\n"+
		"Be bright and jovial among your guests to-night.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"So shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you:\n"+
		"Let your remembrance apply to Banquo;\n"+
		"Present him eminence, both with eye and tongue:\n"+
		"Unsafe the while, that we\n"+
		"Must lave our honours in these flattering streams,\n"+
		"And make our faces vizards to our hearts,\n"+
		"Disguising what they are.\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"You must leave this.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!\n"+
		"Thou know'st that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives.\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"But in them nature's copy's not eterne.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"There's comfort yet; they are assailable;\n"+
		"Then be thou jocund: ere the bat hath flown\n"+
		"His cloister'd flight, ere to black Hecate's summons\n"+
		"The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums\n"+
		"Hath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be done\n"+
		"A deed of dreadful note.\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"What's to be done?\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,\n"+
		"Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,\n"+
		"Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day;\n"+
		"And with thy bloody and invisible hand\n"+
		"Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond\n"+
		"Which keeps me pale! Light thickens; and the crow\n"+
		"Makes wing to the rooky wood:\n"+
		"Good things of day begin to droop and drowse;\n"+
		"While night's black agents to their preys do rouse.\n"+
		"Thou marvell'st at my words: but hold thee still;\n"+
		"Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.\n"+
		"So, prithee, go with me.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. A park near the palace.\n"+
		"Enter three Murderers\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"But who did bid thee join with us?\n"+
		"Third Murderer\n"+
		"Macbeth.\n"+
		"Second Murderer\n"+
		"He needs not our mistrust, since he delivers\n"+
		"Our offices and what we have to do\n"+
		"To the direction just.\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"Then stand with us.\n"+
		"The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day:\n"+
		"Now spurs the lated traveller apace\n"+
		"To gain the timely inn; and near approaches\n"+
		"The subject of our watch.\n"+
		"Third Murderer\n"+
		"Hark! I hear horses.\n"+
		"BANQUO\n"+
		"[Within] Give us a light there, ho!\n"+
		"Second Murderer\n"+
		"Then 'tis he: the rest\n"+
		"That are within the note of expectation\n"+
		"Already are i' the court.\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"His horses go about.\n"+
		"Third Murderer\n"+
		"Almost a mile: but he does usually,\n"+
		"So all men do, from hence to the palace gate\n"+
		"Make it their walk.\n"+
		"Second Murderer\n"+
		"A light, a light!\n"+
		"Enter BANQUO, and FLEANCE with a torch\n"+
		"Third Murderer\n"+
		"'Tis he.\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"Stand to't.\n"+
		"BANQUO\n"+
		"It will be rain to-night.\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"Let it come down.\n"+
		"They set upon BANQUO\n"+
		"BANQUO\n"+
		"O, treachery! Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!\n"+
		"Thou mayst revenge. O slave!\n"+
		"Dies. FLEANCE escapes\n"+
		"Third Murderer\n"+
		"Who did strike out the light?\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"Wast not the way?\n"+
		"Third Murderer\n"+
		"There's but one down; the son is fled.\n"+
		"Second Murderer\n"+
		"We have lost\n"+
		"Best half of our affair.\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"Well, let's away, and say how much is done.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV. The same. Hall in the palace.\n"+
		"A banquet prepared. Enter MACBETH, LADY MACBETH, ROSS, LENNOX, Lords, and Attendants\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"You know your own degrees; sit down: at first\n"+
		"And last the hearty welcome.\n"+
		"Lords\n"+
		"Thanks to your majesty.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Ourself will mingle with society,\n"+
		"And play the humble host.\n"+
		"Our hostess keeps her state, but in best time\n"+
		"We will require her welcome.\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends;\n"+
		"For my heart speaks they are welcome.\n"+
		"First Murderer appears at the door\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"See, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks.\n"+
		"Both sides are even: here I'll sit i' the midst:\n"+
		"Be large in mirth; anon we'll drink a measure\n"+
		"The table round.\n"+
		"Approaching the door\n"+
		"There's blood on thy face.\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"'Tis Banquo's then.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"'Tis better thee without than he within.\n"+
		"Is he dispatch'd?\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"My lord, his throat is cut; that I did for him.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Thou art the best o' the cut-throats: yet he's good\n"+
		"That did the like for Fleance: if thou didst it,\n"+
		"Thou art the nonpareil.\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"Most royal sir,\n"+
		"Fleance is 'scaped.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Then comes my fit again: I had else been perfect,\n"+
		"Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,\n"+
		"As broad and general as the casing air:\n"+
		"But now I am cabin'd, cribb'd, confined, bound in\n"+
		"To saucy doubts and fears. But Banquo's safe?\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"Ay, my good lord: safe in a ditch he bides,\n"+
		"With twenty trenched gashes on his head;\n"+
		"The least a death to nature.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Thanks for that:\n"+
		"There the grown serpent lies; the worm that's fled\n"+
		"Hath nature that in time will venom breed,\n"+
		"No teeth for the present. Get thee gone: to-morrow\n"+
		"We'll hear, ourselves, again.\n"+
		"Exit Murderer\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"My royal lord,\n"+
		"You do not give the cheer: the feast is sold\n"+
		"That is not often vouch'd, while 'tis a-making,\n"+
		"'Tis given with welcome: to feed were best at home;\n"+
		"From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony;\n"+
		"Meeting were bare without it.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Sweet remembrancer!\n"+
		"Now, good digestion wait on appetite,\n"+
		"And health on both!\n"+
		"LENNOX\n"+
		"May't please your highness sit.\n"+
		"The GHOST OF BANQUO enters, and sits in MACBETH's place\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Here had we now our country's honour roof'd,\n"+
		"Were the graced person of our Banquo present;\n"+
		"Who may I rather challenge for unkindness\n"+
		"Than pity for mischance!\n"+
		"ROSS\n"+
		"His absence, sir,\n"+
		"Lays blame upon his promise. Please't your highness\n"+
		"To grace us with your royal company.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"The table's full.\n"+
		"LENNOX\n"+
		"Here is a place reserved, sir.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Where?\n"+
		"LENNOX\n"+
		"Here, my good lord. What is't that moves your highness?\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Which of you have done this?\n"+
		"Lords\n"+
		"What, my good lord?\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Thou canst not say I did it: never shake\n"+
		"Thy gory locks at me.\n"+
		"ROSS\n"+
		"Gentlemen, rise: his highness is not well.\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"Sit, worthy friends: my lord is often thus,\n"+
		"And hath been from his youth: pray you, keep seat;\n"+
		"The fit is momentary; upon a thought\n"+
		"He will again be well: if much you note him,\n"+
		"You shall offend him and extend his passion:\n"+
		"Feed, and regard him not. Are you a man?\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that\n"+
		"Which might appal the devil.\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"O proper stuff!\n"+
		"This is the very painting of your fear:\n"+
		"This is the air-drawn dagger which, you said,\n"+
		"Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts,\n"+
		"Impostors to true fear, would well become\n"+
		"A woman's story at a winter's fire,\n"+
		"Authorized by her grandam. Shame itself!\n"+
		"Why do you make such faces? When all's done,\n"+
		"You look but on a stool.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Prithee, see there! behold! look! lo!\n"+
		"how say you?\n"+
		"Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too.\n"+
		"If charnel-houses and our graves must send\n"+
		"Those that we bury back, our monuments\n"+
		"Shall be the maws of kites.\n"+
		"GHOST OF BANQUO vanishes\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"What, quite unmann'd in folly?\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"If I stand here, I saw him.\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"Fie, for shame!\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Blood hath been shed ere now, i' the olden time,\n"+
		"Ere human statute purged the gentle weal;\n"+
		"Ay, and since too, murders have been perform'd\n"+
		"Too terrible for the ear: the times have been,\n"+
		"That, when the brains were out, the man would die,\n"+
		"And there an end; but now they rise again,\n"+
		"With twenty mortal murders on their crowns,\n"+
		"And push us from our stools: this is more strange\n"+
		"Than such a murder is.\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"My worthy lord,\n"+
		"Your noble friends do lack you.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"I do forget.\n"+
		"Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends,\n"+
		"I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing\n"+
		"To those that know me. Come, love and health to all;\n"+
		"Then I'll sit down. Give me some wine; fill full.\n"+
		"I drink to the general joy o' the whole table,\n"+
		"And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss;\n"+
		"Would he were here! to all, and him, we thirst,\n"+
		"And all to all.\n"+
		"Lords\n"+
		"Our duties, and the pledge.\n"+
		"Re-enter GHOST OF BANQUO\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Avaunt! and quit my sight! let the earth hide thee!\n"+
		"Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold;\n"+
		"Thou hast no speculation in those eyes\n"+
		"Which thou dost glare with!\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"Think of this, good peers,\n"+
		"But as a thing of custom: 'tis no other;\n"+
		"Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"What man dare, I dare:\n"+
		"Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear,\n"+
		"The arm'd rhinoceros, or the Hyrcan tiger;\n"+
		"Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves\n"+
		"Shall never tremble: or be alive again,\n"+
		"And dare me to the desert with thy sword;\n"+
		"If trembling I inhabit then, protest me\n"+
		"The baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow!\n"+
		"Unreal mockery, hence!\n"+
		"GHOST OF BANQUO vanishes\n"+
		"Why, so: being gone,\n"+
		"I am a man again. Pray you, sit still.\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"You have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting,\n"+
		"With most admired disorder.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Can such things be,\n"+
		"And overcome us like a summer's cloud,\n"+
		"Without our special wonder? You make me strange\n"+
		"Even to the disposition that I owe,\n"+
		"When now I think you can behold such sights,\n"+
		"And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks,\n"+
		"When mine is blanched with fear.\n"+
		"ROSS\n"+
		"What sights, my lord?\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"I pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse;\n"+
		"Question enrages him. At once, good night:\n"+
		"Stand not upon the order of your going,\n"+
		"But go at once.\n"+
		"LENNOX\n"+
		"Good night; and better health\n"+
		"Attend his majesty!\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"A kind good night to all!\n"+
		"Exeunt all but MACBETH and LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"It will have blood; they say, blood will have blood:\n"+
		"Stones have been known to move and trees to speak;\n"+
		"Augurs and understood relations have\n"+
		"By magot-pies and choughs and rooks brought forth\n"+
		"The secret'st man of blood. What is the night?\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"Almost at odds with morning, which is which.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"How say'st thou, that Macduff denies his person\n"+
		"At our great bidding?\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"Did you send to him, sir?\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"I hear it by the way; but I will send:\n"+
		"There's not a one of them but in his house\n"+
		"I keep a servant fee'd. I will to-morrow,\n"+
		"And betimes I will, to the weird sisters:\n"+
		"More shall they speak; for now I am bent to know,\n"+
		"By the worst means, the worst. For mine own good,\n"+
		"All causes shall give way: I am in blood\n"+
		"Stepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more,\n"+
		"Returning were as tedious as go o'er:\n"+
		"Strange things I have in head, that will to hand;\n"+
		"Which must be acted ere they may be scann'd.\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"You lack the season of all natures, sleep.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Come, we'll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse\n"+
		"Is the initiate fear that wants hard use:\n"+
		"We are yet but young in deed.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE V. A Heath.\n"+
		"Thunder. Enter the three Witches meeting HECATE\n"+
		"First Witch\n"+
		"Why, how now, Hecate! you look angerly.\n"+
		"HECATE\n"+
		"Have I not reason, beldams as you are,\n"+
		"Saucy and overbold? How did you dare\n"+
		"To trade and traffic with Macbeth\n"+
		"In riddles and affairs of death;\n"+
		"And I, the mistress of your charms,\n"+
		"The close contriver of all harms,\n"+
		"Was never call'd to bear my part,\n"+
		"Or show the glory of our art?\n"+
		"And, which is worse, all you have done\n"+
		"Hath been but for a wayward son,\n"+
		"Spiteful and wrathful, who, as others do,\n"+
		"Loves for his own ends, not for you.\n"+
		"But make amends now: get you gone,\n"+
		"And at the pit of Acheron\n"+
		"Meet me i' the morning: thither he\n"+
		"Will come to know his destiny:\n"+
		"Your vessels and your spells provide,\n"+
		"Your charms and every thing beside.\n"+
		"I am for the air; this night I'll spend\n"+
		"Unto a dismal and a fatal end:\n"+
		"Great business must be wrought ere noon:\n"+
		"Upon the corner of the moon\n"+
		"There hangs a vaporous drop profound;\n"+
		"I'll catch it ere it come to ground:\n"+
		"And that distill'd by magic sleights\n"+
		"Shall raise such artificial sprites\n"+
		"As by the strength of their illusion\n"+
		"Shall draw him on to his confusion:\n"+
		"He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear\n"+
		"He hopes 'bove wisdom, grace and fear:\n"+
		"And you all know, security\n"+
		"Is mortals' chiefest enemy.\n"+
		"Music and a song within: 'Come away, come away,' & c\n"+
		"Hark! I am call'd; my little spirit, see,\n"+
		"Sits in a foggy cloud, and stays for me.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"First Witch\n"+
		"Come, let's make haste; she'll soon be back again.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE VI. Forres. The palace.\n"+
		"Enter LENNOX and another Lord\n"+
		"LENNOX\n"+
		"My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,\n"+
		"Which can interpret further: only, I say,\n"+
		"Things have been strangely borne. The\n"+
		"gracious Duncan\n"+
		"Was pitied of Macbeth: marry, he was dead:\n"+
		"And the right-valiant Banquo walk'd too late;\n"+
		"Whom, you may say, if't please you, Fleance kill'd,\n"+
		"For Fleance fled: men must not walk too late.\n"+
		"Who cannot want the thought how monstrous\n"+
		"It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain\n"+
		"To kill their gracious father? damned fact!\n"+
		"How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight\n"+
		"In pious rage the two delinquents tear,\n"+
		"That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?\n"+
		"Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too;\n"+
		"For 'twould have anger'd any heart alive\n"+
		"To hear the men deny't. So that, I say,\n"+
		"He has borne all things well: and I do think\n"+
		"That had he Duncan's sons under his key--\n"+
		"As, an't please heaven, he shall not--they\n"+
		"should find\n"+
		"What 'twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.\n"+
		"But, peace! for from broad words and 'cause he fail'd\n"+
		"His presence at the tyrant's feast, I hear\n"+
		"Macduff lives in disgrace: sir, can you tell\n"+
		"Where he bestows himself?\n"+
		"Lord\n"+
		"The son of Duncan,\n"+
		"From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth\n"+
		"Lives in the English court, and is received\n"+
		"Of the most pious Edward with such grace\n"+
		"That the malevolence of fortune nothing\n"+
		"Takes from his high respect: thither Macduff\n"+
		"Is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid\n"+
		"To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward:\n"+
		"That, by the help of these--with Him above\n"+
		"To ratify the work--we may again\n"+
		"Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights,\n"+
		"Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,\n"+
		"Do faithful homage and receive free honours:\n"+
		"All which we pine for now: and this report\n"+
		"Hath so exasperate the king that he\n"+
		"Prepares for some attempt of war.\n"+
		"LENNOX\n"+
		"Sent he to Macduff?\n"+
		"Lord\n"+
		"He did: and with an absolute 'Sir, not I,'\n"+
		"The cloudy messenger turns me his back,\n"+
		"And hums, as who should say 'You'll rue the time\n"+
		"That clogs me with this answer.'\n"+
		"LENNOX\n"+
		"And that well might\n"+
		"Advise him to a caution, to hold what distance\n"+
		"His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel\n"+
		"Fly to the court of England and unfold\n"+
		"His message ere he come, that a swift blessing\n"+
		"May soon return to this our suffering country\n"+
		"Under a hand accursed!\n"+
		"Lord\n"+
		"I'll send my prayers with him.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT IV\n"+
		"SCENE I. A cavern. In the middle, a boiling cauldron.\n"+
		"Thunder. Enter the three Witches\n"+
		"First Witch\n"+
		"Thrice the brinded cat hath mew'd.\n"+
		"Second Witch\n"+
		"Thrice and once the hedge-pig whined.\n"+
		"Third Witch\n"+
		"Harpier cries 'Tis time, 'tis time.\n"+
		"First Witch\n"+
		"Round about the cauldron go;\n"+
		"In the poison'd entrails throw.\n"+
		"Toad, that under cold stone\n"+
		"Days and nights has thirty-one\n"+
		"Swelter'd venom sleeping got,\n"+
		"Boil thou first i' the charmed pot.\n"+
		"ALL\n"+
		"Double, double toil and trouble;\n"+
		"Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.\n"+
		"Second Witch\n"+
		"Fillet of a fenny snake,\n"+
		"In the cauldron boil and bake;\n"+
		"Eye of newt and toe of frog,\n"+
		"Wool of bat and tongue of dog,\n"+
		"Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting,\n"+
		"Lizard's leg and owlet's wing,\n"+
		"For a charm of powerful trouble,\n"+
		"Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.\n"+
		"ALL\n"+
		"Double, double toil and trouble;\n"+
		"Fire burn and cauldron bubble.\n"+
		"Third Witch\n"+
		"Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf,\n"+
		"Witches' mummy, maw and gulf\n"+
		"Of the ravin'd salt-sea shark,\n"+
		"Root of hemlock digg'd i' the dark,\n"+
		"Liver of blaspheming Jew,\n"+
		"Gall of goat, and slips of yew\n"+
		"Silver'd in the moon's eclipse,\n"+
		"Nose of Turk and Tartar's lips,\n"+
		"Finger of birth-strangled babe\n"+
		"Ditch-deliver'd by a drab,\n"+
		"Make the gruel thick and slab:\n"+
		"Add thereto a tiger's chaudron,\n"+
		"For the ingredients of our cauldron.\n"+
		"ALL\n"+
		"Double, double toil and trouble;\n"+
		"Fire burn and cauldron bubble.\n"+
		"Second Witch\n"+
		"Cool it with a baboon's blood,\n"+
		"Then the charm is firm and good.\n"+
		"Enter HECATE to the other three Witches\n"+
		"HECATE\n"+
		"O well done! I commend your pains;\n"+
		"And every one shall share i' the gains;\n"+
		"And now about the cauldron sing,\n"+
		"Live elves and fairies in a ring,\n"+
		"Enchanting all that you put in.\n"+
		"Music and a song: 'Black spirits,' & c\n"+
		"HECATE retires\n"+
		"Second Witch\n"+
		"By the pricking of my thumbs,\n"+
		"Something wicked this way comes.\n"+
		"Open, locks,\n"+
		"Whoever knocks!\n"+
		"Enter MACBETH\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags!\n"+
		"What is't you do?\n"+
		"ALL\n"+
		"A deed without a name.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"I conjure you, by that which you profess,\n"+
		"Howe'er you come to know it, answer me:\n"+
		"Though you untie the winds and let them fight\n"+
		"Against the churches; though the yesty waves\n"+
		"Confound and swallow navigation up;\n"+
		"Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down;\n"+
		"Though castles topple on their warders' heads;\n"+
		"Though palaces and pyramids do slope\n"+
		"Their heads to their foundations; though the treasure\n"+
		"Of nature's germens tumble all together,\n"+
		"Even till destruction sicken; answer me\n"+
		"To what I ask you.\n"+
		"First Witch\n"+
		"Speak.\n"+
		"Second Witch\n"+
		"Demand.\n"+
		"Third Witch\n"+
		"We'll answer.\n"+
		"First Witch\n"+
		"Say, if thou'dst rather hear it from our mouths,\n"+
		"Or from our masters?\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Call 'em; let me see 'em.\n"+
		"First Witch\n"+
		"Pour in sow's blood, that hath eaten\n"+
		"Her nine farrow; grease that's sweaten\n"+
		"From the murderer's gibbet throw\n"+
		"Into the flame.\n"+
		"ALL\n"+
		"Come, high or low;\n"+
		"Thyself and office deftly show!\n"+
		"Thunder. First Apparition: an armed Head\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Tell me, thou unknown power,--\n"+
		"First Witch\n"+
		"He knows thy thought:\n"+
		"Hear his speech, but say thou nought.\n"+
		"First Apparition\n"+
		"Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! beware Macduff;\n"+
		"Beware the thane of Fife. Dismiss me. Enough.\n"+
		"Descends\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Whate'er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks;\n"+
		"Thou hast harp'd my fear aright: but one\n"+
		"word more,--\n"+
		"First Witch\n"+
		"He will not be commanded: here's another,\n"+
		"More potent than the first.\n"+
		"Thunder. Second Apparition: A bloody Child\n"+
		"Second Apparition\n"+
		"Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth!\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Had I three ears, I'ld hear thee.\n"+
		"Second Apparition\n"+
		"Be bloody, bold, and resolute; laugh to scorn\n"+
		"The power of man, for none of woman born\n"+
		"Shall harm Macbeth.\n"+
		"Descends\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Then live, Macduff: what need I fear of thee?\n"+
		"But yet I'll make assurance double sure,\n"+
		"And take a bond of fate: thou shalt not live;\n"+
		"That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies,\n"+
		"And sleep in spite of thunder.\n"+
		"Thunder. Third Apparition: a Child crowned, with a tree in his hand\n"+
		"What is this\n"+
		"That rises like the issue of a king,\n"+
		"And wears upon his baby-brow the round\n"+
		"And top of sovereignty?\n"+
		"ALL\n"+
		"Listen, but speak not to't.\n"+
		"Third Apparition\n"+
		"Be lion-mettled, proud; and take no care\n"+
		"Who chafes, who frets, or where conspirers are:\n"+
		"Macbeth shall never vanquish'd be until\n"+
		"Great Birnam wood to high Dunsinane hill\n"+
		"Shall come against him.\n"+
		"Descends\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"That will never be\n"+
		"Who can impress the forest, bid the tree\n"+
		"Unfix his earth-bound root? Sweet bodements! good!\n"+
		"Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood\n"+
		"Of Birnam rise, and our high-placed Macbeth\n"+
		"Shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath\n"+
		"To time and mortal custom. Yet my heart\n"+
		"Throbs to know one thing: tell me, if your art\n"+
		"Can tell so much: shall Banquo's issue ever\n"+
		"Reign in this kingdom?\n"+
		"ALL\n"+
		"Seek to know no more.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"I will be satisfied: deny me this,\n"+
		"And an eternal curse fall on you! Let me know.\n"+
		"Why sinks that cauldron? and what noise is this?\n"+
		"Hautboys\n"+
		"First Witch\n"+
		"Show!\n"+
		"Second Witch\n"+
		"Show!\n"+
		"Third Witch\n"+
		"Show!\n"+
		"ALL\n"+
		"Show his eyes, and grieve his heart;\n"+
		"Come like shadows, so depart!\n"+
		"A show of Eight Kings, the last with a glass in his hand; GHOST OF BANQUO following\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo: down!\n"+
		"Thy crown does sear mine eye-balls. And thy hair,\n"+
		"Thou other gold-bound brow, is like the first.\n"+
		"A third is like the former. Filthy hags!\n"+
		"Why do you show me this? A fourth! Start, eyes!\n"+
		"What, will the line stretch out to the crack of doom?\n"+
		"Another yet! A seventh! I'll see no more:\n"+
		"And yet the eighth appears, who bears a glass\n"+
		"Which shows me many more; and some I see\n"+
		"That two-fold balls and treble scepters carry:\n"+
		"Horrible sight! Now, I see, 'tis true;\n"+
		"For the blood-bolter'd Banquo smiles upon me,\n"+
		"And points at them for his.\n"+
		"Apparitions vanish\n"+
		"What, is this so?\n"+
		"First Witch\n"+
		"Ay, sir, all this is so: but why\n"+
		"Stands Macbeth thus amazedly?\n"+
		"Come, sisters, cheer we up his sprites,\n"+
		"And show the best of our delights:\n"+
		"I'll charm the air to give a sound,\n"+
		"While you perform your antic round:\n"+
		"That this great king may kindly say,\n"+
		"Our duties did his welcome pay.\n"+
		"Music. The witches dance and then vanish, with HECATE\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Where are they? Gone? Let this pernicious hour\n"+
		"Stand aye accursed in the calendar!\n"+
		"Come in, without there!\n"+
		"Enter LENNOX\n"+
		"LENNOX\n"+
		"What's your grace's will?\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Saw you the weird sisters?\n"+
		"LENNOX\n"+
		"No, my lord.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Came they not by you?\n"+
		"LENNOX\n"+
		"No, indeed, my lord.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Infected be the air whereon they ride;\n"+
		"And damn'd all those that trust them! I did hear\n"+
		"The galloping of horse: who was't came by?\n"+
		"LENNOX\n"+
		"'Tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word\n"+
		"Macduff is fled to England.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Fled to England!\n"+
		"LENNOX\n"+
		"Ay, my good lord.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Time, thou anticipatest my dread exploits:\n"+
		"The flighty purpose never is o'ertook\n"+
		"Unless the deed go with it; from this moment\n"+
		"The very firstlings of my heart shall be\n"+
		"The firstlings of my hand. And even now,\n"+
		"To crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and done:\n"+
		"The castle of Macduff I will surprise;\n"+
		"Seize upon Fife; give to the edge o' the sword\n"+
		"His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls\n"+
		"That trace him in his line. No boasting like a fool;\n"+
		"This deed I'll do before this purpose cool.\n"+
		"But no more sights!--Where are these gentlemen?\n"+
		"Come, bring me where they are.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. Fife. Macduff's castle.\n"+
		"Enter LADY MACDUFF, her Son, and ROSS\n"+
		"LADY MACDUFF\n"+
		"What had he done, to make him fly the land?\n"+
		"ROSS\n"+
		"You must have patience, madam.\n"+
		"LADY MACDUFF\n"+
		"He had none:\n"+
		"His flight was madness: when our actions do not,\n"+
		"Our fears do make us traitors.\n"+
		"ROSS\n"+
		"You know not\n"+
		"Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.\n"+
		"LADY MACDUFF\n"+
		"Wisdom! to leave his wife, to leave his babes,\n"+
		"His mansion and his titles in a place\n"+
		"From whence himself does fly? He loves us not;\n"+
		"He wants the natural touch: for the poor wren,\n"+
		"The most diminutive of birds, will fight,\n"+
		"Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.\n"+
		"All is the fear and nothing is the love;\n"+
		"As little is the wisdom, where the flight\n"+
		"So runs against all reason.\n"+
		"ROSS\n"+
		"My dearest coz,\n"+
		"I pray you, school yourself: but for your husband,\n"+
		"He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows\n"+
		"The fits o' the season. I dare not speak\n"+
		"much further;\n"+
		"But cruel are the times, when we are traitors\n"+
		"And do not know ourselves, when we hold rumour\n"+
		"From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,\n"+
		"But float upon a wild and violent sea\n"+
		"Each way and move. I take my leave of you:\n"+
		"Shall not be long but I'll be here again:\n"+
		"Things at the worst will cease, or else climb upward\n"+
		"To what they were before. My pretty cousin,\n"+
		"Blessing upon you!\n"+
		"LADY MACDUFF\n"+
		"Father'd he is, and yet he's fatherless.\n"+
		"ROSS\n"+
		"I am so much a fool, should I stay longer,\n"+
		"It would be my disgrace and your discomfort:\n"+
		"I take my leave at once.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"LADY MACDUFF\n"+
		"Sirrah, your father's dead;\n"+
		"And what will you do now? How will you live?\n"+
		"Son\n"+
		"As birds do, mother.\n"+
		"LADY MACDUFF\n"+
		"What, with worms and flies?\n"+
		"Son\n"+
		"With what I get, I mean; and so do they.\n"+
		"LADY MACDUFF\n"+
		"Poor bird! thou'ldst never fear the net nor lime,\n"+
		"The pitfall nor the gin.\n"+
		"Son\n"+
		"Why should I, mother? Poor birds they are not set for.\n"+
		"My father is not dead, for all your saying.\n"+
		"LADY MACDUFF\n"+
		"Yes, he is dead; how wilt thou do for a father?\n"+
		"Son\n"+
		"Nay, how will you do for a husband?\n"+
		"LADY MACDUFF\n"+
		"Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.\n"+
		"Son\n"+
		"Then you'll buy 'em to sell again.\n"+
		"LADY MACDUFF\n"+
		"Thou speak'st with all thy wit: and yet, i' faith,\n"+
		"With wit enough for thee.\n"+
		"Son\n"+
		"Was my father a traitor, mother?\n"+
		"LADY MACDUFF\n"+
		"Ay, that he was.\n"+
		"Son\n"+
		"What is a traitor?\n"+
		"LADY MACDUFF\n"+
		"Why, one that swears and lies.\n"+
		"Son\n"+
		"And be all traitors that do so?\n"+
		"LADY MACDUFF\n"+
		"Every one that does so is a traitor, and must be hanged.\n"+
		"Son\n"+
		"And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?\n"+
		"LADY MACDUFF\n"+
		"Every one.\n"+
		"Son\n"+
		"Who must hang them?\n"+
		"LADY MACDUFF\n"+
		"Why, the honest men.\n"+
		"Son\n"+
		"Then the liars and swearers are fools,\n"+
		"for there are liars and swearers enow to beat\n"+
		"the honest men and hang up them.\n"+
		"LADY MACDUFF\n"+
		"Now, God help thee, poor monkey!\n"+
		"But how wilt thou do for a father?\n"+
		"Son\n"+
		"If he were dead, you'ld weep for\n"+
		"him: if you would not, it were a good sign\n"+
		"that I should quickly have a new father.\n"+
		"LADY MACDUFF\n"+
		"Poor prattler, how thou talk'st!\n"+
		"Enter a Messenger\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Bless you, fair dame! I am not to you known,\n"+
		"Though in your state of honour I am perfect.\n"+
		"I doubt some danger does approach you nearly:\n"+
		"If you will take a homely man's advice,\n"+
		"Be not found here; hence, with your little ones.\n"+
		"To fright you thus, methinks, I am too savage;\n"+
		"To do worse to you were fell cruelty,\n"+
		"Which is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve you!\n"+
		"I dare abide no longer.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"LADY MACDUFF\n"+
		"Whither should I fly?\n"+
		"I have done no harm. But I remember now\n"+
		"I am in this earthly world; where to do harm\n"+
		"Is often laudable, to do good sometime\n"+
		"Accounted dangerous folly: why then, alas,\n"+
		"Do I put up that womanly defence,\n"+
		"To say I have done no harm?\n"+
		"Enter Murderers\n"+
		"What are these faces?\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"Where is your husband?\n"+
		"LADY MACDUFF\n"+
		"I hope, in no place so unsanctified\n"+
		"Where such as thou mayst find him.\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"He's a traitor.\n"+
		"Son\n"+
		"Thou liest, thou shag-hair'd villain!\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"What, you egg!\n"+
		"Stabbing him\n"+
		"Young fry of treachery!\n"+
		"Son\n"+
		"He has kill'd me, mother:\n"+
		"Run away, I pray you!\n"+
		"Dies\n"+
		"Exit LADY MACDUFF, crying 'Murder!' Exeunt Murderers, following her\n"+
		"SCENE III. England. Before the King's palace.\n"+
		"Enter MALCOLM and MACDUFF\n"+
		"MALCOLM\n"+
		"Let us seek out some desolate shade, and there\n"+
		"Weep our sad bosoms empty.\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"Let us rather\n"+
		"Hold fast the mortal sword, and like good men\n"+
		"Bestride our down-fall'n birthdom: each new morn\n"+
		"New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows\n"+
		"Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds\n"+
		"As if it felt with Scotland and yell'd out\n"+
		"Like syllable of dolour.\n"+
		"MALCOLM\n"+
		"What I believe I'll wail,\n"+
		"What know believe, and what I can redress,\n"+
		"As I shall find the time to friend, I will.\n"+
		"What you have spoke, it may be so perchance.\n"+
		"This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,\n"+
		"Was once thought honest: you have loved him well.\n"+
		"He hath not touch'd you yet. I am young;\n"+
		"but something\n"+
		"You may deserve of him through me, and wisdom\n"+
		"To offer up a weak poor innocent lamb\n"+
		"To appease an angry god.\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"I am not treacherous.\n"+
		"MALCOLM\n"+
		"But Macbeth is.\n"+
		"A good and virtuous nature may recoil\n"+
		"In an imperial charge. But I shall crave\n"+
		"your pardon;\n"+
		"That which you are my thoughts cannot transpose:\n"+
		"Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell;\n"+
		"Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace,\n"+
		"Yet grace must still look so.\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"I have lost my hopes.\n"+
		"MALCOLM\n"+
		"Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.\n"+
		"Why in that rawness left you wife and child,\n"+
		"Those precious motives, those strong knots of love,\n"+
		"Without leave-taking? I pray you,\n"+
		"Let not my jealousies be your dishonours,\n"+
		"But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,\n"+
		"Whatever I shall think.\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"Bleed, bleed, poor country!\n"+
		"Great tyranny! lay thou thy basis sure,\n"+
		"For goodness dare not cheque thee: wear thou\n"+
		"thy wrongs;\n"+
		"The title is affeer'd! Fare thee well, lord:\n"+
		"I would not be the villain that thou think'st\n"+
		"For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp,\n"+
		"And the rich East to boot.\n"+
		"MALCOLM\n"+
		"Be not offended:\n"+
		"I speak not as in absolute fear of you.\n"+
		"I think our country sinks beneath the yoke;\n"+
		"It weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash\n"+
		"Is added to her wounds: I think withal\n"+
		"There would be hands uplifted in my right;\n"+
		"And here from gracious England have I offer\n"+
		"Of goodly thousands: but, for all this,\n"+
		"When I shall tread upon the tyrant's head,\n"+
		"Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country\n"+
		"Shall have more vices than it had before,\n"+
		"More suffer and more sundry ways than ever,\n"+
		"By him that shall succeed.\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"What should he be?\n"+
		"MALCOLM\n"+
		"It is myself I mean: in whom I know\n"+
		"All the particulars of vice so grafted\n"+
		"That, when they shall be open'd, black Macbeth\n"+
		"Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state\n"+
		"Esteem him as a lamb, being compared\n"+
		"With my confineless harms.\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"Not in the legions\n"+
		"Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn'd\n"+
		"In evils to top Macbeth.\n"+
		"MALCOLM\n"+
		"I grant him bloody,\n"+
		"Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,\n"+
		"Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin\n"+
		"That has a name: but there's no bottom, none,\n"+
		"In my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,\n"+
		"Your matrons and your maids, could not fill up\n"+
		"The cistern of my lust, and my desire\n"+
		"All continent impediments would o'erbear\n"+
		"That did oppose my will: better Macbeth\n"+
		"Than such an one to reign.\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"Boundless intemperance\n"+
		"In nature is a tyranny; it hath been\n"+
		"The untimely emptying of the happy throne\n"+
		"And fall of many kings. But fear not yet\n"+
		"To take upon you what is yours: you may\n"+
		"Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,\n"+
		"And yet seem cold, the time you may so hoodwink.\n"+
		"We have willing dames enough: there cannot be\n"+
		"That vulture in you, to devour so many\n"+
		"As will to greatness dedicate themselves,\n"+
		"Finding it so inclined.\n"+
		"MALCOLM\n"+
		"With this there grows\n"+
		"In my most ill-composed affection such\n"+
		"A stanchless avarice that, were I king,\n"+
		"I should cut off the nobles for their lands,\n"+
		"Desire his jewels and this other's house:\n"+
		"And my more-having would be as a sauce\n"+
		"To make me hunger more; that I should forge\n"+
		"Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,\n"+
		"Destroying them for wealth.\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"This avarice\n"+
		"Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root\n"+
		"Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been\n"+
		"The sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear;\n"+
		"Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will.\n"+
		"Of your mere own: all these are portable,\n"+
		"With other graces weigh'd.\n"+
		"MALCOLM\n"+
		"But I have none: the king-becoming graces,\n"+
		"As justice, verity, temperance, stableness,\n"+
		"Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,\n"+
		"Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,\n"+
		"I have no relish of them, but abound\n"+
		"In the division of each several crime,\n"+
		"Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should\n"+
		"Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,\n"+
		"Uproar the universal peace, confound\n"+
		"All unity on earth.\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"O Scotland, Scotland!\n"+
		"MALCOLM\n"+
		"If such a one be fit to govern, speak:\n"+
		"I am as I have spoken.\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"Fit to govern!\n"+
		"No, not to live. O nation miserable,\n"+
		"With an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter'd,\n"+
		"When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,\n"+
		"Since that the truest issue of thy throne\n"+
		"By his own interdiction stands accursed,\n"+
		"And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father\n"+
		"Was a most sainted king: the queen that bore thee,\n"+
		"Oftener upon her knees than on her feet,\n"+
		"Died every day she lived. Fare thee well!\n"+
		"These evils thou repeat'st upon thyself\n"+
		"Have banish'd me from Scotland. O my breast,\n"+
		"Thy hope ends here!\n"+
		"MALCOLM\n"+
		"Macduff, this noble passion,\n"+
		"Child of integrity, hath from my soul\n"+
		"Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts\n"+
		"To thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth\n"+
		"By many of these trains hath sought to win me\n"+
		"Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me\n"+
		"From over-credulous haste: but God above\n"+
		"Deal between thee and me! for even now\n"+
		"I put myself to thy direction, and\n"+
		"Unspeak mine own detraction, here abjure\n"+
		"The taints and blames I laid upon myself,\n"+
		"For strangers to my nature. I am yet\n"+
		"Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,\n"+
		"Scarcely have coveted what was mine own,\n"+
		"At no time broke my faith, would not betray\n"+
		"The devil to his fellow and delight\n"+
		"No less in truth than life: my first false speaking\n"+
		"Was this upon myself: what I am truly,\n"+
		"Is thine and my poor country's to command:\n"+
		"Whither indeed, before thy here-approach,\n"+
		"Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men,\n"+
		"Already at a point, was setting forth.\n"+
		"Now we'll together; and the chance of goodness\n"+
		"Be like our warranted quarrel! Why are you silent?\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"Such welcome and unwelcome things at once\n"+
		"'Tis hard to reconcile.\n"+
		"Enter a Doctor\n"+
		"MALCOLM\n"+
		"Well; more anon.--Comes the king forth, I pray you?\n"+
		"Doctor\n"+
		"Ay, sir; there are a crew of wretched souls\n"+
		"That stay his cure: their malady convinces\n"+
		"The great assay of art; but at his touch--\n"+
		"Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand--\n"+
		"They presently amend.\n"+
		"MALCOLM\n"+
		"I thank you, doctor.\n"+
		"Exit Doctor\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"What's the disease he means?\n"+
		"MALCOLM\n"+
		"'Tis call'd the evil:\n"+
		"A most miraculous work in this good king;\n"+
		"Which often, since my here-remain in England,\n"+
		"I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,\n"+
		"Himself best knows: but strangely-visited people,\n"+
		"All swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,\n"+
		"The mere despair of surgery, he cures,\n"+
		"Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,\n"+
		"Put on with holy prayers: and 'tis spoken,\n"+
		"To the succeeding royalty he leaves\n"+
		"The healing benediction. With this strange virtue,\n"+
		"He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy,\n"+
		"And sundry blessings hang about his throne,\n"+
		"That speak him full of grace.\n"+
		"Enter ROSS\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"See, who comes here?\n"+
		"MALCOLM\n"+
		"My countryman; but yet I know him not.\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"My ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither.\n"+
		"MALCOLM\n"+
		"I know him now. Good God, betimes remove\n"+
		"The means that makes us strangers!\n"+
		"ROSS\n"+
		"Sir, amen.\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"Stands Scotland where it did?\n"+
		"ROSS\n"+
		"Alas, poor country!\n"+
		"Almost afraid to know itself. It cannot\n"+
		"Be call'd our mother, but our grave; where nothing,\n"+
		"But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;\n"+
		"Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air\n"+
		"Are made, not mark'd; where violent sorrow seems\n"+
		"A modern ecstasy; the dead man's knell\n"+
		"Is there scarce ask'd for who; and good men's lives\n"+
		"Expire before the flowers in their caps,\n"+
		"Dying or ere they sicken.\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"O, relation\n"+
		"Too nice, and yet too true!\n"+
		"MALCOLM\n"+
		"What's the newest grief?\n"+
		"ROSS\n"+
		"That of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker:\n"+
		"Each minute teems a new one.\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"How does my wife?\n"+
		"ROSS\n"+
		"Why, well.\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"And all my children?\n"+
		"ROSS\n"+
		"Well too.\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"The tyrant has not batter'd at their peace?\n"+
		"ROSS\n"+
		"No; they were well at peace when I did leave 'em.\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"But not a niggard of your speech: how goes't?\n"+
		"ROSS\n"+
		"When I came hither to transport the tidings,\n"+
		"Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour\n"+
		"Of many worthy fellows that were out;\n"+
		"Which was to my belief witness'd the rather,\n"+
		"For that I saw the tyrant's power a-foot:\n"+
		"Now is the time of help; your eye in Scotland\n"+
		"Would create soldiers, make our women fight,\n"+
		"To doff their dire distresses.\n"+
		"MALCOLM\n"+
		"Be't their comfort\n"+
		"We are coming thither: gracious England hath\n"+
		"Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men;\n"+
		"An older and a better soldier none\n"+
		"That Christendom gives out.\n"+
		"ROSS\n"+
		"Would I could answer\n"+
		"This comfort with the like! But I have words\n"+
		"That would be howl'd out in the desert air,\n"+
		"Where hearing should not latch them.\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"What concern they?\n"+
		"The general cause? or is it a fee-grief\n"+
		"Due to some single breast?\n"+
		"ROSS\n"+
		"No mind that's honest\n"+
		"But in it shares some woe; though the main part\n"+
		"Pertains to you alone.\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"If it be mine,\n"+
		"Keep it not from me, quickly let me have it.\n"+
		"ROSS\n"+
		"Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever,\n"+
		"Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound\n"+
		"That ever yet they heard.\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"Hum! I guess at it.\n"+
		"ROSS\n"+
		"Your castle is surprised; your wife and babes\n"+
		"Savagely slaughter'd: to relate the manner,\n"+
		"Were, on the quarry of these murder'd deer,\n"+
		"To add the death of you.\n"+
		"MALCOLM\n"+
		"Merciful heaven!\n"+
		"What, man! ne'er pull your hat upon your brows;\n"+
		"Give sorrow words: the grief that does not speak\n"+
		"Whispers the o'er-fraught heart and bids it break.\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"My children too?\n"+
		"ROSS\n"+
		"Wife, children, servants, all\n"+
		"That could be found.\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"And I must be from thence!\n"+
		"My wife kill'd too?\n"+
		"ROSS\n"+
		"I have said.\n"+
		"MALCOLM\n"+
		"Be comforted:\n"+
		"Let's make us medicines of our great revenge,\n"+
		"To cure this deadly grief.\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"He has no children. All my pretty ones?\n"+
		"Did you say all? O hell-kite! All?\n"+
		"What, all my pretty chickens and their dam\n"+
		"At one fell swoop?\n"+
		"MALCOLM\n"+
		"Dispute it like a man.\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"I shall do so;\n"+
		"But I must also feel it as a man:\n"+
		"I cannot but remember such things were,\n"+
		"That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on,\n"+
		"And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,\n"+
		"They were all struck for thee! naught that I am,\n"+
		"Not for their own demerits, but for mine,\n"+
		"Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now!\n"+
		"MALCOLM\n"+
		"Be this the whetstone of your sword: let grief\n"+
		"Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it.\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"O, I could play the woman with mine eyes\n"+
		"And braggart with my tongue! But, gentle heavens,\n"+
		"Cut short all intermission; front to front\n"+
		"Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;\n"+
		"Within my sword's length set him; if he 'scape,\n"+
		"Heaven forgive him too!\n"+
		"MALCOLM\n"+
		"This tune goes manly.\n"+
		"Come, go we to the king; our power is ready;\n"+
		"Our lack is nothing but our leave; Macbeth\n"+
		"Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above\n"+
		"Put on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may:\n"+
		"The night is long that never finds the day.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT V\n"+
		"SCENE I. Dunsinane. Ante-room in the castle.\n"+
		"Enter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting-Gentlewoman\n"+
		"Doctor\n"+
		"I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive\n"+
		"no truth in your report. When was it she last walked?\n"+
		"Gentlewoman\n"+
		"Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen\n"+
		"her rise from her bed, throw her night-gown upon\n"+
		"her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it,\n"+
		"write upon't, read it, afterwards seal it, and again\n"+
		"return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.\n"+
		"Doctor\n"+
		"A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once\n"+
		"the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of\n"+
		"watching! In this slumbery agitation, besides her\n"+
		"walking and other actual performances, what, at any\n"+
		"time, have you heard her say?\n"+
		"Gentlewoman\n"+
		"That, sir, which I will not report after her.\n"+
		"Doctor\n"+
		"You may to me: and 'tis most meet you should.\n"+
		"Gentlewoman\n"+
		"Neither to you nor any one; having no witness to\n"+
		"confirm my speech.\n"+
		"Enter LADY MACBETH, with a taper\n"+
		"Lo you, here she comes! This is her very guise;\n"+
		"and, upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close.\n"+
		"Doctor\n"+
		"How came she by that light?\n"+
		"Gentlewoman\n"+
		"Why, it stood by her: she has light by her\n"+
		"continually; 'tis her command.\n"+
		"Doctor\n"+
		"You see, her eyes are open.\n"+
		"Gentlewoman\n"+
		"Ay, but their sense is shut.\n"+
		"Doctor\n"+
		"What is it she does now? Look, how she rubs her hands.\n"+
		"Gentlewoman\n"+
		"It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus\n"+
		"washing her hands: I have known her continue in\n"+
		"this a quarter of an hour.\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"Yet here's a spot.\n"+
		"Doctor\n"+
		"Hark! she speaks: I will set down what comes from\n"+
		"her, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"Out, damned spot! out, I say!--One: two: why,\n"+
		"then, 'tis time to do't.--Hell is murky!--Fie, my\n"+
		"lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need we\n"+
		"fear who knows it, when none can call our power to\n"+
		"account?--Yet who would have thought the old man\n"+
		"to have had so much blood in him.\n"+
		"Doctor\n"+
		"Do you mark that?\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"The thane of Fife had a wife: where is she now?--\n"+
		"What, will these hands ne'er be clean?--No more o'\n"+
		"that, my lord, no more o' that: you mar all with\n"+
		"this starting.\n"+
		"Doctor\n"+
		"Go to, go to; you have known what you should not.\n"+
		"Gentlewoman\n"+
		"She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of\n"+
		"that: heaven knows what she has known.\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"Here's the smell of the blood still: all the\n"+
		"perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little\n"+
		"hand. Oh, oh, oh!\n"+
		"Doctor\n"+
		"What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.\n"+
		"Gentlewoman\n"+
		"I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the\n"+
		"dignity of the whole body.\n"+
		"Doctor\n"+
		"Well, well, well,--\n"+
		"Gentlewoman\n"+
		"Pray God it be, sir.\n"+
		"Doctor\n"+
		"This disease is beyond my practise: yet I have known\n"+
		"those which have walked in their sleep who have died\n"+
		"holily in their beds.\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"Wash your hands, put on your nightgown; look not so\n"+
		"pale.--I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried; he\n"+
		"cannot come out on's grave.\n"+
		"Doctor\n"+
		"Even so?\n"+
		"LADY MACBETH\n"+
		"To bed, to bed! there's knocking at the gate:\n"+
		"come, come, come, come, give me your hand. What's\n"+
		"done cannot be undone.--To bed, to bed, to bed!\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"Doctor\n"+
		"Will she go now to bed?\n"+
		"Gentlewoman\n"+
		"Directly.\n"+
		"Doctor\n"+
		"Foul whisperings are abroad: unnatural deeds\n"+
		"Do breed unnatural troubles: infected minds\n"+
		"To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets:\n"+
		"More needs she the divine than the physician.\n"+
		"God, God forgive us all! Look after her;\n"+
		"Remove from her the means of all annoyance,\n"+
		"And still keep eyes upon her. So, good night:\n"+
		"My mind she has mated, and amazed my sight.\n"+
		"I think, but dare not speak.\n"+
		"Gentlewoman\n"+
		"Good night, good doctor.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. The country near Dunsinane.\n"+
		"Drum and colours. Enter MENTEITH, CAITHNESS, ANGUS, LENNOX, and Soldiers\n"+
		"MENTEITH\n"+
		"The English power is near, led on by Malcolm,\n"+
		"His uncle Siward and the good Macduff:\n"+
		"Revenges burn in them; for their dear causes\n"+
		"Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm\n"+
		"Excite the mortified man.\n"+
		"ANGUS\n"+
		"Near Birnam wood\n"+
		"Shall we well meet them; that way are they coming.\n"+
		"CAITHNESS\n"+
		"Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?\n"+
		"LENNOX\n"+
		"For certain, sir, he is not: I have a file\n"+
		"Of all the gentry: there is Siward's son,\n"+
		"And many unrough youths that even now\n"+
		"Protest their first of manhood.\n"+
		"MENTEITH\n"+
		"What does the tyrant?\n"+
		"CAITHNESS\n"+
		"Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies:\n"+
		"Some say he's mad; others that lesser hate him\n"+
		"Do call it valiant fury: but, for certain,\n"+
		"He cannot buckle his distemper'd cause\n"+
		"Within the belt of rule.\n"+
		"ANGUS\n"+
		"Now does he feel\n"+
		"His secret murders sticking on his hands;\n"+
		"Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach;\n"+
		"Those he commands move only in command,\n"+
		"Nothing in love: now does he feel his title\n"+
		"Hang loose about him, like a giant's robe\n"+
		"Upon a dwarfish thief.\n"+
		"MENTEITH\n"+
		"Who then shall blame\n"+
		"His pester'd senses to recoil and start,\n"+
		"When all that is within him does condemn\n"+
		"Itself for being there?\n"+
		"CAITHNESS\n"+
		"Well, march we on,\n"+
		"To give obedience where 'tis truly owed:\n"+
		"Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal,\n"+
		"And with him pour we in our country's purge\n"+
		"Each drop of us.\n"+
		"LENNOX\n"+
		"Or so much as it needs,\n"+
		"To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds.\n"+
		"Make we our march towards Birnam.\n"+
		"Exeunt, marching\n"+
		"SCENE III. Dunsinane. A room in the castle.\n"+
		"Enter MACBETH, Doctor, and Attendants\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Bring me no more reports; let them fly all:\n"+
		"Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane,\n"+
		"I cannot taint with fear. What's the boy Malcolm?\n"+
		"Was he not born of woman? The spirits that know\n"+
		"All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus:\n"+
		"'Fear not, Macbeth; no man that's born of woman\n"+
		"Shall e'er have power upon thee.' Then fly,\n"+
		"false thanes,\n"+
		"And mingle with the English epicures:\n"+
		"The mind I sway by and the heart I bear\n"+
		"Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.\n"+
		"Enter a Servant\n"+
		"The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon!\n"+
		"Where got'st thou that goose look?\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"There is ten thousand--\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Geese, villain!\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"Soldiers, sir.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Go prick thy face, and over-red thy fear,\n"+
		"Thou lily-liver'd boy. What soldiers, patch?\n"+
		"Death of thy soul! those linen cheeks of thine\n"+
		"Are counsellors to fear. What soldiers, whey-face?\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"The English force, so please you.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Take thy face hence.\n"+
		"Exit Servant\n"+
		"Seyton!--I am sick at heart,\n"+
		"When I behold--Seyton, I say!--This push\n"+
		"Will cheer me ever, or disseat me now.\n"+
		"I have lived long enough: my way of life\n"+
		"Is fall'n into the sear, the yellow leaf;\n"+
		"And that which should accompany old age,\n"+
		"As honour, love, obedience, troops of friends,\n"+
		"I must not look to have; but, in their stead,\n"+
		"Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honour, breath,\n"+
		"Which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not. Seyton!\n"+
		"Enter SEYTON\n"+
		"SEYTON\n"+
		"What is your gracious pleasure?\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"What news more?\n"+
		"SEYTON\n"+
		"All is confirm'd, my lord, which was reported.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"I'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hack'd.\n"+
		"Give me my armour.\n"+
		"SEYTON\n"+
		"'Tis not needed yet.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"I'll put it on.\n"+
		"Send out more horses; skirr the country round;\n"+
		"Hang those that talk of fear. Give me mine armour.\n"+
		"How does your patient, doctor?\n"+
		"Doctor\n"+
		"Not so sick, my lord,\n"+
		"As she is troubled with thick coming fancies,\n"+
		"That keep her from her rest.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Cure her of that.\n"+
		"Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased,\n"+
		"Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,\n"+
		"Raze out the written troubles of the brain\n"+
		"And with some sweet oblivious antidote\n"+
		"Cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff\n"+
		"Which weighs upon the heart?\n"+
		"Doctor\n"+
		"Therein the patient\n"+
		"Must minister to himself.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Throw physic to the dogs; I'll none of it.\n"+
		"Come, put mine armour on; give me my staff.\n"+
		"Seyton, send out. Doctor, the thanes fly from me.\n"+
		"Come, sir, dispatch. If thou couldst, doctor, cast\n"+
		"The water of my land, find her disease,\n"+
		"And purge it to a sound and pristine health,\n"+
		"I would applaud thee to the very echo,\n"+
		"That should applaud again.--Pull't off, I say.--\n"+
		"What rhubarb, cyme, or what purgative drug,\n"+
		"Would scour these English hence? Hear'st thou of them?\n"+
		"Doctor\n"+
		"Ay, my good lord; your royal preparation\n"+
		"Makes us hear something.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Bring it after me.\n"+
		"I will not be afraid of death and bane,\n"+
		"Till Birnam forest come to Dunsinane.\n"+
		"Doctor\n"+
		"[Aside] Were I from Dunsinane away and clear,\n"+
		"Profit again should hardly draw me here.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV. Country near Birnam wood.\n"+
		"Drum and colours. Enter MALCOLM, SIWARD and YOUNG SIWARD, MACDUFF, MENTEITH, CAITHNESS, ANGUS, LENNOX, ROSS, and Soldiers, marching\n"+
		"MALCOLM\n"+
		"Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand\n"+
		"That chambers will be safe.\n"+
		"MENTEITH\n"+
		"We doubt it nothing.\n"+
		"SIWARD\n"+
		"What wood is this before us?\n"+
		"MENTEITH\n"+
		"The wood of Birnam.\n"+
		"MALCOLM\n"+
		"Let every soldier hew him down a bough\n"+
		"And bear't before him: thereby shall we shadow\n"+
		"The numbers of our host and make discovery\n"+
		"Err in report of us.\n"+
		"Soldiers\n"+
		"It shall be done.\n"+
		"SIWARD\n"+
		"We learn no other but the confident tyrant\n"+
		"Keeps still in Dunsinane, and will endure\n"+
		"Our setting down before 't.\n"+
		"MALCOLM\n"+
		"'Tis his main hope:\n"+
		"For where there is advantage to be given,\n"+
		"Both more and less have given him the revolt,\n"+
		"And none serve with him but constrained things\n"+
		"Whose hearts are absent too.\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"Let our just censures\n"+
		"Attend the true event, and put we on\n"+
		"Industrious soldiership.\n"+
		"SIWARD\n"+
		"The time approaches\n"+
		"That will with due decision make us know\n"+
		"What we shall say we have and what we owe.\n"+
		"Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate,\n"+
		"But certain issue strokes must arbitrate:\n"+
		"Towards which advance the war.\n"+
		"Exeunt, marching\n"+
		"SCENE V. Dunsinane. Within the castle.\n"+
		"Enter MACBETH, SEYTON, and Soldiers, with drum and colours\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Hang out our banners on the outward walls;\n"+
		"The cry is still 'They come:' our castle's strength\n"+
		"Will laugh a siege to scorn: here let them lie\n"+
		"Till famine and the ague eat them up:\n"+
		"Were they not forced with those that should be ours,\n"+
		"We might have met them dareful, beard to beard,\n"+
		"And beat them backward home.\n"+
		"A cry of women within\n"+
		"What is that noise?\n"+
		"SEYTON\n"+
		"It is the cry of women, my good lord.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"I have almost forgot the taste of fears;\n"+
		"The time has been, my senses would have cool'd\n"+
		"To hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hair\n"+
		"Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir\n"+
		"As life were in't: I have supp'd full with horrors;\n"+
		"Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts\n"+
		"Cannot once start me.\n"+
		"Re-enter SEYTON\n"+
		"Wherefore was that cry?\n"+
		"SEYTON\n"+
		"The queen, my lord, is dead.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"She should have died hereafter;\n"+
		"There would have been a time for such a word.\n"+
		"To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,\n"+
		"Creeps in this petty pace from day to day\n"+
		"To the last syllable of recorded time,\n"+
		"And all our yesterdays have lighted fools\n"+
		"The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!\n"+
		"Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player\n"+
		"That struts and frets his hour upon the stage\n"+
		"And then is heard no more: it is a tale\n"+
		"Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,\n"+
		"Signifying nothing.\n"+
		"Enter a Messenger\n"+
		"Thou comest to use thy tongue; thy story quickly.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Gracious my lord,\n"+
		"I should report that which I say I saw,\n"+
		"But know not how to do it.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Well, say, sir.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"As I did stand my watch upon the hill,\n"+
		"I look'd toward Birnam, and anon, methought,\n"+
		"The wood began to move.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Liar and slave!\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Let me endure your wrath, if't be not so:\n"+
		"Within this three mile may you see it coming;\n"+
		"I say, a moving grove.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"If thou speak'st false,\n"+
		"Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,\n"+
		"Till famine cling thee: if thy speech be sooth,\n"+
		"I care not if thou dost for me as much.\n"+
		"I pull in resolution, and begin\n"+
		"To doubt the equivocation of the fiend\n"+
		"That lies like truth: 'Fear not, till Birnam wood\n"+
		"Do come to Dunsinane:' and now a wood\n"+
		"Comes toward Dunsinane. Arm, arm, and out!\n"+
		"If this which he avouches does appear,\n"+
		"There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.\n"+
		"I gin to be aweary of the sun,\n"+
		"And wish the estate o' the world were now undone.\n"+
		"Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!\n"+
		"At least we'll die with harness on our back.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE VI. Dunsinane. Before the castle.\n"+
		"Drum and colours. Enter MALCOLM, SIWARD, MACDUFF, and their Army, with boughs\n"+
		"MALCOLM\n"+
		"Now near enough: your leafy screens throw down.\n"+
		"And show like those you are. You, worthy uncle,\n"+
		"Shall, with my cousin, your right-noble son,\n"+
		"Lead our first battle: worthy Macduff and we\n"+
		"Shall take upon 's what else remains to do,\n"+
		"According to our order.\n"+
		"SIWARD\n"+
		"Fare you well.\n"+
		"Do we but find the tyrant's power to-night,\n"+
		"Let us be beaten, if we cannot fight.\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"Make all our trumpets speak; give them all breath,\n"+
		"Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE VII. Another part of the field.\n"+
		"Alarums. Enter MACBETH\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"They have tied me to a stake; I cannot fly,\n"+
		"But, bear-like, I must fight the course. What's he\n"+
		"That was not born of woman? Such a one\n"+
		"Am I to fear, or none.\n"+
		"Enter YOUNG SIWARD\n"+
		"YOUNG SIWARD\n"+
		"What is thy name?\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Thou'lt be afraid to hear it.\n"+
		"YOUNG SIWARD\n"+
		"No; though thou call'st thyself a hotter name\n"+
		"Than any is in hell.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"My name's Macbeth.\n"+
		"YOUNG SIWARD\n"+
		"The devil himself could not pronounce a title\n"+
		"More hateful to mine ear.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"No, nor more fearful.\n"+
		"YOUNG SIWARD\n"+
		"Thou liest, abhorred tyrant; with my sword\n"+
		"I'll prove the lie thou speak'st.\n"+
		"They fight and YOUNG SIWARD is slain\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Thou wast born of woman\n"+
		"But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,\n"+
		"Brandish'd by man that's of a woman born.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"Alarums. Enter MACDUFF\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"That way the noise is. Tyrant, show thy face!\n"+
		"If thou be'st slain and with no stroke of mine,\n"+
		"My wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still.\n"+
		"I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms\n"+
		"Are hired to bear their staves: either thou, Macbeth,\n"+
		"Or else my sword with an unbatter'd edge\n"+
		"I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;\n"+
		"By this great clatter, one of greatest note\n"+
		"Seems bruited. Let me find him, fortune!\n"+
		"And more I beg not.\n"+
		"Exit. Alarums\n"+
		"Enter MALCOLM and SIWARD\n"+
		"SIWARD\n"+
		"This way, my lord; the castle's gently render'd:\n"+
		"The tyrant's people on both sides do fight;\n"+
		"The noble thanes do bravely in the war;\n"+
		"The day almost itself professes yours,\n"+
		"And little is to do.\n"+
		"MALCOLM\n"+
		"We have met with foes\n"+
		"That strike beside us.\n"+
		"SIWARD\n"+
		"Enter, sir, the castle.\n"+
		"Exeunt. Alarums\n"+
		"SCENE VIII. Another part of the field.\n"+
		"Enter MACBETH\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Why should I play the Roman fool, and die\n"+
		"On mine own sword? whiles I see lives, the gashes\n"+
		"Do better upon them.\n"+
		"Enter MACDUFF\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"Turn, hell-hound, turn!\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Of all men else I have avoided thee:\n"+
		"But get thee back; my soul is too much charged\n"+
		"With blood of thine already.\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"I have no words:\n"+
		"My voice is in my sword: thou bloodier villain\n"+
		"Than terms can give thee out!\n"+
		"They fight\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Thou losest labour:\n"+
		"As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air\n"+
		"With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed:\n"+
		"Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;\n"+
		"I bear a charmed life, which must not yield,\n"+
		"To one of woman born.\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"Despair thy charm;\n"+
		"And let the angel whom thou still hast served\n"+
		"Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother's womb\n"+
		"Untimely ripp'd.\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,\n"+
		"For it hath cow'd my better part of man!\n"+
		"And be these juggling fiends no more believed,\n"+
		"That palter with us in a double sense;\n"+
		"That keep the word of promise to our ear,\n"+
		"And break it to our hope. I'll not fight with thee.\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"Then yield thee, coward,\n"+
		"And live to be the show and gaze o' the time:\n"+
		"We'll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,\n"+
		"Painted on a pole, and underwrit,\n"+
		"'Here may you see the tyrant.'\n"+
		"MACBETH\n"+
		"I will not yield,\n"+
		"To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet,\n"+
		"And to be baited with the rabble's curse.\n"+
		"Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane,\n"+
		"And thou opposed, being of no woman born,\n"+
		"Yet I will try the last. Before my body\n"+
		"I throw my warlike shield. Lay on, Macduff,\n"+
		"And damn'd be him that first cries, 'Hold, enough!'\n"+
		"Exeunt, fighting. Alarums\n"+
		"Retreat. Flourish. Enter, with drum and colours, MALCOLM, SIWARD, ROSS, the other Thanes, and Soldiers\n"+
		"MALCOLM\n"+
		"I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.\n"+
		"SIWARD\n"+
		"Some must go off: and yet, by these I see,\n"+
		"So great a day as this is cheaply bought.\n"+
		"MALCOLM\n"+
		"Macduff is missing, and your noble son.\n"+
		"ROSS\n"+
		"Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt:\n"+
		"He only lived but till he was a man;\n"+
		"The which no sooner had his prowess confirm'd\n"+
		"In the unshrinking station where he fought,\n"+
		"But like a man he died.\n"+
		"SIWARD\n"+
		"Then he is dead?\n"+
		"ROSS\n"+
		"Ay, and brought off the field: your cause of sorrow\n"+
		"Must not be measured by his worth, for then\n"+
		"It hath no end.\n"+
		"SIWARD\n"+
		"Had he his hurts before?\n"+
		"ROSS\n"+
		"Ay, on the front.\n"+
		"SIWARD\n"+
		"Why then, God's soldier be he!\n"+
		"Had I as many sons as I have hairs,\n"+
		"I would not wish them to a fairer death:\n"+
		"And so, his knell is knoll'd.\n"+
		"MALCOLM\n"+
		"He's worth more sorrow,\n"+
		"And that I'll spend for him.\n"+
		"SIWARD\n"+
		"He's worth no more\n"+
		"They say he parted well, and paid his score:\n"+
		"And so, God be with him! Here comes newer comfort.\n"+
		"Re-enter MACDUFF, with MACBETH's head\n"+
		"MACDUFF\n"+
		"Hail, king! for so thou art: behold, where stands\n"+
		"The usurper's cursed head: the time is free:\n"+
		"I see thee compass'd with thy kingdom's pearl,\n"+
		"That speak my salutation in their minds;\n"+
		"Whose voices I desire aloud with mine:\n"+
		"Hail, King of Scotland!\n"+
		"ALL\n"+
		"Hail, King of Scotland!\n"+
		"Flourish\n"+
		"MALCOLM\n"+
		"We shall not spend a large expense of time\n"+
		"Before we reckon with your several loves,\n"+
		"And make us even with you. My thanes and kinsmen,\n"+
		"Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland\n"+
		"In such an honour named. What's more to do,\n"+
		"Which would be planted newly with the time,\n"+
		"As calling home our exiled friends abroad\n"+
		"That fled the snares of watchful tyranny;\n"+
		"Producing forth the cruel ministers\n"+
		"Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen,\n"+
		"Who, as 'tis thought, by self and violent hands\n"+
		"Took off her life; this, and what needful else\n"+
		"That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace,\n"+
		"We will perform in measure, time and place:\n"+
		"So, thanks to all at once and to each one,\n"+
		"Whom we invite to see us crown'd at Scone.\n"+
		"Flourish. Exeunt\n"
