		"Troilus and Cressida\n"+
		"ACT I\n"+
		"PROLOGUE\n"+
		"In Troy, there lies the scene. From isles of Greece\n"+
		"The princes orgulous, their high blood chafed,\n"+
		"Have to the port of Athens sent their ships,\n"+
		"Fraught with the ministers and instruments\n"+
		"Of cruel war: sixty and nine, that wore\n"+
		"Their crownets regal, from the Athenian bay\n"+
		"Put forth toward Phrygia; and their vow is made\n"+
		"To ransack Troy, within whose strong immures\n"+
		"The ravish'd Helen, Menelaus' queen,\n"+
		"With wanton Paris sleeps; and that's the quarrel.\n"+
		"To Tenedos they come;\n"+
		"And the deep-drawing barks do there disgorge\n"+
		"Their warlike fraughtage: now on Dardan plains\n"+
		"The fresh and yet unbruised Greeks do pitch\n"+
		"Their brave pavilions: Priam's six-gated city,\n"+
		"Dardan, and Tymbria, Helias, Chetas, Troien,\n"+
		"And Antenorides, with massy staples\n"+
		"And corresponsive and fulfilling bolts,\n"+
		"Sperr up the sons of Troy.\n"+
		"Now expectation, tickling skittish spirits,\n"+
		"On one and other side, Trojan and Greek,\n"+
		"Sets all on hazard: and hither am I come\n"+
		"A prologue arm'd, but not in confidence\n"+
		"Of author's pen or actor's voice, but suited\n"+
		"In like conditions as our argument,\n"+
		"To tell you, fair beholders, that our play\n"+
		"Leaps o'er the vaunt and firstlings of those broils,\n"+
		"Beginning in the middle, starting thence away\n"+
		"To what may be digested in a play.\n"+
		"Like or find fault; do as your pleasures are:\n"+
		"Now good or bad, 'tis but the chance of war.\n"+
		"SCENE I. Troy. Before Priam's palace.\n"+
		"Enter TROILUS armed, and PANDARUS\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Call here my varlet; I'll unarm again:\n"+
		"Why should I war without the walls of Troy,\n"+
		"That find such cruel battle here within?\n"+
		"Each Trojan that is master of his heart,\n"+
		"Let him to field; Troilus, alas! hath none.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Will this gear ne'er be mended?\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"The Greeks are strong and skilful to their strength,\n"+
		"Fierce to their skill and to their fierceness valiant;\n"+
		"But I am weaker than a woman's tear,\n"+
		"Tamer than sleep, fonder than ignorance,\n"+
		"Less valiant than the virgin in the night\n"+
		"And skilless as unpractised infancy.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Well, I have told you enough of this: for my part,\n"+
		"I'll not meddle nor make no further. He that will\n"+
		"have a cake out of the wheat must needs tarry the grinding.\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Have I not tarried?\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Ay, the grinding; but you must tarry\n"+
		"the bolting.\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Have I not tarried?\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Ay, the bolting, but you must tarry the leavening.\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Still have I tarried.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Ay, to the leavening; but here's yet in the word\n"+
		"'hereafter' the kneading, the making of the cake, the\n"+
		"heating of the oven and the baking; nay, you must\n"+
		"stay the cooling too, or you may chance to burn your lips.\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Patience herself, what goddess e'er she be,\n"+
		"Doth lesser blench at sufferance than I do.\n"+
		"At Priam's royal table do I sit;\n"+
		"And when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts,--\n"+
		"So, traitor! 'When she comes!' When is she thence?\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Well, she looked yesternight fairer than ever I saw\n"+
		"her look, or any woman else.\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"I was about to tell thee:--when my heart,\n"+
		"As wedged with a sigh, would rive in twain,\n"+
		"Lest Hector or my father should perceive me,\n"+
		"I have, as when the sun doth light a storm,\n"+
		"Buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile:\n"+
		"But sorrow, that is couch'd in seeming gladness,\n"+
		"Is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"An her hair were not somewhat darker than Helen's--\n"+
		"well, go to--there were no more comparison between\n"+
		"the women: but, for my part, she is my kinswoman; I\n"+
		"would not, as they term it, praise her: but I would\n"+
		"somebody had heard her talk yesterday, as I did. I\n"+
		"will not dispraise your sister Cassandra's wit, but--\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"O Pandarus! I tell thee, Pandarus,--\n"+
		"When I do tell thee, there my hopes lie drown'd,\n"+
		"Reply not in how many fathoms deep\n"+
		"They lie indrench'd. I tell thee I am mad\n"+
		"In Cressid's love: thou answer'st 'she is fair;'\n"+
		"Pour'st in the open ulcer of my heart\n"+
		"Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,\n"+
		"Handlest in thy discourse, O, that her hand,\n"+
		"In whose comparison all whites are ink,\n"+
		"Writing their own reproach, to whose soft seizure\n"+
		"The cygnet's down is harsh and spirit of sense\n"+
		"Hard as the palm of ploughman: this thou tell'st me,\n"+
		"As true thou tell'st me, when I say I love her;\n"+
		"But, saying thus, instead of oil and balm,\n"+
		"Thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given me\n"+
		"The knife that made it.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"I speak no more than truth.\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Thou dost not speak so much.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Faith, I'll not meddle in't. Let her be as she is:\n"+
		"if she be fair, 'tis the better for her; an she be\n"+
		"not, she has the mends in her own hands.\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Good Pandarus, how now, Pandarus!\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"I have had my labour for my travail; ill-thought on of\n"+
		"her and ill-thought on of you; gone between and\n"+
		"between, but small thanks for my labour.\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"What, art thou angry, Pandarus? what, with me?\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Because she's kin to me, therefore she's not so fair\n"+
		"as Helen: an she were not kin to me, she would be as\n"+
		"fair on Friday as Helen is on Sunday. But what care\n"+
		"I? I care not an she were a black-a-moor; 'tis all one to me.\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Say I she is not fair?\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"I do not care whether you do or no. She's a fool to\n"+
		"stay behind her father; let her to the Greeks; and so\n"+
		"I'll tell her the next time I see her: for my part,\n"+
		"I'll meddle nor make no more i' the matter.\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Pandarus,--\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Not I.\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Sweet Pandarus,--\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Pray you, speak no more to me: I will leave all as I\n"+
		"found it, and there an end.\n"+
		"Exit PANDARUS. An alarum\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Peace, you ungracious clamours! peace, rude sounds!\n"+
		"Fools on both sides! Helen must needs be fair,\n"+
		"When with your blood you daily paint her thus.\n"+
		"I cannot fight upon this argument;\n"+
		"It is too starved a subject for my sword.\n"+
		"But Pandarus,--O gods, how do you plague me!\n"+
		"I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar;\n"+
		"And he's as tetchy to be woo'd to woo.\n"+
		"As she is stubborn-chaste against all suit.\n"+
		"Tell me, Apollo, for thy Daphne's love,\n"+
		"What Cressid is, what Pandar, and what we?\n"+
		"Her bed is India; there she lies, a pearl:\n"+
		"Between our Ilium and where she resides,\n"+
		"Let it be call'd the wild and wandering flood,\n"+
		"Ourself the merchant, and this sailing Pandar\n"+
		"Our doubtful hope, our convoy and our bark.\n"+
		"Alarum. Enter AENEAS\n"+
		"AENEAS\n"+
		"How now, Prince Troilus! wherefore not afield?\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Because not there: this woman's answer sorts,\n"+
		"For womanish it is to be from thence.\n"+
		"What news, AEneas, from the field to-day?\n"+
		"AENEAS\n"+
		"That Paris is returned home and hurt.\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"By whom, AEneas?\n"+
		"AENEAS\n"+
		"Troilus, by Menelaus.\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Let Paris bleed; 'tis but a scar to scorn;\n"+
		"Paris is gored with Menelaus' horn.\n"+
		"Alarum\n"+
		"AENEAS\n"+
		"Hark, what good sport is out of town to-day!\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Better at home, if 'would I might' were 'may.'\n"+
		"But to the sport abroad: are you bound thither?\n"+
		"AENEAS\n"+
		"In all swift haste.\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Come, go we then together.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. The Same. A street.\n"+
		"Enter CRESSIDA and ALEXANDER\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Who were those went by?\n"+
		"ALEXANDER\n"+
		"Queen Hecuba and Helen.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"And whither go they?\n"+
		"ALEXANDER\n"+
		"Up to the eastern tower,\n"+
		"Whose height commands as subject all the vale,\n"+
		"To see the battle. Hector, whose patience\n"+
		"Is, as a virtue, fix'd, to-day was moved:\n"+
		"He chid Andromache and struck his armourer,\n"+
		"And, like as there were husbandry in war,\n"+
		"Before the sun rose he was harness'd light,\n"+
		"And to the field goes he; where every flower\n"+
		"Did, as a prophet, weep what it foresaw\n"+
		"In Hector's wrath.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"What was his cause of anger?\n"+
		"ALEXANDER\n"+
		"The noise goes, this: there is among the Greeks\n"+
		"A lord of Trojan blood, nephew to Hector;\n"+
		"They call him Ajax.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Good; and what of him?\n"+
		"ALEXANDER\n"+
		"They say he is a very man per se,\n"+
		"And stands alone.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"So do all men, unless they are drunk, sick, or have no legs.\n"+
		"ALEXANDER\n"+
		"This man, lady, hath robbed many beasts of their\n"+
		"particular additions; he is as valiant as the lion,\n"+
		"churlish as the bear, slow as the elephant: a man\n"+
		"into whom nature hath so crowded humours that his\n"+
		"valour is crushed into folly, his folly sauced with\n"+
		"discretion: there is no man hath a virtue that he\n"+
		"hath not a glimpse of, nor any man an attaint but he\n"+
		"carries some stain of it: he is melancholy without\n"+
		"cause, and merry against the hair: he hath the\n"+
		"joints of every thing, but everything so out of joint\n"+
		"that he is a gouty Briareus, many hands and no use,\n"+
		"or purblind Argus, all eyes and no sight.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"But how should this man, that makes\n"+
		"me smile, make Hector angry?\n"+
		"ALEXANDER\n"+
		"They say he yesterday coped Hector in the battle and\n"+
		"struck him down, the disdain and shame whereof hath\n"+
		"ever since kept Hector fasting and waking.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Who comes here?\n"+
		"ALEXANDER\n"+
		"Madam, your uncle Pandarus.\n"+
		"Enter PANDARUS\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Hector's a gallant man.\n"+
		"ALEXANDER\n"+
		"As may be in the world, lady.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"What's that? what's that?\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Good morrow, uncle Pandarus.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Good morrow, cousin Cressid: what do you talk of?\n"+
		"Good morrow, Alexander. How do you, cousin? When\n"+
		"were you at Ilium?\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"This morning, uncle.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"What were you talking of when I came? Was Hector\n"+
		"armed and gone ere ye came to Ilium? Helen was not\n"+
		"up, was she?\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Hector was gone, but Helen was not up.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Even so: Hector was stirring early.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"That were we talking of, and of his anger.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Was he angry?\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"So he says here.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"True, he was so: I know the cause too: he'll lay\n"+
		"about him to-day, I can tell them that: and there's\n"+
		"Troilus will not come far behind him: let them take\n"+
		"heed of Troilus, I can tell them that too.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"What, is he angry too?\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Who, Troilus? Troilus is the better man of the two.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"O Jupiter! there's no comparison.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"What, not between Troilus and Hector? Do you know a\n"+
		"man if you see him?\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Ay, if I ever saw him before and knew him.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Well, I say Troilus is Troilus.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Then you say as I say; for, I am sure, he is not Hector.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"No, nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"'Tis just to each of them; he is himself.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Himself! Alas, poor Troilus! I would he were.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"So he is.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Condition, I had gone barefoot to India.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"He is not Hector.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Himself! no, he's not himself: would a' were\n"+
		"himself! Well, the gods are above; time must friend\n"+
		"or end: well, Troilus, well: I would my heart were\n"+
		"in her body. No, Hector is not a better man than Troilus.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Excuse me.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"He is elder.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Pardon me, pardon me.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Th' other's not come to't; you shall tell me another\n"+
		"tale, when th' other's come to't. Hector shall not\n"+
		"have his wit this year.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"He shall not need it, if he have his own.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Nor his qualities.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"No matter.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Nor his beauty.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"'Twould not become him; his own's better.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"You have no judgment, niece: Helen\n"+
		"herself swore th' other day, that Troilus, for\n"+
		"a brown favour--for so 'tis, I must confess,--\n"+
		"not brown neither,--\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"No, but brown.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"'Faith, to say truth, brown and not brown.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"To say the truth, true and not true.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"She praised his complexion above Paris.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Why, Paris hath colour enough.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"So he has.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Then Troilus should have too much: if she praised\n"+
		"him above, his complexion is higher than his; he\n"+
		"having colour enough, and the other higher, is too\n"+
		"flaming a praise for a good complexion. I had as\n"+
		"lief Helen's golden tongue had commended Troilus for\n"+
		"a copper nose.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"I swear to you. I think Helen loves him better than Paris.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Then she's a merry Greek indeed.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Nay, I am sure she does. She came to him th' other\n"+
		"day into the compassed window,--and, you know, he\n"+
		"has not past three or four hairs on his chin,--\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Indeed, a tapster's arithmetic may soon bring his\n"+
		"particulars therein to a total.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Why, he is very young: and yet will he, within\n"+
		"three pound, lift as much as his brother Hector.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Is he so young a man and so old a lifter?\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"But to prove to you that Helen loves him: she came\n"+
		"and puts me her white hand to his cloven chin--\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Juno have mercy! how came it cloven?\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Why, you know 'tis dimpled: I think his smiling\n"+
		"becomes him better than any man in all Phrygia.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"O, he smiles valiantly.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Does he not?\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"O yes, an 'twere a cloud in autumn.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Why, go to, then: but to prove to you that Helen\n"+
		"loves Troilus,--\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Troilus will stand to the proof, if you'll\n"+
		"prove it so.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Troilus! why, he esteems her no more than I esteem\n"+
		"an addle egg.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"If you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle\n"+
		"head, you would eat chickens i' the shell.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"I cannot choose but laugh, to think how she tickled\n"+
		"his chin: indeed, she has a marvellous white hand, I\n"+
		"must needs confess,--\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Without the rack.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"And she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Alas, poor chin! many a wart is richer.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"But there was such laughing! Queen Hecuba laughed\n"+
		"that her eyes ran o'er.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"With mill-stones.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"And Cassandra laughed.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"But there was more temperate fire under the pot of\n"+
		"her eyes: did her eyes run o'er too?\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"And Hector laughed.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"At what was all this laughing?\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Marry, at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus' chin.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"An't had been a green hair, I should have laughed\n"+
		"too.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"They laughed not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"What was his answer?\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Quoth she, 'Here's but two and fifty hairs on your\n"+
		"chin, and one of them is white.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"This is her question.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"That's true; make no question of that. 'Two and\n"+
		"fifty hairs' quoth he, 'and one white: that white\n"+
		"hair is my father, and all the rest are his sons.'\n"+
		"'Jupiter!' quoth she, 'which of these hairs is Paris,\n"+
		"my husband? 'The forked one,' quoth he, 'pluck't\n"+
		"out, and give it him.' But there was such laughing!\n"+
		"and Helen so blushed, an Paris so chafed, and all the\n"+
		"rest so laughed, that it passed.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"So let it now; for it has been while going by.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Well, cousin. I told you a thing yesterday; think on't.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"So I do.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"I'll be sworn 'tis true; he will weep you, an 'twere\n"+
		"a man born in April.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"And I'll spring up in his tears, an 'twere a nettle\n"+
		"against May.\n"+
		"A retreat sounded\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Hark! they are coming from the field: shall we\n"+
		"stand up here, and see them as they pass toward\n"+
		"Ilium? good niece, do, sweet niece Cressida.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"At your pleasure.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Here, here, here's an excellent place; here we may\n"+
		"see most bravely: I'll tell you them all by their\n"+
		"names as they pass by; but mark Troilus above the rest.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Speak not so loud.\n"+
		"AENEAS passes\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"That's AEneas: is not that a brave man? he's one of\n"+
		"the flowers of Troy, I can tell you: but mark\n"+
		"Troilus; you shall see anon.\n"+
		"ANTENOR passes\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Who's that?\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"That's Antenor: he has a shrewd wit, I can tell you;\n"+
		"and he's a man good enough, he's one o' the soundest\n"+
		"judgments in whosoever, and a proper man of person.\n"+
		"When comes Troilus? I'll show you Troilus anon: if\n"+
		"he see me, you shall see him nod at me.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Will he give you the nod?\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"You shall see.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"If he do, the rich shall have more.\n"+
		"HECTOR passes\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"That's Hector, that, that, look you, that; there's a\n"+
		"fellow! Go thy way, Hector! There's a brave man,\n"+
		"niece. O brave Hector! Look how he looks! there's\n"+
		"a countenance! is't not a brave man?\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"O, a brave man!\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Is a' not? it does a man's heart good. Look you\n"+
		"what hacks are on his helmet! look you yonder, do\n"+
		"you see? look you there: there's no jesting;\n"+
		"there's laying on, take't off who will, as they say:\n"+
		"there be hacks!\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Be those with swords?\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Swords! any thing, he cares not; an the devil come\n"+
		"to him, it's all one: by God's lid, it does one's\n"+
		"heart good. Yonder comes Paris, yonder comes Paris.\n"+
		"PARIS passes\n"+
		"Look ye yonder, niece; is't not a gallant man too,\n"+
		"is't not? Why, this is brave now. Who said he came\n"+
		"hurt home to-day? he's not hurt: why, this will do\n"+
		"Helen's heart good now, ha! Would I could see\n"+
		"Troilus now! You shall see Troilus anon.\n"+
		"HELENUS passes\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Who's that?\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"That's Helenus. I marvel where Troilus is. That's\n"+
		"Helenus. I think he went not forth to-day. That's Helenus.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Can Helenus fight, uncle?\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Helenus? no. Yes, he'll fight indifferent well. I\n"+
		"marvel where Troilus is. Hark! do you not hear the\n"+
		"people cry 'Troilus'? Helenus is a priest.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"What sneaking fellow comes yonder?\n"+
		"TROILUS passes\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Where? yonder? that's Deiphobus. 'Tis Troilus!\n"+
		"there's a man, niece! Hem! Brave Troilus! the\n"+
		"prince of chivalry!\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Peace, for shame, peace!\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Mark him; note him. O brave Troilus! Look well upon\n"+
		"him, niece: look you how his sword is bloodied, and\n"+
		"his helm more hacked than Hector's, and how he looks,\n"+
		"and how he goes! O admirable youth! he ne'er saw\n"+
		"three and twenty. Go thy way, Troilus, go thy way!\n"+
		"Had I a sister were a grace, or a daughter a goddess,\n"+
		"he should take his choice. O admirable man! Paris?\n"+
		"Paris is dirt to him; and, I warrant, Helen, to\n"+
		"change, would give an eye to boot.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Here come more.\n"+
		"Forces pass\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Asses, fools, dolts! chaff and bran, chaff and bran!\n"+
		"porridge after meat! I could live and die i' the\n"+
		"eyes of Troilus. Ne'er look, ne'er look: the eagles\n"+
		"are gone: crows and daws, crows and daws! I had\n"+
		"rather be such a man as Troilus than Agamemnon and\n"+
		"all Greece.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"There is among the Greeks Achilles, a better man than Troilus.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Achilles! a drayman, a porter, a very camel.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Well, well.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"'Well, well!' why, have you any discretion? have\n"+
		"you any eyes? Do you know what a man is? Is not\n"+
		"birth, beauty, good shape, discourse, manhood,\n"+
		"learning, gentleness, virtue, youth, liberality,\n"+
		"and such like, the spice and salt that season a man?\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Ay, a minced man: and then to be baked with no date\n"+
		"in the pie, for then the man's date's out.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"You are such a woman! one knows not at what ward you\n"+
		"lie.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Upon my back, to defend my belly; upon my wit, to\n"+
		"defend my wiles; upon my secrecy, to defend mine\n"+
		"honesty; my mask, to defend my beauty; and you, to\n"+
		"defend all these: and at all these wards I lie, at a\n"+
		"thousand watches.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Say one of your watches.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Nay, I'll watch you for that; and that's one of the\n"+
		"chiefest of them too: if I cannot ward what I would\n"+
		"not have hit, I can watch you for telling how I took\n"+
		"the blow; unless it swell past hiding, and then it's\n"+
		"past watching.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"You are such another!\n"+
		"Enter Troilus's Boy\n"+
		"Boy\n"+
		"Sir, my lord would instantly speak with you.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Where?\n"+
		"Boy\n"+
		"At your own house; there he unarms him.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Good boy, tell him I come.\n"+
		"Exit boy\n"+
		"I doubt he be hurt. Fare ye well, good niece.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Adieu, uncle.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"I'll be with you, niece, by and by.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"To bring, uncle?\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Ay, a token from Troilus.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"By the same token, you are a bawd.\n"+
		"Exit PANDARUS\n"+
		"Words, vows, gifts, tears, and love's full sacrifice,\n"+
		"He offers in another's enterprise;\n"+
		"But more in Troilus thousand fold I see\n"+
		"Than in the glass of Pandar's praise may be;\n"+
		"Yet hold I off. Women are angels, wooing:\n"+
		"Things won are done; joy's soul lies in the doing.\n"+
		"That she beloved knows nought that knows not this:\n"+
		"Men prize the thing ungain'd more than it is:\n"+
		"That she was never yet that ever knew\n"+
		"Love got so sweet as when desire did sue.\n"+
		"Therefore this maxim out of love I teach:\n"+
		"Achievement is command; ungain'd, beseech:\n"+
		"Then though my heart's content firm love doth bear,\n"+
		"Nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. The Grecian camp. Before Agamemnon's tent.\n"+
		"Sennet. Enter AGAMEMNON, NESTOR, ULYSSES, MENELAUS, and others\n"+
		"AGAMEMNON\n"+
		"Princes,\n"+
		"What grief hath set the jaundice on your cheeks?\n"+
		"The ample proposition that hope makes\n"+
		"In all designs begun on earth below\n"+
		"Fails in the promised largeness: cheques and disasters\n"+
		"Grow in the veins of actions highest rear'd,\n"+
		"As knots, by the conflux of meeting sap,\n"+
		"Infect the sound pine and divert his grain\n"+
		"Tortive and errant from his course of growth.\n"+
		"Nor, princes, is it matter new to us\n"+
		"That we come short of our suppose so far\n"+
		"That after seven years' siege yet Troy walls stand;\n"+
		"Sith every action that hath gone before,\n"+
		"Whereof we have record, trial did draw\n"+
		"Bias and thwart, not answering the aim,\n"+
		"And that unbodied figure of the thought\n"+
		"That gave't surmised shape. Why then, you princes,\n"+
		"Do you with cheeks abash'd behold our works,\n"+
		"And call them shames? which are indeed nought else\n"+
		"But the protractive trials of great Jove\n"+
		"To find persistive constancy in men:\n"+
		"The fineness of which metal is not found\n"+
		"In fortune's love; for then the bold and coward,\n"+
		"The wise and fool, the artist and unread,\n"+
		"The hard and soft seem all affined and kin:\n"+
		"But, in the wind and tempest of her frown,\n"+
		"Distinction, with a broad and powerful fan,\n"+
		"Puffing at all, winnows the light away;\n"+
		"And what hath mass or matter, by itself\n"+
		"Lies rich in virtue and unmingled.\n"+
		"NESTOR\n"+
		"With due observance of thy godlike seat,\n"+
		"Great Agamemnon, Nestor shall apply\n"+
		"Thy latest words. In the reproof of chance\n"+
		"Lies the true proof of men: the sea being smooth,\n"+
		"How many shallow bauble boats dare sail\n"+
		"Upon her patient breast, making their way\n"+
		"With those of nobler bulk!\n"+
		"But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage\n"+
		"The gentle Thetis, and anon behold\n"+
		"The strong-ribb'd bark through liquid mountains cut,\n"+
		"Bounding between the two moist elements,\n"+
		"Like Perseus' horse: where's then the saucy boat\n"+
		"Whose weak untimber'd sides but even now\n"+
		"Co-rivall'd greatness? Either to harbour fled,\n"+
		"Or made a toast for Neptune. Even so\n"+
		"Doth valour's show and valour's worth divide\n"+
		"In storms of fortune; for in her ray and brightness\n"+
		"The herd hath more annoyance by the breeze\n"+
		"Than by the tiger; but when the splitting wind\n"+
		"Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks,\n"+
		"And flies fled under shade, why, then the thing of courage\n"+
		"As roused with rage with rage doth sympathize,\n"+
		"And with an accent tuned in selfsame key\n"+
		"Retorts to chiding fortune.\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"Agamemnon,\n"+
		"Thou great commander, nerve and bone of Greece,\n"+
		"Heart of our numbers, soul and only spirit.\n"+
		"In whom the tempers and the minds of all\n"+
		"Should be shut up, hear what Ulysses speaks.\n"+
		"Besides the applause and approbation To which,\n"+
		"To AGAMEMNON\n"+
		"most mighty for thy place and sway,\n"+
		"To NESTOR\n"+
		"And thou most reverend for thy stretch'd-out life\n"+
		"I give to both your speeches, which were such\n"+
		"As Agamemnon and the hand of Greece\n"+
		"Should hold up high in brass, and such again\n"+
		"As venerable Nestor, hatch'd in silver,\n"+
		"Should with a bond of air, strong as the axle-tree\n"+
		"On which heaven rides, knit all the Greekish ears\n"+
		"To his experienced tongue, yet let it please both,\n"+
		"Thou great, and wise, to hear Ulysses speak.\n"+
		"AGAMEMNON\n"+
		"Speak, prince of Ithaca; and be't of less expect\n"+
		"That matter needless, of importless burden,\n"+
		"Divide thy lips, than we are confident,\n"+
		"When rank Thersites opes his mastic jaws,\n"+
		"We shall hear music, wit and oracle.\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"Troy, yet upon his basis, had been down,\n"+
		"And the great Hector's sword had lack'd a master,\n"+
		"But for these instances.\n"+
		"The specialty of rule hath been neglected:\n"+
		"And, look, how many Grecian tents do stand\n"+
		"Hollow upon this plain, so many hollow factions.\n"+
		"When that the general is not like the hive\n"+
		"To whom the foragers shall all repair,\n"+
		"What honey is expected? Degree being vizarded,\n"+
		"The unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask.\n"+
		"The heavens themselves, the planets and this centre\n"+
		"Observe degree, priority and place,\n"+
		"Insisture, course, proportion, season, form,\n"+
		"Office and custom, in all line of order;\n"+
		"And therefore is the glorious planet Sol\n"+
		"In noble eminence enthroned and sphered\n"+
		"Amidst the other; whose medicinable eye\n"+
		"Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil,\n"+
		"And posts, like the commandment of a king,\n"+
		"Sans cheque to good and bad: but when the planets\n"+
		"In evil mixture to disorder wander,\n"+
		"What plagues and what portents! what mutiny!\n"+
		"What raging of the sea! shaking of earth!\n"+
		"Commotion in the winds! frights, changes, horrors,\n"+
		"Divert and crack, rend and deracinate\n"+
		"The unity and married calm of states\n"+
		"Quite from their fixure! O, when degree is shaked,\n"+
		"Which is the ladder to all high designs,\n"+
		"Then enterprise is sick! How could communities,\n"+
		"Degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities,\n"+
		"Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,\n"+
		"The primogenitive and due of birth,\n"+
		"Prerogative of age, crowns, sceptres, laurels,\n"+
		"But by degree, stand in authentic place?\n"+
		"Take but degree away, untune that string,\n"+
		"And, hark, what discord follows! each thing meets\n"+
		"In mere oppugnancy: the bounded waters\n"+
		"Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores\n"+
		"And make a sop of all this solid globe:\n"+
		"Strength should be lord of imbecility,\n"+
		"And the rude son should strike his father dead:\n"+
		"Force should be right; or rather, right and wrong,\n"+
		"Between whose endless jar justice resides,\n"+
		"Should lose their names, and so should justice too.\n"+
		"Then every thing includes itself in power,\n"+
		"Power into will, will into appetite;\n"+
		"And appetite, an universal wolf,\n"+
		"So doubly seconded with will and power,\n"+
		"Must make perforce an universal prey,\n"+
		"And last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,\n"+
		"This chaos, when degree is suffocate,\n"+
		"Follows the choking.\n"+
		"And this neglection of degree it is\n"+
		"That by a pace goes backward, with a purpose\n"+
		"It hath to climb. The general's disdain'd\n"+
		"By him one step below, he by the next,\n"+
		"That next by him beneath; so every step,\n"+
		"Exampled by the first pace that is sick\n"+
		"Of his superior, grows to an envious fever\n"+
		"Of pale and bloodless emulation:\n"+
		"And 'tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot,\n"+
		"Not her own sinews. To end a tale of length,\n"+
		"Troy in our weakness stands, not in her strength.\n"+
		"NESTOR\n"+
		"Most wisely hath Ulysses here discover'd\n"+
		"The fever whereof all our power is sick.\n"+
		"AGAMEMNON\n"+
		"The nature of the sickness found, Ulysses,\n"+
		"What is the remedy?\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"The great Achilles, whom opinion crowns\n"+
		"The sinew and the forehand of our host,\n"+
		"Having his ear full of his airy fame,\n"+
		"Grows dainty of his worth, and in his tent\n"+
		"Lies mocking our designs: with him Patroclus\n"+
		"Upon a lazy bed the livelong day\n"+
		"Breaks scurril jests;\n"+
		"And with ridiculous and awkward action,\n"+
		"Which, slanderer, he imitation calls,\n"+
		"He pageants us. Sometime, great Agamemnon,\n"+
		"Thy topless deputation he puts on,\n"+
		"And, like a strutting player, whose conceit\n"+
		"Lies in his hamstring, and doth think it rich\n"+
		"To hear the wooden dialogue and sound\n"+
		"'Twixt his stretch'd footing and the scaffoldage,--\n"+
		"Such to-be-pitied and o'er-wrested seeming\n"+
		"He acts thy greatness in: and when he speaks,\n"+
		"'Tis like a chime a-mending; with terms unsquared,\n"+
		"Which, from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropp'd\n"+
		"Would seem hyperboles. At this fusty stuff\n"+
		"The large Achilles, on his press'd bed lolling,\n"+
		"From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause;\n"+
		"Cries 'Excellent! 'tis Agamemnon just.\n"+
		"Now play me Nestor; hem, and stroke thy beard,\n"+
		"As he being drest to some oration.'\n"+
		"That's done, as near as the extremest ends\n"+
		"Of parallels, as like as Vulcan and his wife:\n"+
		"Yet god Achilles still cries 'Excellent!\n"+
		"'Tis Nestor right. Now play him me, Patroclus,\n"+
		"Arming to answer in a night alarm.'\n"+
		"And then, forsooth, the faint defects of age\n"+
		"Must be the scene of mirth; to cough and spit,\n"+
		"And, with a palsy-fumbling on his gorget,\n"+
		"Shake in and out the rivet: and at this sport\n"+
		"Sir Valour dies; cries 'O, enough, Patroclus;\n"+
		"Or give me ribs of steel! I shall split all\n"+
		"In pleasure of my spleen.' And in this fashion,\n"+
		"All our abilities, gifts, natures, shapes,\n"+
		"Severals and generals of grace exact,\n"+
		"Achievements, plots, orders, preventions,\n"+
		"Excitements to the field, or speech for truce,\n"+
		"Success or loss, what is or is not, serves\n"+
		"As stuff for these two to make paradoxes.\n"+
		"NESTOR\n"+
		"And in the imitation of these twain--\n"+
		"Who, as Ulysses says, opinion crowns\n"+
		"With an imperial voice--many are infect.\n"+
		"Ajax is grown self-will'd, and bears his head\n"+
		"In such a rein, in full as proud a place\n"+
		"As broad Achilles; keeps his tent like him;\n"+
		"Makes factious feasts; rails on our state of war,\n"+
		"Bold as an oracle, and sets Thersites,\n"+
		"A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint,\n"+
		"To match us in comparisons with dirt,\n"+
		"To weaken and discredit our exposure,\n"+
		"How rank soever rounded in with danger.\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"They tax our policy, and call it cowardice,\n"+
		"Count wisdom as no member of the war,\n"+
		"Forestall prescience, and esteem no act\n"+
		"But that of hand: the still and mental parts,\n"+
		"That do contrive how many hands shall strike,\n"+
		"When fitness calls them on, and know by measure\n"+
		"Of their observant toil the enemies' weight,--\n"+
		"Why, this hath not a finger's dignity:\n"+
		"They call this bed-work, mappery, closet-war;\n"+
		"So that the ram that batters down the wall,\n"+
		"For the great swing and rudeness of his poise,\n"+
		"They place before his hand that made the engine,\n"+
		"Or those that with the fineness of their souls\n"+
		"By reason guide his execution.\n"+
		"NESTOR\n"+
		"Let this be granted, and Achilles' horse\n"+
		"Makes many Thetis' sons.\n"+
		"A tucket\n"+
		"AGAMEMNON\n"+
		"What trumpet? look, Menelaus.\n"+
		"MENELAUS\n"+
		"From Troy.\n"+
		"Enter AENEAS\n"+
		"AGAMEMNON\n"+
		"What would you 'fore our tent?\n"+
		"AENEAS\n"+
		"Is this great Agamemnon's tent, I pray you?\n"+
		"AGAMEMNON\n"+
		"Even this.\n"+
		"AENEAS\n"+
		"May one, that is a herald and a prince,\n"+
		"Do a fair message to his kingly ears?\n"+
		"AGAMEMNON\n"+
		"With surety stronger than Achilles' arm\n"+
		"'Fore all the Greekish heads, which with one voice\n"+
		"Call Agamemnon head and general.\n"+
		"AENEAS\n"+
		"Fair leave and large security. How may\n"+
		"A stranger to those most imperial looks\n"+
		"Know them from eyes of other mortals?\n"+
		"AGAMEMNON\n"+
		"How!\n"+
		"AENEAS\n"+
		"Ay;\n"+
		"I ask, that I might waken reverence,\n"+
		"And bid the cheek be ready with a blush\n"+
		"Modest as morning when she coldly eyes\n"+
		"The youthful Phoebus:\n"+
		"Which is that god in office, guiding men?\n"+
		"Which is the high and mighty Agamemnon?\n"+
		"AGAMEMNON\n"+
		"This Trojan scorns us; or the men of Troy\n"+
		"Are ceremonious courtiers.\n"+
		"AENEAS\n"+
		"Courtiers as free, as debonair, unarm'd,\n"+
		"As bending angels; that's their fame in peace:\n"+
		"But when they would seem soldiers, they have galls,\n"+
		"Good arms, strong joints, true swords; and,\n"+
		"Jove's accord,\n"+
		"Nothing so full of heart. But peace, AEneas,\n"+
		"Peace, Trojan; lay thy finger on thy lips!\n"+
		"The worthiness of praise distains his worth,\n"+
		"If that the praised himself bring the praise forth:\n"+
		"But what the repining enemy commends,\n"+
		"That breath fame blows; that praise, sole sure,\n"+
		"transcends.\n"+
		"AGAMEMNON\n"+
		"Sir, you of Troy, call you yourself AEneas?\n"+
		"AENEAS\n"+
		"Ay, Greek, that is my name.\n"+
		"AGAMEMNON\n"+
		"What's your affair I pray you?\n"+
		"AENEAS\n"+
		"Sir, pardon; 'tis for Agamemnon's ears.\n"+
		"AGAMEMNON\n"+
		"He hears naught privately that comes from Troy.\n"+
		"AENEAS\n"+
		"Nor I from Troy come not to whisper him:\n"+
		"I bring a trumpet to awake his ear,\n"+
		"To set his sense on the attentive bent,\n"+
		"And then to speak.\n"+
		"AGAMEMNON\n"+
		"Speak frankly as the wind;\n"+
		"It is not Agamemnon's sleeping hour:\n"+
		"That thou shalt know. Trojan, he is awake,\n"+
		"He tells thee so himself.\n"+
		"AENEAS\n"+
		"Trumpet, blow loud,\n"+
		"Send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents;\n"+
		"And every Greek of mettle, let him know,\n"+
		"What Troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud.\n"+
		"Trumpet sounds\n"+
		"We have, great Agamemnon, here in Troy\n"+
		"A prince call'd Hector,--Priam is his father,--\n"+
		"Who in this dull and long-continued truce\n"+
		"Is rusty grown: he bade me take a trumpet,\n"+
		"And to this purpose speak. Kings, princes, lords!\n"+
		"If there be one among the fair'st of Greece\n"+
		"That holds his honour higher than his ease,\n"+
		"That seeks his praise more than he fears his peril,\n"+
		"That knows his valour, and knows not his fear,\n"+
		"That loves his mistress more than in confession,\n"+
		"With truant vows to her own lips he loves,\n"+
		"And dare avow her beauty and her worth\n"+
		"In other arms than hers,--to him this challenge.\n"+
		"Hector, in view of Trojans and of Greeks,\n"+
		"Shall make it good, or do his best to do it,\n"+
		"He hath a lady, wiser, fairer, truer,\n"+
		"Than ever Greek did compass in his arms,\n"+
		"And will to-morrow with his trumpet call\n"+
		"Midway between your tents and walls of Troy,\n"+
		"To rouse a Grecian that is true in love:\n"+
		"If any come, Hector shall honour him;\n"+
		"If none, he'll say in Troy when he retires,\n"+
		"The Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth\n"+
		"The splinter of a lance. Even so much.\n"+
		"AGAMEMNON\n"+
		"This shall be told our lovers, Lord AEneas;\n"+
		"If none of them have soul in such a kind,\n"+
		"We left them all at home: but we are soldiers;\n"+
		"And may that soldier a mere recreant prove,\n"+
		"That means not, hath not, or is not in love!\n"+
		"If then one is, or hath, or means to be,\n"+
		"That one meets Hector; if none else, I am he.\n"+
		"NESTOR\n"+
		"Tell him of Nestor, one that was a man\n"+
		"When Hector's grandsire suck'd: he is old now;\n"+
		"But if there be not in our Grecian host\n"+
		"One noble man that hath one spark of fire,\n"+
		"To answer for his love, tell him from me\n"+
		"I'll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver\n"+
		"And in my vantbrace put this wither'd brawn,\n"+
		"And meeting him will tell him that my lady\n"+
		"Was fairer than his grandam and as chaste\n"+
		"As may be in the world: his youth in flood,\n"+
		"I'll prove this truth with my three drops of blood.\n"+
		"AENEAS\n"+
		"Now heavens forbid such scarcity of youth!\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"Amen.\n"+
		"AGAMEMNON\n"+
		"Fair Lord AEneas, let me touch your hand;\n"+
		"To our pavilion shall I lead you, sir.\n"+
		"Achilles shall have word of this intent;\n"+
		"So shall each lord of Greece, from tent to tent:\n"+
		"Yourself shall feast with us before you go\n"+
		"And find the welcome of a noble foe.\n"+
		"Exeunt all but ULYSSES and NESTOR\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"Nestor!\n"+
		"NESTOR\n"+
		"What says Ulysses?\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"I have a young conception in my brain;\n"+
		"Be you my time to bring it to some shape.\n"+
		"NESTOR\n"+
		"What is't?\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"This 'tis:\n"+
		"Blunt wedges rive hard knots: the seeded pride\n"+
		"That hath to this maturity blown up\n"+
		"In rank Achilles must or now be cropp'd,\n"+
		"Or, shedding, breed a nursery of like evil,\n"+
		"To overbulk us all.\n"+
		"NESTOR\n"+
		"Well, and how?\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"This challenge that the gallant Hector sends,\n"+
		"However it is spread in general name,\n"+
		"Relates in purpose only to Achilles.\n"+
		"NESTOR\n"+
		"The purpose is perspicuous even as substance,\n"+
		"Whose grossness little characters sum up:\n"+
		"And, in the publication, make no strain,\n"+
		"But that Achilles, were his brain as barren\n"+
		"As banks of Libya,--though, Apollo knows,\n"+
		"'Tis dry enough,--will, with great speed of judgment,\n"+
		"Ay, with celerity, find Hector's purpose\n"+
		"Pointing on him.\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"And wake him to the answer, think you?\n"+
		"NESTOR\n"+
		"Yes, 'tis most meet: whom may you else oppose,\n"+
		"That can from Hector bring his honour off,\n"+
		"If not Achilles? Though't be a sportful combat,\n"+
		"Yet in the trial much opinion dwells;\n"+
		"For here the Trojans taste our dear'st repute\n"+
		"With their finest palate: and trust to me, Ulysses,\n"+
		"Our imputation shall be oddly poised\n"+
		"In this wild action; for the success,\n"+
		"Although particular, shall give a scantling\n"+
		"Of good or bad unto the general;\n"+
		"And in such indexes, although small pricks\n"+
		"To their subsequent volumes, there is seen\n"+
		"The baby figure of the giant mass\n"+
		"Of things to come at large. It is supposed\n"+
		"He that meets Hector issues from our choice\n"+
		"And choice, being mutual act of all our souls,\n"+
		"Makes merit her election, and doth boil,\n"+
		"As 'twere from us all, a man distill'd\n"+
		"Out of our virtues; who miscarrying,\n"+
		"What heart receives from hence the conquering part,\n"+
		"To steel a strong opinion to themselves?\n"+
		"Which entertain'd, limbs are his instruments,\n"+
		"In no less working than are swords and bows\n"+
		"Directive by the limbs.\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"Give pardon to my speech:\n"+
		"Therefore 'tis meet Achilles meet not Hector.\n"+
		"Let us, like merchants, show our foulest wares,\n"+
		"And think, perchance, they'll sell; if not,\n"+
		"The lustre of the better yet to show,\n"+
		"Shall show the better. Do not consent\n"+
		"That ever Hector and Achilles meet;\n"+
		"For both our honour and our shame in this\n"+
		"Are dogg'd with two strange followers.\n"+
		"NESTOR\n"+
		"I see them not with my old eyes: what are they?\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"What glory our Achilles shares from Hector,\n"+
		"Were he not proud, we all should share with him:\n"+
		"But he already is too insolent;\n"+
		"A nd we were better parch in Afric sun\n"+
		"Than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes,\n"+
		"Should he 'scape Hector fair: if he were foil'd,\n"+
		"Why then, we did our main opinion crush\n"+
		"In taint of our best man. No, make a lottery;\n"+
		"And, by device, let blockish Ajax draw\n"+
		"The sort to fight with Hector: among ourselves\n"+
		"Give him allowance for the better man;\n"+
		"For that will physic the great Myrmidon\n"+
		"Who broils in loud applause, and make him fall\n"+
		"His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends.\n"+
		"If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off,\n"+
		"We'll dress him up in voices: if he fail,\n"+
		"Yet go we under our opinion still\n"+
		"That we have better men. But, hit or miss,\n"+
		"Our project's life this shape of sense assumes:\n"+
		"Ajax employ'd plucks down Achilles' plumes.\n"+
		"NESTOR\n"+
		"Ulysses,\n"+
		"Now I begin to relish thy advice;\n"+
		"And I will give a taste of it forthwith\n"+
		"To Agamemnon: go we to him straight.\n"+
		"Two curs shall tame each other: pride alone\n"+
		"Must tarre the mastiffs on, as 'twere their bone.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT II\n"+
		"SCENE I. A part of the Grecian camp.\n"+
		"Enter AJAX and THERSITES\n"+
		"AJAX\n"+
		"Thersites!\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"Agamemnon, how if he had boils? full, all over,\n"+
		"generally?\n"+
		"AJAX\n"+
		"Thersites!\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"And those boils did run? say so: did not the\n"+
		"general run then? were not that a botchy core?\n"+
		"AJAX\n"+
		"Dog!\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"Then would come some matter from him; I see none now.\n"+
		"AJAX\n"+
		"Thou bitch-wolf's son, canst thou not hear?\n"+
		"Beating him\n"+
		"Feel, then.\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"The plague of Greece upon thee, thou mongrel\n"+
		"beef-witted lord!\n"+
		"AJAX\n"+
		"Speak then, thou vinewedst leaven, speak: I will\n"+
		"beat thee into handsomeness.\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"I shall sooner rail thee into wit and holiness: but,\n"+
		"I think, thy horse will sooner con an oration than\n"+
		"thou learn a prayer without book. Thou canst strike,\n"+
		"canst thou? a red murrain o' thy jade's tricks!\n"+
		"AJAX\n"+
		"Toadstool, learn me the proclamation.\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"Dost thou think I have no sense, thou strikest me thus?\n"+
		"AJAX\n"+
		"The proclamation!\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"Thou art proclaimed a fool, I think.\n"+
		"AJAX\n"+
		"Do not, porpentine, do not: my fingers itch.\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"I would thou didst itch from head to foot and I had\n"+
		"the scratching of thee; I would make thee the\n"+
		"loathsomest scab in Greece. When thou art forth in\n"+
		"the incursions, thou strikest as slow as another.\n"+
		"AJAX\n"+
		"I say, the proclamation!\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"Thou grumblest and railest every hour on Achilles,\n"+
		"and thou art as full of envy at his greatness as\n"+
		"Cerberus is at Proserpine's beauty, ay, that thou\n"+
		"barkest at him.\n"+
		"AJAX\n"+
		"Mistress Thersites!\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"Thou shouldest strike him.\n"+
		"AJAX\n"+
		"Cobloaf!\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"He would pun thee into shivers with his fist, as a\n"+
		"sailor breaks a biscuit.\n"+
		"AJAX\n"+
		"[Beating him] You whoreson cur!\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"Do, do.\n"+
		"AJAX\n"+
		"Thou stool for a witch!\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"Ay, do, do; thou sodden-witted lord! thou hast no\n"+
		"more brain than I have in mine elbows; an assinego\n"+
		"may tutor thee: thou scurvy-valiant ass! thou art\n"+
		"here but to thrash Trojans; and thou art bought and\n"+
		"sold among those of any wit, like a barbarian slave.\n"+
		"If thou use to beat me, I will begin at thy heel, and\n"+
		"tell what thou art by inches, thou thing of no\n"+
		"bowels, thou!\n"+
		"AJAX\n"+
		"You dog!\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"You scurvy lord!\n"+
		"AJAX\n"+
		"[Beating him] You cur!\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"Mars his idiot! do, rudeness; do, camel; do, do.\n"+
		"Enter ACHILLES and PATROCLUS\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"Why, how now, Ajax! wherefore do you thus? How now,\n"+
		"Thersites! what's the matter, man?\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"You see him there, do you?\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"Ay; what's the matter?\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"Nay, look upon him.\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"So I do: what's the matter?\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"Nay, but regard him well.\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"'Well!' why, I do so.\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"But yet you look not well upon him; for whosoever you\n"+
		"take him to be, he is Ajax.\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"I know that, fool.\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"Ay, but that fool knows not himself.\n"+
		"AJAX\n"+
		"Therefore I beat thee.\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"Lo, lo, lo, lo, what modicums of wit he utters! his\n"+
		"evasions have ears thus long. I have bobbed his\n"+
		"brain more than he has beat my bones: I will buy\n"+
		"nine sparrows for a penny, and his pia mater is not\n"+
		"worth the nineth part of a sparrow. This lord,\n"+
		"Achilles, Ajax, who wears his wit in his belly and\n"+
		"his guts in his head, I'll tell you what I say of\n"+
		"him.\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"What?\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"I say, this Ajax--\n"+
		"Ajax offers to beat him\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"Nay, good Ajax.\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"Has not so much wit--\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"Nay, I must hold you.\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"As will stop the eye of Helen's needle, for whom he\n"+
		"comes to fight.\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"Peace, fool!\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"I would have peace and quietness, but the fool will\n"+
		"not: he there: that he: look you there.\n"+
		"AJAX\n"+
		"O thou damned cur! I shall--\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"Will you set your wit to a fool's?\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"No, I warrant you; for a fools will shame it.\n"+
		"PATROCLUS\n"+
		"Good words, Thersites.\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"What's the quarrel?\n"+
		"AJAX\n"+
		"I bade the vile owl go learn me the tenor of the\n"+
		"proclamation, and he rails upon me.\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"I serve thee not.\n"+
		"AJAX\n"+
		"Well, go to, go to.\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"I serve here voluntarily.\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"Your last service was sufferance, 'twas not\n"+
		"voluntary: no man is beaten voluntary: Ajax was\n"+
		"here the voluntary, and you as under an impress.\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"E'en so; a great deal of your wit, too, lies in your\n"+
		"sinews, or else there be liars. Hector have a great\n"+
		"catch, if he knock out either of your brains: a'\n"+
		"were as good crack a fusty nut with no kernel.\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"What, with me too, Thersites?\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"There's Ulysses and old Nestor, whose wit was mouldy\n"+
		"ere your grandsires had nails on their toes, yoke you\n"+
		"like draught-oxen and make you plough up the wars.\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"What, what?\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"Yes, good sooth: to, Achilles! to, Ajax! to!\n"+
		"AJAX\n"+
		"I shall cut out your tongue.\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"'Tis no matter! I shall speak as much as thou\n"+
		"afterwards.\n"+
		"PATROCLUS\n"+
		"No more words, Thersites; peace!\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"I will hold my peace when Achilles' brach bids me, shall I?\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"There's for you, Patroclus.\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"I will see you hanged, like clotpoles, ere I come\n"+
		"any more to your tents: I will keep where there is\n"+
		"wit stirring and leave the faction of fools.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"PATROCLUS\n"+
		"A good riddance.\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"Marry, this, sir, is proclaim'd through all our host:\n"+
		"That Hector, by the fifth hour of the sun,\n"+
		"Will with a trumpet 'twixt our tents and Troy\n"+
		"To-morrow morning call some knight to arms\n"+
		"That hath a stomach; and such a one that dare\n"+
		"Maintain--I know not what: 'tis trash. Farewell.\n"+
		"AJAX\n"+
		"Farewell. Who shall answer him?\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"I know not: 'tis put to lottery; otherwise\n"+
		"He knew his man.\n"+
		"AJAX\n"+
		"O, meaning you. I will go learn more of it.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. Troy. A room in Priam's palace.\n"+
		"Enter PRIAM, HECTOR, TROILUS, PARIS, and HELENUS\n"+
		"PRIAM\n"+
		"After so many hours, lives, speeches spent,\n"+
		"Thus once again says Nestor from the Greeks:\n"+
		"'Deliver Helen, and all damage else--\n"+
		"As honour, loss of time, travail, expense,\n"+
		"Wounds, friends, and what else dear that is consumed\n"+
		"In hot digestion of this cormorant war--\n"+
		"Shall be struck off.' Hector, what say you to't?\n"+
		"HECTOR\n"+
		"Though no man lesser fears the Greeks than I\n"+
		"As far as toucheth my particular,\n"+
		"Yet, dread Priam,\n"+
		"There is no lady of more softer bowels,\n"+
		"More spongy to suck in the sense of fear,\n"+
		"More ready to cry out 'Who knows what follows?'\n"+
		"Than Hector is: the wound of peace is surety,\n"+
		"Surety secure; but modest doubt is call'd\n"+
		"The beacon of the wise, the tent that searches\n"+
		"To the bottom of the worst. Let Helen go:\n"+
		"Since the first sword was drawn about this question,\n"+
		"Every tithe soul, 'mongst many thousand dismes,\n"+
		"Hath been as dear as Helen; I mean, of ours:\n"+
		"If we have lost so many tenths of ours,\n"+
		"To guard a thing not ours nor worth to us,\n"+
		"Had it our name, the value of one ten,\n"+
		"What merit's in that reason which denies\n"+
		"The yielding of her up?\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Fie, fie, my brother!\n"+
		"Weigh you the worth and honour of a king\n"+
		"So great as our dread father in a scale\n"+
		"Of common ounces? will you with counters sum\n"+
		"The past proportion of his infinite?\n"+
		"And buckle in a waist most fathomless\n"+
		"With spans and inches so diminutive\n"+
		"As fears and reasons? fie, for godly shame!\n"+
		"HELENUS\n"+
		"No marvel, though you bite so sharp at reasons,\n"+
		"You are so empty of them. Should not our father\n"+
		"Bear the great sway of his affairs with reasons,\n"+
		"Because your speech hath none that tells him so?\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"You are for dreams and slumbers, brother priest;\n"+
		"You fur your gloves with reason. Here are\n"+
		"your reasons:\n"+
		"You know an enemy intends you harm;\n"+
		"You know a sword employ'd is perilous,\n"+
		"And reason flies the object of all harm:\n"+
		"Who marvels then, when Helenus beholds\n"+
		"A Grecian and his sword, if he do set\n"+
		"The very wings of reason to his heels\n"+
		"And fly like chidden Mercury from Jove,\n"+
		"Or like a star disorb'd? Nay, if we talk of reason,\n"+
		"Let's shut our gates and sleep: manhood and honour\n"+
		"Should have hare-hearts, would they but fat\n"+
		"their thoughts\n"+
		"With this cramm'd reason: reason and respect\n"+
		"Make livers pale and lustihood deject.\n"+
		"HECTOR\n"+
		"Brother, she is not worth what she doth cost\n"+
		"The holding.\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"What is aught, but as 'tis valued?\n"+
		"HECTOR\n"+
		"But value dwells not in particular will;\n"+
		"It holds his estimate and dignity\n"+
		"As well wherein 'tis precious of itself\n"+
		"As in the prizer: 'tis mad idolatry\n"+
		"To make the service greater than the god\n"+
		"And the will dotes that is attributive\n"+
		"To what infectiously itself affects,\n"+
		"Without some image of the affected merit.\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"I take to-day a wife, and my election\n"+
		"Is led on in the conduct of my will;\n"+
		"My will enkindled by mine eyes and ears,\n"+
		"Two traded pilots 'twixt the dangerous shores\n"+
		"Of will and judgment: how may I avoid,\n"+
		"Although my will distaste what it elected,\n"+
		"The wife I chose? there can be no evasion\n"+
		"To blench from this and to stand firm by honour:\n"+
		"We turn not back the silks upon the merchant,\n"+
		"When we have soil'd them, nor the remainder viands\n"+
		"We do not throw in unrespective sieve,\n"+
		"Because we now are full. It was thought meet\n"+
		"Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks:\n"+
		"Your breath of full consent bellied his sails;\n"+
		"The seas and winds, old wranglers, took a truce\n"+
		"And did him service: he touch'd the ports desired,\n"+
		"And for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive,\n"+
		"He brought a Grecian queen, whose youth and freshness\n"+
		"Wrinkles Apollo's, and makes stale the morning.\n"+
		"Why keep we her? the Grecians keep our aunt:\n"+
		"Is she worth keeping? why, she is a pearl,\n"+
		"Whose price hath launch'd above a thousand ships,\n"+
		"And turn'd crown'd kings to merchants.\n"+
		"If you'll avouch 'twas wisdom Paris went--\n"+
		"As you must needs, for you all cried 'Go, go,'--\n"+
		"If you'll confess he brought home noble prize--\n"+
		"As you must needs, for you all clapp'd your hands\n"+
		"And cried 'Inestimable!'--why do you now\n"+
		"The issue of your proper wisdoms rate,\n"+
		"And do a deed that fortune never did,\n"+
		"Beggar the estimation which you prized\n"+
		"Richer than sea and land? O, theft most base,\n"+
		"That we have stol'n what we do fear to keep!\n"+
		"But, thieves, unworthy of a thing so stol'n,\n"+
		"That in their country did them that disgrace,\n"+
		"We fear to warrant in our native place!\n"+
		"CASSANDRA\n"+
		"[Within] Cry, Trojans, cry!\n"+
		"PRIAM\n"+
		"What noise? what shriek is this?\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"'Tis our mad sister, I do know her voice.\n"+
		"CASSANDRA\n"+
		"[Within] Cry, Trojans!\n"+
		"HECTOR\n"+
		"It is Cassandra.\n"+
		"Enter CASSANDRA, raving\n"+
		"CASSANDRA\n"+
		"Cry, Trojans, cry! lend me ten thousand eyes,\n"+
		"And I will fill them with prophetic tears.\n"+
		"HECTOR\n"+
		"Peace, sister, peace!\n"+
		"CASSANDRA\n"+
		"Virgins and boys, mid-age and wrinkled eld,\n"+
		"Soft infancy, that nothing canst but cry,\n"+
		"Add to my clamours! let us pay betimes\n"+
		"A moiety of that mass of moan to come.\n"+
		"Cry, Trojans, cry! practise your eyes with tears!\n"+
		"Troy must not be, nor goodly Ilion stand;\n"+
		"Our firebrand brother, Paris, burns us all.\n"+
		"Cry, Trojans, cry! a Helen and a woe:\n"+
		"Cry, cry! Troy burns, or else let Helen go.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"HECTOR\n"+
		"Now, youthful Troilus, do not these high strains\n"+
		"Of divination in our sister work\n"+
		"Some touches of remorse? or is your blood\n"+
		"So madly hot that no discourse of reason,\n"+
		"Nor fear of bad success in a bad cause,\n"+
		"Can qualify the same?\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Why, brother Hector,\n"+
		"We may not think the justness of each act\n"+
		"Such and no other than event doth form it,\n"+
		"Nor once deject the courage of our minds,\n"+
		"Because Cassandra's mad: her brain-sick raptures\n"+
		"Cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel\n"+
		"Which hath our several honours all engaged\n"+
		"To make it gracious. For my private part,\n"+
		"I am no more touch'd than all Priam's sons:\n"+
		"And Jove forbid there should be done amongst us\n"+
		"Such things as might offend the weakest spleen\n"+
		"To fight for and maintain!\n"+
		"PARIS\n"+
		"Else might the world convince of levity\n"+
		"As well my undertakings as your counsels:\n"+
		"But I attest the gods, your full consent\n"+
		"Gave wings to my propension and cut off\n"+
		"All fears attending on so dire a project.\n"+
		"For what, alas, can these my single arms?\n"+
		"What Propugnation is in one man's valour,\n"+
		"To stand the push and enmity of those\n"+
		"This quarrel would excite? Yet, I protest,\n"+
		"Were I alone to pass the difficulties\n"+
		"And had as ample power as I have will,\n"+
		"Paris should ne'er retract what he hath done,\n"+
		"Nor faint in the pursuit.\n"+
		"PRIAM\n"+
		"Paris, you speak\n"+
		"Like one besotted on your sweet delights:\n"+
		"You have the honey still, but these the gall;\n"+
		"So to be valiant is no praise at all.\n"+
		"PARIS\n"+
		"Sir, I propose not merely to myself\n"+
		"The pleasures such a beauty brings with it;\n"+
		"But I would have the soil of her fair rape\n"+
		"Wiped off, in honourable keeping her.\n"+
		"What treason were it to the ransack'd queen,\n"+
		"Disgrace to your great worths and shame to me,\n"+
		"Now to deliver her possession up\n"+
		"On terms of base compulsion! Can it be\n"+
		"That so degenerate a strain as this\n"+
		"Should once set footing in your generous bosoms?\n"+
		"There's not the meanest spirit on our party\n"+
		"Without a heart to dare or sword to draw\n"+
		"When Helen is defended, nor none so noble\n"+
		"Whose life were ill bestow'd or death unfamed\n"+
		"Where Helen is the subject; then, I say,\n"+
		"Well may we fight for her whom, we know well,\n"+
		"The world's large spaces cannot parallel.\n"+
		"HECTOR\n"+
		"Paris and Troilus, you have both said well,\n"+
		"And on the cause and question now in hand\n"+
		"Have glozed, but superficially: not much\n"+
		"Unlike young men, whom Aristotle thought\n"+
		"Unfit to hear moral philosophy:\n"+
		"The reasons you allege do more conduce\n"+
		"To the hot passion of distemper'd blood\n"+
		"Than to make up a free determination\n"+
		"'Twixt right and wrong, for pleasure and revenge\n"+
		"Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice\n"+
		"Of any true decision. Nature craves\n"+
		"All dues be render'd to their owners: now,\n"+
		"What nearer debt in all humanity\n"+
		"Than wife is to the husband? If this law\n"+
		"Of nature be corrupted through affection,\n"+
		"And that great minds, of partial indulgence\n"+
		"To their benumbed wills, resist the same,\n"+
		"There is a law in each well-order'd nation\n"+
		"To curb those raging appetites that are\n"+
		"Most disobedient and refractory.\n"+
		"If Helen then be wife to Sparta's king,\n"+
		"As it is known she is, these moral laws\n"+
		"Of nature and of nations speak aloud\n"+
		"To have her back return'd: thus to persist\n"+
		"In doing wrong extenuates not wrong,\n"+
		"But makes it much more heavy. Hector's opinion\n"+
		"Is this in way of truth; yet ne'ertheless,\n"+
		"My spritely brethren, I propend to you\n"+
		"In resolution to keep Helen still,\n"+
		"For 'tis a cause that hath no mean dependance\n"+
		"Upon our joint and several dignities.\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Why, there you touch'd the life of our design:\n"+
		"Were it not glory that we more affected\n"+
		"Than the performance of our heaving spleens,\n"+
		"I would not wish a drop of Trojan blood\n"+
		"Spent more in her defence. But, worthy Hector,\n"+
		"She is a theme of honour and renown,\n"+
		"A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds,\n"+
		"Whose present courage may beat down our foes,\n"+
		"And fame in time to come canonize us;\n"+
		"For, I presume, brave Hector would not lose\n"+
		"So rich advantage of a promised glory\n"+
		"As smiles upon the forehead of this action\n"+
		"For the wide world's revenue.\n"+
		"HECTOR\n"+
		"I am yours,\n"+
		"You valiant offspring of great Priamus.\n"+
		"I have a roisting challenge sent amongst\n"+
		"The dun and factious nobles of the Greeks\n"+
		"Will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits:\n"+
		"I was advertised their great general slept,\n"+
		"Whilst emulation in the army crept:\n"+
		"This, I presume, will wake him.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. The Grecian camp. Before Achilles' tent.\n"+
		"Enter THERSITES, solus\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"How now, Thersites! what lost in the labyrinth of\n"+
		"thy fury! Shall the elephant Ajax carry it thus? He\n"+
		"beats me, and I rail at him: O, worthy satisfaction!\n"+
		"would it were otherwise; that I could beat him,\n"+
		"whilst he railed at me. 'Sfoot, I'll learn to\n"+
		"conjure and raise devils, but I'll see some issue of\n"+
		"my spiteful execrations. Then there's Achilles, a\n"+
		"rare enginer! If Troy be not taken till these two\n"+
		"undermine it, the walls will stand till they fall of\n"+
		"themselves. O thou great thunder-darter of Olympus,\n"+
		"forget that thou art Jove, the king of gods and,\n"+
		"Mercury, lose all the serpentine craft of thy\n"+
		"caduceus, if ye take not that little, little less\n"+
		"than little wit from them that they have! which\n"+
		"short-armed ignorance itself knows is so abundant\n"+
		"scarce, it will not in circumvention deliver a fly\n"+
		"from a spider, without drawing their massy irons and\n"+
		"cutting the web. After this, the vengeance on the\n"+
		"whole camp! or rather, the bone-ache! for that,\n"+
		"methinks, is the curse dependent on those that war\n"+
		"for a placket. I have said my prayers and devil Envy\n"+
		"say Amen. What ho! my Lord Achilles!\n"+
		"Enter PATROCLUS\n"+
		"PATROCLUS\n"+
		"Who's there? Thersites! Good Thersites, come in and rail.\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"If I could have remembered a gilt counterfeit, thou\n"+
		"wouldst not have slipped out of my contemplation: but\n"+
		"it is no matter; thyself upon thyself! The common\n"+
		"curse of mankind, folly and ignorance, be thine in\n"+
		"great revenue! heaven bless thee from a tutor, and\n"+
		"discipline come not near thee! Let thy blood be thy\n"+
		"direction till thy death! then if she that lays thee\n"+
		"out says thou art a fair corse, I'll be sworn and\n"+
		"sworn upon't she never shrouded any but lazars.\n"+
		"Amen. Where's Achilles?\n"+
		"PATROCLUS\n"+
		"What, art thou devout? wast thou in prayer?\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"Ay: the heavens hear me!\n"+
		"Enter ACHILLES\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"Who's there?\n"+
		"PATROCLUS\n"+
		"Thersites, my lord.\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"Where, where? Art thou come? why, my cheese, my\n"+
		"digestion, why hast thou not served thyself in to\n"+
		"my table so many meals? Come, what's Agamemnon?\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"Thy commander, Achilles. Then tell me, Patroclus,\n"+
		"what's Achilles?\n"+
		"PATROCLUS\n"+
		"Thy lord, Thersites: then tell me, I pray thee,\n"+
		"what's thyself?\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"Thy knower, Patroclus: then tell me, Patroclus,\n"+
		"what art thou?\n"+
		"PATROCLUS\n"+
		"Thou mayst tell that knowest.\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"O, tell, tell.\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"I'll decline the whole question. Agamemnon commands\n"+
		"Achilles; Achilles is my lord; I am Patroclus'\n"+
		"knower, and Patroclus is a fool.\n"+
		"PATROCLUS\n"+
		"You rascal!\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"Peace, fool! I have not done.\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"He is a privileged man. Proceed, Thersites.\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"Agamemnon is a fool; Achilles is a fool; Thersites\n"+
		"is a fool, and, as aforesaid, Patroclus is a fool.\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"Derive this; come.\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"Agamemnon is a fool to offer to command Achilles;\n"+
		"Achilles is a fool to be commanded of Agamemnon;\n"+
		"Thersites is a fool to serve such a fool, and\n"+
		"Patroclus is a fool positive.\n"+
		"PATROCLUS\n"+
		"Why am I a fool?\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"Make that demand of the prover. It suffices me thou\n"+

		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"Patroclus, I'll speak with nobody.\n"+
		"Come in with me, Thersites.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"Here is such patchery, such juggling and such\n"+
		"knavery! all the argument is a cuckold and a\n"+
		"whore; a good quarrel to draw emulous factions\n"+
		"and bleed to death upon. Now, the dry serpigo on\n"+
		"the subject! and war and lechery confound all!\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"Enter AGAMEMNON, ULYSSES, NESTOR, DIOMEDES, and AJAX\n"+
		"AGAMEMNON\n"+
		"Where is Achilles?\n"+
		"PATROCLUS\n"+
		"Within his tent; but ill disposed, my lord.\n"+
		"AGAMEMNON\n"+
		"Let it be known to him that we are here.\n"+
		"He shent our messengers; and we lay by\n"+
		"Our appertainments, visiting of him:\n"+
		"Let him be told so; lest perchance he think\n"+
		"We dare not move the question of our place,\n"+
		"Or know not what we are.\n"+
		"PATROCLUS\n"+
		"I shall say so to him.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"We saw him at the opening of his tent:\n"+
		"He is not sick.\n"+
		"AJAX\n"+
		"Yes, lion-sick, sick of proud heart: you may call it\n"+
		"melancholy, if you will favour the man; but, by my\n"+
		"head, 'tis pride: but why, why? let him show us the\n"+
		"cause. A word, my lord.\n"+
		"Takes AGAMEMNON aside\n"+
		"NESTOR\n"+
		"What moves Ajax thus to bay at him?\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"Achilles hath inveigled his fool from him.\n"+
		"NESTOR\n"+
		"Who, Thersites?\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"He.\n"+
		"NESTOR\n"+
		"Then will Ajax lack matter, if he have lost his argument.\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"No, you see, he is his argument that has his\n"+
		"argument, Achilles.\n"+
		"NESTOR\n"+
		"All the better; their fraction is more our wish than\n"+
		"their faction: but it was a strong composure a fool\n"+
		"could disunite.\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"The amity that wisdom knits not, folly may easily\n"+
		"untie. Here comes Patroclus.\n"+
		"Re-enter PATROCLUS\n"+
		"NESTOR\n"+
		"No Achilles with him.\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"The elephant hath joints, but none for courtesy:\n"+
		"his legs are legs for necessity, not for flexure.\n"+
		"PATROCLUS\n"+
		"Achilles bids me say, he is much sorry,\n"+
		"If any thing more than your sport and pleasure\n"+
		"Did move your greatness and this noble state\n"+
		"To call upon him; he hopes it is no other\n"+
		"But for your health and your digestion sake,\n"+
		"And after-dinner's breath.\n"+
		"AGAMEMNON\n"+
		"Hear you, Patroclus:\n"+
		"We are too well acquainted with these answers:\n"+
		"But his evasion, wing'd thus swift with scorn,\n"+
		"Cannot outfly our apprehensions.\n"+
		"Much attribute he hath, and much the reason\n"+
		"Why we ascribe it to him; yet all his virtues,\n"+
		"Not virtuously on his own part beheld,\n"+
		"Do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss,\n"+
		"Yea, like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish,\n"+
		"Are like to rot untasted. Go and tell him,\n"+
		"We come to speak with him; and you shall not sin,\n"+
		"If you do say we think him over-proud\n"+
		"And under-honest, in self-assumption greater\n"+
		"Than in the note of judgment; and worthier\n"+
		"than himself\n"+
		"Here tend the savage strangeness he puts on,\n"+
		"Disguise the holy strength of their command,\n"+
		"And underwrite in an observing kind\n"+
		"His humorous predominance; yea, watch\n"+
		"His pettish lunes, his ebbs, his flows, as if\n"+
		"The passage and whole carriage of this action\n"+
		"Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,\n"+
		"That if he overhold his price so much,\n"+
		"We'll none of him; but let him, like an engine\n"+
		"Not portable, lie under this report:\n"+
		"'Bring action hither, this cannot go to war:\n"+
		"A stirring dwarf we do allowance give\n"+
		"Before a sleeping giant.' Tell him so.\n"+
		"PATROCLUS\n"+
		"I shall; and bring his answer presently.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"AGAMEMNON\n"+
		"In second voice we'll not be satisfied;\n"+
		"We come to speak with him. Ulysses, enter you.\n"+
		"Exit ULYSSES\n"+
		"AJAX\n"+
		"What is he more than another?\n"+
		"AGAMEMNON\n"+
		"No more than what he thinks he is.\n"+
		"AJAX\n"+
		"Is he so much? Do you not think he thinks himself a\n"+
		"better man than I am?\n"+
		"AGAMEMNON\n"+
		"No question.\n"+
		"AJAX\n"+
		"Will you subscribe his thought, and say he is?\n"+
		"AGAMEMNON\n"+
		"No, noble Ajax; you are as strong, as valiant, as\n"+
		"wise, no less noble, much more gentle, and altogether\n"+
		"more tractable.\n"+
		"AJAX\n"+
		"Why should a man be proud? How doth pride grow? I\n"+
		"know not what pride is.\n"+
		"AGAMEMNON\n"+
		"Your mind is the clearer, Ajax, and your virtues the\n"+
		"fairer. He that is proud eats up himself: pride is\n"+
		"his own glass, his own trumpet, his own chronicle;\n"+
		"and whatever praises itself but in the deed, devours\n"+
		"the deed in the praise.\n"+
		"AJAX\n"+
		"I do hate a proud man, as I hate the engendering of toads.\n"+
		"NESTOR\n"+
		"Yet he loves himself: is't not strange?\n"+
		"Aside\n"+
		"Re-enter ULYSSES\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"Achilles will not to the field to-morrow.\n"+
		"AGAMEMNON\n"+
		"What's his excuse?\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"He doth rely on none,\n"+
		"But carries on the stream of his dispose\n"+
		"Without observance or respect of any,\n"+
		"In will peculiar and in self-admission.\n"+
		"AGAMEMNON\n"+
		"Why will he not upon our fair request\n"+
		"Untent his person and share the air with us?\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"Things small as nothing, for request's sake only,\n"+
		"He makes important: possess'd he is with greatness,\n"+
		"And speaks not to himself but with a pride\n"+
		"That quarrels at self-breath: imagined worth\n"+
		"Holds in his blood such swoln and hot discourse\n"+
		"That 'twixt his mental and his active parts\n"+
		"Kingdom'd Achilles in commotion rages\n"+
		"And batters down himself: what should I say?\n"+
		"He is so plaguy proud that the death-tokens of it\n"+
		"Cry 'No recovery.'\n"+
		"AGAMEMNON\n"+
		"Let Ajax go to him.\n"+
		"Dear lord, go you and greet him in his tent:\n"+
		"'Tis said he holds you well, and will be led\n"+
		"At your request a little from himself.\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"O Agamemnon, let it not be so!\n"+
		"We'll consecrate the steps that Ajax makes\n"+
		"When they go from Achilles: shall the proud lord\n"+
		"That bastes his arrogance with his own seam\n"+
		"And never suffers matter of the world\n"+
		"Enter his thoughts, save such as do revolve\n"+
		"And ruminate himself, shall he be worshipp'd\n"+
		"Of that we hold an idol more than he?\n"+
		"No, this thrice worthy and right valiant lord\n"+
		"Must not so stale his palm, nobly acquired;\n"+
		"Nor, by my will, assubjugate his merit,\n"+
		"As amply titled as Achilles is,\n"+
		"By going to Achilles:\n"+
		"That were to enlard his fat already pride\n"+
		"And add more coals to Cancer when he burns\n"+
		"With entertaining great Hyperion.\n"+
		"This lord go to him! Jupiter forbid,\n"+
		"And say in thunder 'Achilles go to him.'\n"+
		"NESTOR\n"+
		"[Aside to DIOMEDES] O, this is well; he rubs the\n"+
		"vein of him.\n"+
		"DIOMEDES\n"+
		"[Aside to NESTOR] And how his silence drinks up\n"+
		"this applause!\n"+
		"AJAX\n"+
		"If I go to him, with my armed fist I'll pash him o'er the face.\n"+
		"AGAMEMNON\n"+
		"O, no, you shall not go.\n"+
		"AJAX\n"+
		"An a' be proud with me, I'll pheeze his pride:\n"+
		"Let me go to him.\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"Not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel.\n"+
		"AJAX\n"+
		"A paltry, insolent fellow!\n"+
		"NESTOR\n"+
		"How he describes himself!\n"+
		"AJAX\n"+
		"Can he not be sociable?\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"The raven chides blackness.\n"+
		"AJAX\n"+
		"I'll let his humours blood.\n"+
		"AGAMEMNON\n"+
		"He will be the physician that should be the patient.\n"+
		"AJAX\n"+
		"An all men were o' my mind,--\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"Wit would be out of fashion.\n"+
		"AJAX\n"+
		"A' should not bear it so, a' should eat swords first:\n"+
		"shall pride carry it?\n"+
		"NESTOR\n"+
		"An 'twould, you'ld carry half.\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"A' would have ten shares.\n"+
		"AJAX\n"+
		"I will knead him; I'll make him supple.\n"+
		"NESTOR\n"+
		"He's not yet through warm: force him with praises:\n"+
		"pour in, pour in; his ambition is dry.\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"[To AGAMEMNON] My lord, you feed too much on this dislike.\n"+
		"NESTOR\n"+
		"Our noble general, do not do so.\n"+
		"DIOMEDES\n"+
		"You must prepare to fight without Achilles.\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"Why, 'tis this naming of him does him harm.\n"+
		"Here is a man--but 'tis before his face;\n"+
		"I will be silent.\n"+
		"NESTOR\n"+
		"Wherefore should you so?\n"+
		"He is not emulous, as Achilles is.\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"Know the whole world, he is as valiant.\n"+
		"AJAX\n"+
		"A whoreson dog, that shall pelter thus with us!\n"+
		"Would he were a Trojan!\n"+
		"NESTOR\n"+
		"What a vice were it in Ajax now,--\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"If he were proud,--\n"+
		"DIOMEDES\n"+
		"Or covetous of praise,--\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"Ay, or surly borne,--\n"+
		"DIOMEDES\n"+
		"Or strange, or self-affected!\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"Thank the heavens, lord, thou art of sweet composure;\n"+
		"Praise him that got thee, she that gave thee suck:\n"+
		"Famed be thy tutor, and thy parts of nature\n"+
		"Thrice famed, beyond all erudition:\n"+
		"But he that disciplined thy arms to fight,\n"+
		"Let Mars divide eternity in twain,\n"+
		"And give him half: and, for thy vigour,\n"+
		"Bull-bearing Milo his addition yield\n"+
		"To sinewy Ajax. I will not praise thy wisdom,\n"+
		"Which, like a bourn, a pale, a shore, confines\n"+
		"Thy spacious and dilated parts: here's Nestor;\n"+
		"Instructed by the antiquary times,\n"+
		"He must, he is, he cannot but be wise:\n"+
		"Put pardon, father Nestor, were your days\n"+
		"As green as Ajax' and your brain so temper'd,\n"+
		"You should not have the eminence of him,\n"+
		"But be as Ajax.\n"+
		"AJAX\n"+
		"Shall I call you father?\n"+
		"NESTOR\n"+
		"Ay, my good son.\n"+
		"DIOMEDES\n"+
		"Be ruled by him, Lord Ajax.\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"There is no tarrying here; the hart Achilles\n"+
		"Keeps thicket. Please it our great general\n"+
		"To call together all his state of war;\n"+
		"Fresh kings are come to Troy: to-morrow\n"+
		"We must with all our main of power stand fast:\n"+
		"And here's a lord,--come knights from east to west,\n"+
		"And cull their flower, Ajax shall cope the best.\n"+
		"AGAMEMNON\n"+
		"Go we to council. Let Achilles sleep:\n"+
		"Light boats sail swift, though greater hulks draw deep.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT III\n"+
		"SCENE I. Troy. Priam's palace.\n"+
		"Enter a Servant and PANDARUS\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Friend, you! pray you, a word: do not you follow\n"+
		"the young Lord Paris?\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"Ay, sir, when he goes before me.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"You depend upon him, I mean?\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"Sir, I do depend upon the lord.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"You depend upon a noble gentleman; I must needs\n"+
		"praise him.\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"The lord be praised!\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"You know me, do you not?\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"Faith, sir, superficially.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Friend, know me better; I am the Lord Pandarus.\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"I hope I shall know your honour better.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"I do desire it.\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"You are in the state of grace.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Grace! not so, friend: honour and lordship are my titles.\n"+
		"Music within\n"+
		"What music is this?\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"I do but partly know, sir: it is music in parts.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Know you the musicians?\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"Wholly, sir.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Who play they to?\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"To the hearers, sir.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"At whose pleasure, friend\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"At mine, sir, and theirs that love music.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Command, I mean, friend.\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"Who shall I command, sir?\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Friend, we understand not one another: I am too\n"+
		"courtly and thou art too cunning. At whose request\n"+
		"do these men play?\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"That's to 't indeed, sir: marry, sir, at the request\n"+
		"of Paris my lord, who's there in person; with him,\n"+
		"the mortal Venus, the heart-blood of beauty, love's\n"+
		"invisible soul,--\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Who, my cousin Cressida?\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"No, sir, Helen: could you not find out that by her\n"+
		"attributes?\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"It should seem, fellow, that thou hast not seen the\n"+
		"Lady Cressida. I come to speak with Paris from the\n"+
		"Prince Troilus: I will make a complimental assault\n"+
		"upon him, for my business seethes.\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"Sodden business! there's a stewed phrase indeed!\n"+
		"Enter PARIS and HELEN, attended\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Fair be to you, my lord, and to all this fair\n"+
		"company! fair desires, in all fair measure,\n"+
		"fairly guide them! especially to you, fair queen!\n"+
		"fair thoughts be your fair pillow!\n"+
		"HELEN\n"+
		"Dear lord, you are full of fair words.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"You speak your fair pleasure, sweet queen. Fair\n"+
		"prince, here is good broken music.\n"+
		"PARIS\n"+
		"You have broke it, cousin: and, by my life, you\n"+
		"shall make it whole again; you shall piece it out\n"+
		"with a piece of your performance. Nell, he is full\n"+
		"of harmony.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Truly, lady, no.\n"+
		"HELEN\n"+
		"O, sir,--\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Rude, in sooth; in good sooth, very rude.\n"+
		"PARIS\n"+
		"Well said, my lord! well, you say so in fits.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"I have business to my lord, dear queen. My lord,\n"+
		"will you vouchsafe me a word?\n"+
		"HELEN\n"+
		"Nay, this shall not hedge us out: we'll hear you\n"+
		"sing, certainly.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Well, sweet queen. you are pleasant with me. But,\n"+
		"marry, thus, my lord: my dear lord and most esteemed\n"+
		"friend, your brother Troilus,--\n"+
		"HELEN\n"+
		"My Lord Pandarus; honey-sweet lord,--\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Go to, sweet queen, to go:--commends himself most\n"+
		"affectionately to you,--\n"+
		"HELEN\n"+
		"You shall not bob us out of our melody: if you do,\n"+
		"our melancholy upon your head!\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Sweet queen, sweet queen! that's a sweet queen, i' faith.\n"+
		"HELEN\n"+
		"And to make a sweet lady sad is a sour offence.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Nay, that shall not serve your turn; that shall not,\n"+
		"in truth, la. Nay, I care not for such words; no,\n"+
		"no. And, my lord, he desires you, that if the king\n"+
		"call for him at supper, you will make his excuse.\n"+
		"HELEN\n"+
		"My Lord Pandarus,--\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"What says my sweet queen, my very very sweet queen?\n"+
		"PARIS\n"+
		"What exploit's in hand? where sups he to-night?\n"+
		"HELEN\n"+
		"Nay, but, my lord,--\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"What says my sweet queen? My cousin will fall out\n"+
		"with you. You must not know where he sups.\n"+
		"PARIS\n"+
		"I'll lay my life, with my disposer Cressida.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"No, no, no such matter; you are wide: come, your\n"+
		"disposer is sick.\n"+
		"PARIS\n"+
		"Well, I'll make excuse.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Ay, good my lord. Why should you say Cressida? no,\n"+
		"your poor disposer's sick.\n"+
		"PARIS\n"+
		"I spy.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"You spy! what do you spy? Come, give me an\n"+
		"instrument. Now, sweet queen.\n"+
		"HELEN\n"+
		"Why, this is kindly done.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"My niece is horribly in love with a thing you have,\n"+
		"sweet queen.\n"+
		"HELEN\n"+
		"She shall have it, my lord, if it be not my lord Paris.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"He! no, she'll none of him; they two are twain.\n"+
		"HELEN\n"+
		"Falling in, after falling out, may make them three.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Come, come, I'll hear no more of this; I'll sing\n"+
		"you a song now.\n"+
		"HELEN\n"+
		"Ay, ay, prithee now. By my troth, sweet lord, thou\n"+
		"hast a fine forehead.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Ay, you may, you may.\n"+
		"HELEN\n"+
		"Let thy song be love: this love will undo us all.\n"+
		"O Cupid, Cupid, Cupid!\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Love! ay, that it shall, i' faith.\n"+
		"PARIS\n"+
		"Ay, good now, love, love, nothing but love.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"In good troth, it begins so.\n"+
		"Sings\n"+
		"Love, love, nothing but love, still more!\n"+
		"For, O, love's bow\n"+
		"Shoots buck and doe:\n"+
		"The shaft confounds,\n"+
		"Not that it wounds,\n"+
		"But tickles still the sore.\n"+
		"These lovers cry Oh! oh! they die!\n"+
		"Yet that which seems the wound to kill,\n"+
		"Doth turn oh! oh! to ha! ha! he!\n"+
		"So dying love lives still:\n"+
		"Oh! oh! a while, but ha! ha! ha!\n"+
		"Oh! oh! groans out for ha! ha! ha!\n"+
		"Heigh-ho!\n"+
		"HELEN\n"+
		"In love, i' faith, to the very tip of the nose.\n"+
		"PARIS\n"+
		"He eats nothing but doves, love, and that breeds hot\n"+
		"blood, and hot blood begets hot thoughts, and hot\n"+
		"thoughts beget hot deeds, and hot deeds is love.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Is this the generation of love? hot blood, hot\n"+
		"thoughts, and hot deeds? Why, they are vipers:\n"+
		"is love a generation of vipers? Sweet lord, who's\n"+
		"a-field to-day?\n"+
		"PARIS\n"+
		"Hector, Deiphobus, Helenus, Antenor, and all the\n"+
		"gallantry of Troy: I would fain have armed to-day,\n"+
		"but my Nell would not have it so. How chance my\n"+
		"brother Troilus went not?\n"+
		"HELEN\n"+
		"He hangs the lip at something: you know all, Lord Pandarus.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Not I, honey-sweet queen. I long to hear how they\n"+
		"sped to-day. You'll remember your brother's excuse?\n"+
		"PARIS\n"+
		"To a hair.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Farewell, sweet queen.\n"+
		"HELEN\n"+
		"Commend me to your niece.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"I will, sweet queen.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"A retreat sounded\n"+
		"PARIS\n"+
		"They're come from field: let us to Priam's hall,\n"+
		"To greet the warriors. Sweet Helen, I must woo you\n"+
		"To help unarm our Hector: his stubborn buckles,\n"+
		"With these your white enchanting fingers touch'd,\n"+
		"Shall more obey than to the edge of steel\n"+
		"Or force of Greekish sinews; you shall do more\n"+
		"Than all the island kings,--disarm great Hector.\n"+
		"HELEN\n"+
		"'Twill make us proud to be his servant, Paris;\n"+
		"Yea, what he shall receive of us in duty\n"+
		"Gives us more palm in beauty than we have,\n"+
		"Yea, overshines ourself.\n"+
		"PARIS\n"+
		"Sweet, above thought I love thee.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. The same. Pandarus' orchard.\n"+
		"Enter PANDARUS and Troilus's Boy, meeting\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"How now! where's thy master? at my cousin\n"+
		"Cressida's?\n"+
		"Boy\n"+
		"No, sir; he stays for you to conduct him thither.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"O, here he comes.\n"+
		"Enter TROILUS\n"+
		"How now, how now!\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Sirrah, walk off.\n"+
		"Exit Boy\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Have you seen my cousin?\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"No, Pandarus: I stalk about her door,\n"+
		"Like a strange soul upon the Stygian banks\n"+
		"Staying for waftage. O, be thou my Charon,\n"+
		"And give me swift transportance to those fields\n"+
		"Where I may wallow in the lily-beds\n"+
		"Proposed for the deserver! O gentle Pandarus,\n"+
		"From Cupid's shoulder pluck his painted wings\n"+
		"And fly with me to Cressid!\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Walk here i' the orchard, I'll bring her straight.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"I am giddy; expectation whirls me round.\n"+
		"The imaginary relish is so sweet\n"+
		"That it enchants my sense: what will it be,\n"+
		"When that the watery palate tastes indeed\n"+
		"Love's thrice repured nectar? death, I fear me,\n"+
		"Swooning destruction, or some joy too fine,\n"+
		"Too subtle-potent, tuned too sharp in sweetness,\n"+
		"For the capacity of my ruder powers:\n"+
		"I fear it much; and I do fear besides,\n"+
		"That I shall lose distinction in my joys;\n"+
		"As doth a battle, when they charge on heaps\n"+
		"The enemy flying.\n"+
		"Re-enter PANDARUS\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"She's making her ready, she'll come straight: you\n"+
		"must be witty now. She does so blush, and fetches\n"+
		"her wind so short, as if she were frayed with a\n"+
		"sprite: I'll fetch her. It is the prettiest\n"+
		"villain: she fetches her breath as short as a\n"+
		"new-ta'en sparrow.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Even such a passion doth embrace my bosom:\n"+
		"My heart beats thicker than a feverous pulse;\n"+
		"And all my powers do their bestowing lose,\n"+

		"Come, come, what need you blush? shame's a baby.\n"+
		"Here she is now: swear the oaths now to her that\n"+
		"you have sworn to me. What, are you gone again?\n"+
		"you must be watched ere you be made tame, must you?\n"+
		"Come your ways, come your ways; an you draw backward,\n"+
		"we'll put you i' the fills. Why do you not speak to\n"+
		"her? Come, draw this curtain, and let's see your\n"+
		"picture. Alas the day, how loath you are to offend\n"+
		"daylight! an 'twere dark, you'ld close sooner.\n"+
		"So, so; rub on, and kiss the mistress. How now!\n"+
		"a kiss in fee-farm! build there, carpenter; the air\n"+
		"is sweet. Nay, you shall fight your hearts out ere\n"+
		"I part you. The falcon as the tercel, for all the\n"+
		"ducks i' the river: go to, go to.\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"You have bereft me of all words, lady.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Words pay no debts, give her deeds: but she'll\n"+

		"'In witness whereof the parties interchangeably'--\n"+
		"Come in, come in: I'll go get a fire.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Will you walk in, my lord?\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"O Cressida, how often have I wished me thus!\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Wished, my lord! The gods grant,--O my lord!\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"What should they grant? what makes this pretty\n"+
		"abruption? What too curious dreg espies my sweet\n"+
		"lady in the fountain of our love?\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"More dregs than water, if my fears have eyes.\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Fears make devils of cherubims; they never see truly.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Blind fear, that seeing reason leads, finds safer\n"+
		"footing than blind reason stumbling without fear: to\n"+
		"fear the worst oft cures the worse.\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"O, let my lady apprehend no fear: in all Cupid's\n"+
		"pageant there is presented no monster.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Nor nothing monstrous neither?\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Nothing, but our undertakings; when we vow to weep\n"+
		"seas, live in fire, eat rocks, tame tigers; thinking\n"+
		"it harder for our mistress to devise imposition\n"+
		"enough than for us to undergo any difficulty imposed.\n"+
		"This is the monstruosity in love, lady, that the will\n"+
		"is infinite and the execution confined, that the\n"+
		"desire is boundless and the act a slave to limit.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"They say all lovers swear more performance than they\n"+
		"are able and yet reserve an ability that they never\n"+
		"perform, vowing more than the perfection of ten and\n"+
		"discharging less than the tenth part of one. They\n"+
		"that have the voice of lions and the act of hares,\n"+
		"are they not monsters?\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Are there such? such are not we: praise us as we\n"+
		"are tasted, allow us as we prove; our head shall go\n"+
		"bare till merit crown it: no perfection in reversion\n"+
		"shall have a praise in present: we will not name\n"+
		"desert before his birth, and, being born, his addition\n"+
		"shall be humble. Few words to fair faith: Troilus\n"+
		"shall be such to Cressid as what envy can say worst\n"+
		"shall be a mock for his truth, and what truth can\n"+
		"speak truest not truer than Troilus.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Will you walk in, my lord?\n"+
		"Re-enter PANDARUS\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"What, blushing still? have you not done talking yet?\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Well, uncle, what folly I commit, I dedicate to you.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"I thank you for that: if my lord get a boy of you,\n"+
		"you'll give him me. Be true to my lord: if he\n"+
		"flinch, chide me for it.\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"You know now your hostages; your uncle's word and my\n"+
		"firm faith.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Nay, I'll give my word for her too: our kindred,\n"+
		"though they be long ere they are wooed, they are\n"+
		"constant being won: they are burs, I can tell you;\n"+
		"they'll stick where they are thrown.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Boldness comes to me now, and brings me heart.\n"+
		"Prince Troilus, I have loved you night and day\n"+
		"For many weary months.\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Why was my Cressid then so hard to win?\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Hard to seem won: but I was won, my lord,\n"+
		"With the first glance that ever--pardon me--\n"+
		"If I confess much, you will play the tyrant.\n"+
		"I love you now; but not, till now, so much\n"+
		"But I might master it: in faith, I lie;\n"+
		"My thoughts were like unbridled children, grown\n"+
		"Too headstrong for their mother. See, we fools!\n"+
		"Why have I blabb'd? who shall be true to us,\n"+
		"When we are so unsecret to ourselves?\n"+
		"But, though I loved you well, I woo'd you not;\n"+
		"And yet, good faith, I wish'd myself a man,\n"+
		"Or that we women had men's privilege\n"+
		"Of speaking first. Sweet, bid me hold my tongue,\n"+
		"For in this rapture I shall surely speak\n"+
		"The thing I shall repent. See, see, your silence,\n"+
		"Cunning in dumbness, from my weakness draws\n"+
		"My very soul of counsel! stop my mouth.\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"And shall, albeit sweet music issues thence.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Pretty, i' faith.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"My lord, I do beseech you, pardon me;\n"+
		"'Twas not my purpose, thus to beg a kiss:\n"+
		"I am ashamed. O heavens! what have I done?\n"+
		"For this time will I take my leave, my lord.\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Your leave, sweet Cressid!\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Leave! an you take leave till to-morrow morning,--\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Pray you, content you.\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"What offends you, lady?\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Sir, mine own company.\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"You cannot shun Yourself.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Let me go and try:\n"+
		"I have a kind of self resides with you;\n"+
		"But an unkind self, that itself will leave,\n"+
		"To be another's fool. I would be gone:\n"+
		"Where is my wit? I know not what I speak.\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Well know they what they speak that speak so wisely.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Perchance, my lord, I show more craft than love;\n"+
		"And fell so roundly to a large confession,\n"+
		"To angle for your thoughts: but you are wise,\n"+
		"Or else you love not, for to be wise and love\n"+
		"Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"O that I thought it could be in a woman--\n"+
		"As, if it can, I will presume in you--\n"+
		"To feed for aye her ramp and flames of love;\n"+
		"To keep her constancy in plight and youth,\n"+
		"Outliving beauty's outward, with a mind\n"+
		"That doth renew swifter than blood decays!\n"+
		"Or that persuasion could but thus convince me,\n"+
		"That my integrity and truth to you\n"+
		"Might be affronted with the match and weight\n"+
		"Of such a winnow'd purity in love;\n"+
		"How were I then uplifted! but, alas!\n"+
		"I am as true as truth's simplicity\n"+
		"And simpler than the infancy of truth.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"In that I'll war with you.\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"O virtuous fight,\n"+
		"When right with right wars who shall be most right!\n"+
		"True swains in love shall in the world to come\n"+
		"Approve their truths by Troilus: when their rhymes,\n"+
		"Full of protest, of oath and big compare,\n"+
		"Want similes, truth tired with iteration,\n"+
		"As true as steel, as plantage to the moon,\n"+
		"As sun to day, as turtle to her mate,\n"+
		"As iron to adamant, as earth to the centre,\n"+
		"Yet, after all comparisons of truth,\n"+
		"As truth's authentic author to be cited,\n"+
		"'As true as Troilus' shall crown up the verse,\n"+
		"And sanctify the numbers.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Prophet may you be!\n"+
		"If I be false, or swerve a hair from truth,\n"+
		"When time is old and hath forgot itself,\n"+
		"When waterdrops have worn the stones of Troy,\n"+
		"And blind oblivion swallow'd cities up,\n"+
		"And mighty states characterless are grated\n"+
		"To dusty nothing, yet let memory,\n"+
		"From false to false, among false maids in love,\n"+
		"Upbraid my falsehood! when they've said 'as false\n"+
		"As air, as water, wind, or sandy earth,\n"+
		"As fox to lamb, as wolf to heifer's calf,\n"+
		"Pard to the hind, or stepdame to her son,'\n"+
		"'Yea,' let them say, to stick the heart of falsehood,\n"+
		"'As false as Cressid.'\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Go to, a bargain made: seal it, seal it; I'll be the\n"+
		"witness. Here I hold your hand, here my cousin's.\n"+
		"If ever you prove false one to another, since I have\n"+
		"taken such pains to bring you together, let all\n"+
		"pitiful goers-between be called to the world's end\n"+
		"after my name; call them all Pandars; let all\n"+
		"constant men be Troiluses, all false women Cressids,\n"+
		"and all brokers-between Pandars! say, amen.\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Amen.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Amen.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Amen. Whereupon I will show you a chamber with a\n"+
		"bed; which bed, because it shall not speak of your\n"+
		"pretty encounters, press it to death: away!\n"+
		"And Cupid grant all tongue-tied maidens here\n"+
		"Bed, chamber, Pandar to provide this gear!\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. The Grecian camp. Before Achilles' tent.\n"+
		"Enter AGAMEMNON, ULYSSES, DIOMEDES, NESTOR, AJAX, MENELAUS, and CALCHAS\n"+
		"CALCHAS\n"+
		"Now, princes, for the service I have done you,\n"+
		"The advantage of the time prompts me aloud\n"+
		"To call for recompense. Appear it to your mind\n"+
		"That, through the sight I bear in things to love,\n"+
		"I have abandon'd Troy, left my possession,\n"+
		"Incurr'd a traitor's name; exposed myself,\n"+
		"From certain and possess'd conveniences,\n"+
		"To doubtful fortunes; sequestering from me all\n"+
		"That time, acquaintance, custom and condition\n"+
		"Made tame and most familiar to my nature,\n"+
		"And here, to do you service, am become\n"+
		"As new into the world, strange, unacquainted:\n"+
		"I do beseech you, as in way of taste,\n"+
		"To give me now a little benefit,\n"+
		"Out of those many register'd in promise,\n"+
		"Which, you say, live to come in my behalf.\n"+
		"AGAMEMNON\n"+
		"What wouldst thou of us, Trojan? make demand.\n"+
		"CALCHAS\n"+
		"You have a Trojan prisoner, call'd Antenor,\n"+
		"Yesterday took: Troy holds him very dear.\n"+
		"Oft have you--often have you thanks therefore--\n"+
		"Desired my Cressid in right great exchange,\n"+
		"Whom Troy hath still denied: but this Antenor,\n"+
		"I know, is such a wrest in their affairs\n"+
		"That their negotiations all must slack,\n"+
		"Wanting his manage; and they will almost\n"+
		"Give us a prince of blood, a son of Priam,\n"+
		"In change of him: let him be sent, great princes,\n"+
		"And he shall buy my daughter; and her presence\n"+
		"Shall quite strike off all service I have done,\n"+
		"In most accepted pain.\n"+
		"AGAMEMNON\n"+
		"Let Diomedes bear him,\n"+
		"And bring us Cressid hither: Calchas shall have\n"+
		"What he requests of us. Good Diomed,\n"+
		"Furnish you fairly for this interchange:\n"+
		"Withal bring word if Hector will to-morrow\n"+
		"Be answer'd in his challenge: Ajax is ready.\n"+
		"DIOMEDES\n"+
		"This shall I undertake; and 'tis a burden\n"+
		"Which I am proud to bear.\n"+
		"Exeunt DIOMEDES and CALCHAS\n"+
		"Enter ACHILLES and PATROCLUS, before their tent\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"Achilles stands i' the entrance of his tent:\n"+
		"Please it our general to pass strangely by him,\n"+
		"As if he were forgot; and, princes all,\n"+
		"Lay negligent and loose regard upon him:\n"+
		"I will come last. 'Tis like he'll question me\n"+
		"Why such unplausive eyes are bent on him:\n"+
		"If so, I have derision medicinable,\n"+
		"To use between your strangeness and his pride,\n"+
		"Which his own will shall have desire to drink:\n"+
		"It may be good: pride hath no other glass\n"+
		"To show itself but pride, for supple knees\n"+
		"Feed arrogance and are the proud man's fees.\n"+
		"AGAMEMNON\n"+
		"We'll execute your purpose, and put on\n"+
		"A form of strangeness as we pass along:\n"+
		"So do each lord, and either greet him not,\n"+
		"Or else disdainfully, which shall shake him more\n"+
		"Than if not look'd on. I will lead the way.\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"What, comes the general to speak with me?\n"+
		"You know my mind, I'll fight no more 'gainst Troy.\n"+
		"AGAMEMNON\n"+
		"What says Achilles? would he aught with us?\n"+
		"NESTOR\n"+
		"Would you, my lord, aught with the general?\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"No.\n"+
		"NESTOR\n"+
		"Nothing, my lord.\n"+
		"AGAMEMNON\n"+
		"The better.\n"+
		"Exeunt AGAMEMNON and NESTOR\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"Good day, good day.\n"+
		"MENELAUS\n"+
		"How do you? how do you?\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"What, does the cuckold scorn me?\n"+
		"AJAX\n"+
		"How now, Patroclus!\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"Good morrow, Ajax.\n"+
		"AJAX\n"+
		"Ha?\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"Good morrow.\n"+
		"AJAX\n"+
		"Ay, and good next day too.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"What mean these fellows? Know they not Achilles?\n"+
		"PATROCLUS\n"+
		"They pass by strangely: they were used to bend\n"+
		"To send their smiles before them to Achilles;\n"+
		"To come as humbly as they used to creep\n"+
		"To holy altars.\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"What, am I poor of late?\n"+
		"'Tis certain, greatness, once fall'n out with fortune,\n"+
		"Must fall out with men too: what the declined is\n"+
		"He shall as soon read in the eyes of others\n"+
		"As feel in his own fall; for men, like butterflies,\n"+
		"Show not their mealy wings but to the summer,\n"+
		"And not a man, for being simply man,\n"+
		"Hath any honour, but honour for those honours\n"+
		"That are without him, as place, riches, favour,\n"+
		"Prizes of accident as oft as merit:\n"+
		"Which when they fall, as being slippery standers,\n"+
		"The love that lean'd on them as slippery too,\n"+
		"Do one pluck down another and together\n"+
		"Die in the fall. But 'tis not so with me:\n"+
		"Fortune and I are friends: I do enjoy\n"+
		"At ample point all that I did possess,\n"+
		"Save these men's looks; who do, methinks, find out\n"+
		"Something not worth in me such rich beholding\n"+
		"As they have often given. Here is Ulysses;\n"+
		"I'll interrupt his reading.\n"+
		"How now Ulysses!\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"Now, great Thetis' son!\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"What are you reading?\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"A strange fellow here\n"+
		"Writes me: 'That man, how dearly ever parted,\n"+
		"How much in having, or without or in,\n"+
		"Cannot make boast to have that which he hath,\n"+
		"Nor feels not what he owes, but by reflection;\n"+
		"As when his virtues shining upon others\n"+
		"Heat them and they retort that heat again\n"+
		"To the first giver.'\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"This is not strange, Ulysses.\n"+
		"The beauty that is borne here in the face\n"+
		"The bearer knows not, but commends itself\n"+
		"To others' eyes; nor doth the eye itself,\n"+
		"That most pure spirit of sense, behold itself,\n"+
		"Not going from itself; but eye to eye opposed\n"+
		"Salutes each other with each other's form;\n"+
		"For speculation turns not to itself,\n"+
		"Till it hath travell'd and is mirror'd there\n"+
		"Where it may see itself. This is not strange at all.\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"I do not strain at the position,--\n"+
		"It is familiar,--but at the author's drift;\n"+
		"Who, in his circumstance, expressly proves\n"+
		"That no man is the lord of any thing,\n"+
		"Though in and of him there be much consisting,\n"+
		"Till he communicate his parts to others:\n"+
		"Nor doth he of himself know them for aught\n"+
		"Till he behold them form'd in the applause\n"+
		"Where they're extended; who, like an arch,\n"+
		"reverberates\n"+
		"The voice again, or, like a gate of steel\n"+
		"Fronting the sun, receives and renders back\n"+
		"His figure and his heat. I was much wrapt in this;\n"+
		"And apprehended here immediately\n"+
		"The unknown Ajax.\n"+
		"Heavens, what a man is there! a very horse,\n"+
		"That has he knows not what. Nature, what things there are\n"+
		"Most abject in regard and dear in use!\n"+
		"What things again most dear in the esteem\n"+
		"And poor in worth! Now shall we see to-morrow--\n"+
		"An act that very chance doth throw upon him--\n"+
		"Ajax renown'd. O heavens, what some men do,\n"+
		"While some men leave to do!\n"+
		"How some men creep in skittish fortune's hall,\n"+
		"Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes!\n"+
		"How one man eats into another's pride,\n"+
		"While pride is fasting in his wantonness!\n"+
		"To see these Grecian lords!--why, even already\n"+
		"They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder,\n"+
		"As if his foot were on brave Hector's breast\n"+
		"And great Troy shrieking.\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"I do believe it; for they pass'd by me\n"+
		"As misers do by beggars, neither gave to me\n"+
		"Good word nor look: what, are my deeds forgot?\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,\n"+
		"Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,\n"+
		"A great-sized monster of ingratitudes:\n"+
		"Those scraps are good deeds past; which are devour'd\n"+
		"As fast as they are made, forgot as soon\n"+
		"As done: perseverance, dear my lord,\n"+
		"Keeps honour bright: to have done is to hang\n"+
		"Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail\n"+
		"In monumental mockery. Take the instant way;\n"+
		"For honour travels in a strait so narrow,\n"+
		"Where one but goes abreast: keep then the path;\n"+
		"For emulation hath a thousand sons\n"+
		"That one by one pursue: if you give way,\n"+
		"Or hedge aside from the direct forthright,\n"+
		"Like to an enter'd tide, they all rush by\n"+
		"And leave you hindmost;\n"+
		"Or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank,\n"+
		"Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,\n"+
		"O'er-run and trampled on: then what they do in present,\n"+
		"Though less than yours in past, must o'ertop yours;\n"+
		"For time is like a fashionable host\n"+
		"That slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand,\n"+
		"And with his arms outstretch'd, as he would fly,\n"+
		"Grasps in the comer: welcome ever smiles,\n"+
		"And farewell goes out sighing. O, let not\n"+
		"virtue seek\n"+
		"Remuneration for the thing it was;\n"+
		"For beauty, wit,\n"+
		"High birth, vigour of bone, desert in service,\n"+
		"Love, friendship, charity, are subjects all\n"+
		"To envious and calumniating time.\n"+
		"One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,\n"+
		"That all with one consent praise new-born gawds,\n"+
		"Though they are made and moulded of things past,\n"+
		"And give to dust that is a little gilt\n"+
		"More laud than gilt o'er-dusted.\n"+
		"The present eye praises the present object.\n"+
		"Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,\n"+
		"That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax;\n"+
		"Since things in motion sooner catch the eye\n"+
		"Than what not stirs. The cry went once on thee,\n"+
		"And still it might, and yet it may again,\n"+
		"If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive\n"+
		"And case thy reputation in thy tent;\n"+
		"Whose glorious deeds, but in these fields of late,\n"+
		"Made emulous missions 'mongst the gods themselves\n"+
		"And drave great Mars to faction.\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"Of this my privacy\n"+
		"I have strong reasons.\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"But 'gainst your privacy\n"+
		"The reasons are more potent and heroical:\n"+
		"'Tis known, Achilles, that you are in love\n"+
		"With one of Priam's daughters.\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"Ha! known!\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"Is that a wonder?\n"+
		"The providence that's in a watchful state\n"+
		"Knows almost every grain of Plutus' gold,\n"+
		"Finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deeps,\n"+
		"Keeps place with thought and almost, like the gods,\n"+
		"Does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles.\n"+
		"There is a mystery--with whom relation\n"+
		"Durst never meddle--in the soul of state;\n"+
		"Which hath an operation more divine\n"+
		"Than breath or pen can give expressure to:\n"+
		"All the commerce that you have had with Troy\n"+
		"As perfectly is ours as yours, my lord;\n"+
		"And better would it fit Achilles much\n"+
		"To throw down Hector than Polyxena:\n"+
		"But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home,\n"+
		"When fame shall in our islands sound her trump,\n"+
		"And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing,\n"+
		"'Great Hector's sister did Achilles win,\n"+
		"But our great Ajax bravely beat down him.'\n"+
		"Farewell, my lord: I as your lover speak;\n"+
		"The fool slides o'er the ice that you should break.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"PATROCLUS\n"+
		"To this effect, Achilles, have I moved you:\n"+
		"A woman impudent and mannish grown\n"+
		"Is not more loathed than an effeminate man\n"+
		"In time of action. I stand condemn'd for this;\n"+
		"They think my little stomach to the war\n"+
		"And your great love to me restrains you thus:\n"+
		"Sweet, rouse yourself; and the weak wanton Cupid\n"+
		"Shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold,\n"+
		"And, like a dew-drop from the lion's mane,\n"+
		"Be shook to air.\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"Shall Ajax fight with Hector?\n"+
		"PATROCLUS\n"+
		"Ay, and perhaps receive much honour by him.\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"I see my reputation is at stake\n"+
		"My fame is shrewdly gored.\n"+
		"PATROCLUS\n"+
		"O, then, beware;\n"+
		"Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves:\n"+
		"Omission to do what is necessary\n"+
		"Seals a commission to a blank of danger;\n"+
		"And danger, like an ague, subtly taints\n"+
		"Even then when we sit idly in the sun.\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"Go call Thersites hither, sweet Patroclus:\n"+
		"I'll send the fool to Ajax and desire him\n"+
		"To invite the Trojan lords after the combat\n"+
		"To see us here unarm'd: I have a woman's longing,\n"+
		"An appetite that I am sick withal,\n"+
		"To see great Hector in his weeds of peace,\n"+
		"To talk with him and to behold his visage,\n"+
		"Even to my full of view.\n"+
		"Enter THERSITES\n"+
		"A labour saved!\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"A wonder!\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"What?\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"Ajax goes up and down the field, asking for himself.\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"How so?\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"He must fight singly to-morrow with Hector, and is so\n"+
		"prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he\n"+
		"raves in saying nothing.\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"How can that be?\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"Why, he stalks up and down like a peacock,--a stride\n"+
		"and a stand: ruminates like an hostess that hath no\n"+

		"in a flint, which will not show without knocking.\n"+
		"The man's undone forever; for if Hector break not his\n"+
		"neck i' the combat, he'll break 't himself in\n"+
		"vain-glory. He knows not me: I said 'Good morrow,\n"+

		"ACT IV\n"+
		"SCENE I. Troy. A street.\n"+
		"Enter, from one side, AENEAS, and Servant with a torch; from the other, PARIS, DEIPHOBUS, ANTENOR, DIOMEDES, and others, with torches\n"+
		"PARIS\n"+
		"See, ho! who is that there?\n"+
		"DEIPHOBUS\n"+
		"It is the Lord AEneas.\n"+
		"AENEAS\n"+
		"Is the prince there in person?\n"+
		"Had I so good occasion to lie long\n"+
		"As you, prince Paris, nothing but heavenly business\n"+
		"Should rob my bed-mate of my company.\n"+
		"DIOMEDES\n"+
		"That's my mind too. Good morrow, Lord AEneas.\n"+
		"PARIS\n"+
		"A valiant Greek, AEneas,--take his hand,--\n"+
		"Witness the process of your speech, wherein\n"+
		"You told how Diomed, a whole week by days,\n"+
		"Did haunt you in the field.\n"+
		"AENEAS\n"+
		"Health to you, valiant sir,\n"+
		"During all question of the gentle truce;\n"+
		"But when I meet you arm'd, as black defiance\n"+
		"As heart can think or courage execute.\n"+
		"DIOMEDES\n"+
		"The one and other Diomed embraces.\n"+
		"Our bloods are now in calm; and, so long, health!\n"+
		"But when contention and occasion meet,\n"+
		"By Jove, I'll play the hunter for thy life\n"+
		"With all my force, pursuit and policy.\n"+
		"AENEAS\n"+
		"And thou shalt hunt a lion, that will fly\n"+
		"With his face backward. In humane gentleness,\n"+
		"Welcome to Troy! now, by Anchises' life,\n"+
		"Welcome, indeed! By Venus' hand I swear,\n"+
		"No man alive can love in such a sort\n"+
		"The thing he means to kill more excellently.\n"+
		"DIOMEDES\n"+
		"We sympathize: Jove, let AEneas live,\n"+
		"If to my sword his fate be not the glory,\n"+
		"A thousand complete courses of the sun!\n"+
		"But, in mine emulous honour, let him die,\n"+
		"With every joint a wound, and that to-morrow!\n"+
		"AENEAS\n"+
		"We know each other well.\n"+
		"DIOMEDES\n"+
		"We do; and long to know each other worse.\n"+
		"PARIS\n"+
		"This is the most despiteful gentle greeting,\n"+
		"The noblest hateful love, that e'er I heard of.\n"+
		"What business, lord, so early?\n"+
		"AENEAS\n"+
		"I was sent for to the king; but why, I know not.\n"+
		"PARIS\n"+
		"His purpose meets you: 'twas to bring this Greek\n"+
		"To Calchas' house, and there to render him,\n"+
		"For the enfreed Antenor, the fair Cressid:\n"+
		"Let's have your company, or, if you please,\n"+
		"Haste there before us: I constantly do think--\n"+
		"Or rather, call my thought a certain knowledge--\n"+
		"My brother Troilus lodges there to-night:\n"+
		"Rouse him and give him note of our approach.\n"+
		"With the whole quality wherefore: I fear\n"+
		"We shall be much unwelcome.\n"+
		"AENEAS\n"+
		"That I assure you:\n"+
		"Troilus had rather Troy were borne to Greece\n"+
		"Than Cressid borne from Troy.\n"+
		"PARIS\n"+
		"There is no help;\n"+
		"The bitter disposition of the time\n"+
		"Will have it so. On, lord; we'll follow you.\n"+
		"AENEAS\n"+
		"Good morrow, all.\n"+
		"Exit with Servant\n"+
		"PARIS\n"+
		"And tell me, noble Diomed, faith, tell me true,\n"+
		"Even in the soul of sound good-fellowship,\n"+
		"Who, in your thoughts, merits fair Helen best,\n"+
		"Myself or Menelaus?\n"+
		"DIOMEDES\n"+
		"Both alike:\n"+
		"He merits well to have her, that doth seek her,\n"+
		"Not making any scruple of her soilure,\n"+
		"With such a hell of pain and world of charge,\n"+
		"And you as well to keep her, that defend her,\n"+
		"Not palating the taste of her dishonour,\n"+
		"With such a costly loss of wealth and friends:\n"+
		"He, like a puling cuckold, would drink up\n"+
		"The lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece;\n"+
		"You, like a lecher, out of whorish loins\n"+
		"Are pleased to breed out your inheritors:\n"+
		"Both merits poised, each weighs nor less nor more;\n"+
		"But he as he, the heavier for a whore.\n"+
		"PARIS\n"+
		"You are too bitter to your countrywoman.\n"+
		"DIOMEDES\n"+
		"She's bitter to her country: hear me, Paris:\n"+
		"For every false drop in her bawdy veins\n"+
		"A Grecian's life hath sunk; for every scruple\n"+
		"Of her contaminated carrion weight,\n"+
		"A Trojan hath been slain: since she could speak,\n"+
		"She hath not given so many good words breath\n"+
		"As for her Greeks and Trojans suffer'd death.\n"+
		"PARIS\n"+
		"Fair Diomed, you do as chapmen do,\n"+
		"Dispraise the thing that you desire to buy:\n"+
		"But we in silence hold this virtue well,\n"+
		"We'll but commend what we intend to sell.\n"+
		"Here lies our way.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. The same. Court of Pandarus' house.\n"+
		"Enter TROILUS and CRESSIDA\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Dear, trouble not yourself: the morn is cold.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Then, sweet my lord, I'll call mine uncle down;\n"+
		"He shall unbolt the gates.\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Trouble him not;\n"+
		"To bed, to bed: sleep kill those pretty eyes,\n"+
		"And give as soft attachment to thy senses\n"+
		"As infants' empty of all thought!\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Good morrow, then.\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"I prithee now, to bed.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Are you a-weary of me?\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"O Cressida! but that the busy day,\n"+
		"Waked by the lark, hath roused the ribald crows,\n"+
		"And dreaming night will hide our joys no longer,\n"+
		"I would not from thee.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Night hath been too brief.\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Beshrew the witch! with venomous wights she stays\n"+
		"As tediously as hell, but flies the grasps of love\n"+
		"With wings more momentary-swift than thought.\n"+
		"You will catch cold, and curse me.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Prithee, tarry:\n"+
		"You men will never tarry.\n"+
		"O foolish Cressid! I might have still held off,\n"+
		"And then you would have tarried. Hark!\n"+
		"there's one up.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"[Within] What, 's all the doors open here?\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"It is your uncle.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"A pestilence on him! now will he be mocking:\n"+
		"I shall have such a life!\n"+
		"Enter PANDARUS\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"How now, how now! how go maidenheads? Here, you\n"+
		"maid! where's my cousin Cressid?\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Go hang yourself, you naughty mocking uncle!\n"+
		"You bring me to do, and then you flout me too.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"To do what? to do what? let her say\n"+
		"what: what have I brought you to do?\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Come, come, beshrew your heart! you'll ne'er be good,\n"+
		"Nor suffer others.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Ha! ha! Alas, poor wretch! ah, poor capocchia!\n"+
		"hast not slept to-night? would he not, a naughty\n"+
		"man, let it sleep? a bugbear take him!\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Did not I tell you? Would he were knock'd i' the head!\n"+
		"Knocking within\n"+
		"Who's that at door? good uncle, go and see.\n"+
		"My lord, come you again into my chamber:\n"+
		"You smile and mock me, as if I meant naughtily.\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Ha, ha!\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Come, you are deceived, I think of no such thing.\n"+
		"Knocking within\n"+
		"How earnestly they knock! Pray you, come in:\n"+
		"I would not for half Troy have you seen here.\n"+
		"Exeunt TROILUS and CRESSIDA\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Who's there? what's the matter? will you beat\n"+
		"down the door? How now! what's the matter?\n"+
		"Enter AENEAS\n"+
		"AENEAS\n"+
		"Good morrow, lord, good morrow.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Who's there? my Lord AEneas! By my troth,\n"+
		"I knew you not: what news with you so early?\n"+
		"AENEAS\n"+
		"Is not Prince Troilus here?\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Here! what should he do here?\n"+
		"AENEAS\n"+
		"Come, he is here, my lord; do not deny him:\n"+
		"It doth import him much to speak with me.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Is he here, say you? 'tis more than I know, I'll\n"+
		"be sworn: for my own part, I came in late. What\n"+
		"should he do here?\n"+
		"AENEAS\n"+
		"Who!--nay, then: come, come, you'll do him wrong\n"+
		"ere you're ware: you'll be so true to him, to be\n"+
		"false to him: do not you know of him, but yet go\n"+
		"fetch him hither; go.\n"+
		"Re-enter TROILUS\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"How now! what's the matter?\n"+
		"AENEAS\n"+
		"My lord, I scarce have leisure to salute you,\n"+
		"My matter is so rash: there is at hand\n"+
		"Paris your brother, and Deiphobus,\n"+
		"The Grecian Diomed, and our Antenor\n"+
		"Deliver'd to us; and for him forthwith,\n"+
		"Ere the first sacrifice, within this hour,\n"+
		"We must give up to Diomedes' hand\n"+
		"The Lady Cressida.\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Is it so concluded?\n"+
		"AENEAS\n"+
		"By Priam and the general state of Troy:\n"+
		"They are at hand and ready to effect it.\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"How my achievements mock me!\n"+
		"I will go meet them: and, my Lord AEneas,\n"+
		"We met by chance; you did not find me here.\n"+
		"AENEAS\n"+
		"Good, good, my lord; the secrets of nature\n"+
		"Have not more gift in taciturnity.\n"+
		"Exeunt TROILUS and AENEAS\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Is't possible? no sooner got but lost? The devil\n"+
		"take Antenor! the young prince will go mad: a\n"+
		"plague upon Antenor! I would they had broke 's neck!\n"+
		"Re-enter CRESSIDA\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"How now! what's the matter? who was here?\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Ah, ah!\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Why sigh you so profoundly? where's my lord? gone!\n"+
		"Tell me, sweet uncle, what's the matter?\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Would I were as deep under the earth as I am above!\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"O the gods! what's the matter?\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Prithee, get thee in: would thou hadst ne'er been\n"+
		"born! I knew thou wouldst be his death. O, poor\n"+
		"gentleman! A plague upon Antenor!\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Good uncle, I beseech you, on my knees! beseech you,\n"+
		"what's the matter?\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Thou must be gone, wench, thou must be gone; thou\n"+
		"art changed for Antenor: thou must to thy father,\n"+
		"and be gone from Troilus: 'twill be his death;\n"+
		"'twill be his bane; he cannot bear it.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"O you immortal gods! I will not go.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Thou must.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"I will not, uncle: I have forgot my father;\n"+
		"I know no touch of consanguinity;\n"+
		"No kin no love, no blood, no soul so near me\n"+
		"As the sweet Troilus. O you gods divine!\n"+
		"Make Cressid's name the very crown of falsehood,\n"+
		"If ever she leave Troilus! Time, force, and death,\n"+
		"Do to this body what extremes you can;\n"+
		"But the strong base and building of my love\n"+
		"Is as the very centre of the earth,\n"+
		"Drawing all things to it. I'll go in and weep,--\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Do, do.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Tear my bright hair and scratch my praised cheeks,\n"+
		"Crack my clear voice with sobs and break my heart\n"+
		"With sounding Troilus. I will not go from Troy.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. The same. Street before Pandarus' house.\n"+
		"Enter PARIS, TROILUS, AENEAS, DEIPHOBUS, ANTENOR, and DIOMEDES\n"+
		"PARIS\n"+
		"It is great morning, and the hour prefix'd\n"+
		"Of her delivery to this valiant Greek\n"+
		"Comes fast upon. Good my brother Troilus,\n"+
		"Tell you the lady what she is to do,\n"+
		"And haste her to the purpose.\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Walk into her house;\n"+
		"I'll bring her to the Grecian presently:\n"+
		"And to his hand when I deliver her,\n"+
		"Think it an altar, and thy brother Troilus\n"+
		"A priest there offering to it his own heart.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"PARIS\n"+
		"I know what 'tis to love;\n"+
		"And would, as I shall pity, I could help!\n"+
		"Please you walk in, my lords.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV. The same. Pandarus' house.\n"+
		"Enter PANDARUS and CRESSIDA\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Be moderate, be moderate.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Why tell you me of moderation?\n"+
		"The grief is fine, full, perfect, that I taste,\n"+
		"And violenteth in a sense as strong\n"+
		"As that which causeth it: how can I moderate it?\n"+
		"If I could temporize with my affection,\n"+
		"Or brew it to a weak and colder palate,\n"+
		"The like allayment could I give my grief.\n"+
		"My love admits no qualifying dross;\n"+
		"No more my grief, in such a precious loss.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Here, here, here he comes.\n"+
		"Enter TROILUS\n"+
		"Ah, sweet ducks!\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"O Troilus! Troilus!\n"+
		"Embracing him\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"What a pair of spectacles is here!\n"+
		"Let me embrace too. 'O heart,' as the goodly saying is,\n"+
		"'--O heart, heavy heart,\n"+
		"Why sigh'st thou without breaking?\n"+
		"where he answers again,\n"+
		"'Because thou canst not ease thy smart\n"+
		"By friendship nor by speaking.'\n"+
		"There was never a truer rhyme. Let us cast away\n"+
		"nothing, for we may live to have need of such a\n"+
		"verse: we see it, we see it. How now, lambs?\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Cressid, I love thee in so strain'd a purity,\n"+
		"That the bless'd gods, as angry with my fancy,\n"+
		"More bright in zeal than the devotion which\n"+
		"Cold lips blow to their deities, take thee from me.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Have the gods envy?\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Ay, ay, ay, ay; 'tis too plain a case.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"And is it true that I must go from Troy?\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"A hateful truth.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"What, and from Troilus too?\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"From Troy and Troilus.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Is it possible?\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"And suddenly; where injury of chance\n"+
		"Puts back leave-taking, justles roughly by\n"+
		"All time of pause, rudely beguiles our lips\n"+
		"Of all rejoindure, forcibly prevents\n"+
		"Our lock'd embrasures, strangles our dear vows\n"+
		"Even in the birth of our own labouring breath:\n"+
		"We two, that with so many thousand sighs\n"+
		"Did buy each other, must poorly sell ourselves\n"+
		"With the rude brevity and discharge of one.\n"+
		"Injurious time now with a robber's haste\n"+
		"Crams his rich thievery up, he knows not how:\n"+
		"As many farewells as be stars in heaven,\n"+
		"With distinct breath and consign'd kisses to them,\n"+
		"He fumbles up into a lose adieu,\n"+
		"And scants us with a single famish'd kiss,\n"+
		"Distasted with the salt of broken tears.\n"+
		"AENEAS\n"+
		"[Within] My lord, is the lady ready?\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Hark! you are call'd: some say the Genius so\n"+
		"Cries 'come' to him that instantly must die.\n"+
		"Bid them have patience; she shall come anon.\n"+
		"PANDARUS\n"+
		"Where are my tears? rain, to lay this wind, or\n"+
		"my heart will be blown up by the root.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"I must then to the Grecians?\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"No remedy.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"A woful Cressid 'mongst the merry Greeks!\n"+
		"When shall we see again?\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Hear me, my love: be thou but true of heart,--\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"I true! how now! what wicked deem is this?\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Nay, we must use expostulation kindly,\n"+
		"For it is parting from us:\n"+
		"I speak not 'be thou true,' as fearing thee,\n"+
		"For I will throw my glove to Death himself,\n"+
		"That there's no maculation in thy heart:\n"+
		"But 'be thou true,' say I, to fashion in\n"+
		"My sequent protestation; be thou true,\n"+
		"And I will see thee.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"O, you shall be exposed, my lord, to dangers\n"+
		"As infinite as imminent! but I'll be true.\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"And I'll grow friend with danger. Wear this sleeve.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"And you this glove. When shall I see you?\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"I will corrupt the Grecian sentinels,\n"+
		"To give thee nightly visitation.\n"+
		"But yet be true.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"O heavens! 'be true' again!\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Hear while I speak it, love:\n"+
		"The Grecian youths are full of quality;\n"+
		"They're loving, well composed with gifts of nature,\n"+
		"Flowing and swelling o'er with arts and exercise:\n"+
		"How novelty may move, and parts with person,\n"+
		"Alas, a kind of godly jealousy--\n"+
		"Which, I beseech you, call a virtuous sin--\n"+
		"Makes me afeard.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"O heavens! you love me not.\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Die I a villain, then!\n"+
		"In this I do not call your faith in question\n"+
		"So mainly as my merit: I cannot sing,\n"+
		"Nor heel the high lavolt, nor sweeten talk,\n"+
		"Nor play at subtle games; fair virtues all,\n"+
		"To which the Grecians are most prompt and pregnant:\n"+
		"But I can tell that in each grace of these\n"+
		"There lurks a still and dumb-discoursive devil\n"+
		"That tempts most cunningly: but be not tempted.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Do you think I will?\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"No.\n"+
		"But something may be done that we will not:\n"+
		"And sometimes we are devils to ourselves,\n"+
		"When we will tempt the frailty of our powers,\n"+
		"Presuming on their changeful potency.\n"+
		"AENEAS\n"+
		"[Within] Nay, good my lord,--\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Come, kiss; and let us part.\n"+
		"PARIS\n"+
		"[Within] Brother Troilus!\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Good brother, come you hither;\n"+
		"And bring AEneas and the Grecian with you.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"My lord, will you be true?\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Who, I? alas, it is my vice, my fault:\n"+
		"Whiles others fish with craft for great opinion,\n"+
		"I with great truth catch mere simplicity;\n"+
		"Whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns,\n"+
		"With truth and plainness I do wear mine bare.\n"+
		"Fear not my truth: the moral of my wit\n"+
		"Is 'plain and true;' there's all the reach of it.\n"+
		"Enter AENEAS, PARIS, ANTENOR, DEIPHOBUS, and DIOMEDES\n"+
		"Welcome, Sir Diomed! here is the lady\n"+
		"Which for Antenor we deliver you:\n"+
		"At the port, lord, I'll give her to thy hand,\n"+
		"And by the way possess thee what she is.\n"+
		"Entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek,\n"+
		"If e'er thou stand at mercy of my sword,\n"+

		"Pleads your fair usage; and to Diomed\n"+
		"You shall be mistress, and command him wholly.\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Grecian, thou dost not use me courteously,\n"+
		"To shame the zeal of my petition to thee\n"+
		"In praising her: I tell thee, lord of Greece,\n"+
		"She is as far high-soaring o'er thy praises\n"+
		"As thou unworthy to be call'd her servant.\n"+
		"I charge thee use her well, even for my charge;\n"+
		"For, by the dreadful Pluto, if thou dost not,\n"+
		"Though the great bulk Achilles be thy guard,\n"+
		"I'll cut thy throat.\n"+
		"DIOMEDES\n"+
		"O, be not moved, Prince Troilus:\n"+
		"Let me be privileged by my place and message,\n"+
		"To be a speaker free; when I am hence\n"+
		"I'll answer to my lust: and know you, lord,\n"+
		"I'll nothing do on charge: to her own worth\n"+
		"She shall be prized; but that you say 'be't so,'\n"+
		"I'll speak it in my spirit and honour, 'no.'\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Come, to the port. I'll tell thee, Diomed,\n"+
		"This brave shall oft make thee to hide thy head.\n"+
		"Lady, give me your hand, and, as we walk,\n"+
		"To our own selves bend we our needful talk.\n"+
		"Exeunt TROILUS, CRESSIDA, and DIOMEDES\n"+
		"Trumpet within\n"+
		"PARIS\n"+
		"Hark! Hector's trumpet.\n"+
		"AENEAS\n"+
		"How have we spent this morning!\n"+
		"The prince must think me tardy and remiss,\n"+
		"That sore to ride before him to the field.\n"+
		"PARIS\n"+
		"'Tis Troilus' fault: come, come, to field with him.\n"+
		"DEIPHOBUS\n"+
		"Let us make ready straight.\n"+
		"AENEAS\n"+
		"Yea, with a bridegroom's fresh alacrity,\n"+
		"Let us address to tend on Hector's heels:\n"+
		"The glory of our Troy doth this day lie\n"+
		"On his fair worth and single chivalry.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE V. The Grecian camp. Lists set out.\n"+
		"Enter AJAX, armed; AGAMEMNON, ACHILLES, PATROCLUS, MENELAUS, ULYSSES, NESTOR, and others\n"+
		"AGAMEMNON\n"+
		"Here art thou in appointment fresh and fair,\n"+
		"Anticipating time with starting courage.\n"+
		"Give with thy trumpet a loud note to Troy,\n"+
		"Thou dreadful Ajax; that the appalled air\n"+
		"May pierce the head of the great combatant\n"+
		"And hale him hither.\n"+
		"AJAX\n"+
		"Thou, trumpet, there's my purse.\n"+
		"Now crack thy lungs, and split thy brazen pipe:\n"+
		"Blow, villain, till thy sphered bias cheek\n"+
		"Outswell the colic of puff'd Aquilon:\n"+
		"Come, stretch thy chest and let thy eyes spout blood;\n"+
		"Thou blow'st for Hector.\n"+
		"Trumpet sounds\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"No trumpet answers.\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"'Tis but early days.\n"+
		"AGAMEMNON\n"+
		"Is not yond Diomed, with Calchas' daughter?\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"'Tis he, I ken the manner of his gait;\n"+
		"He rises on the toe: that spirit of his\n"+
		"In aspiration lifts him from the earth.\n"+
		"Enter DIOMEDES, with CRESSIDA\n"+
		"AGAMEMNON\n"+
		"Is this the Lady Cressid?\n"+
		"DIOMEDES\n"+
		"Even she.\n"+
		"AGAMEMNON\n"+
		"Most dearly welcome to the Greeks, sweet lady.\n"+
		"NESTOR\n"+
		"Our general doth salute you with a kiss.\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"Yet is the kindness but particular;\n"+
		"'Twere better she were kiss'd in general.\n"+
		"NESTOR\n"+
		"And very courtly counsel: I'll begin.\n"+
		"So much for Nestor.\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"I'll take what winter from your lips, fair lady:\n"+
		"Achilles bids you welcome.\n"+
		"MENELAUS\n"+
		"I had good argument for kissing once.\n"+
		"PATROCLUS\n"+
		"But that's no argument for kissing now;\n"+
		"For this popp'd Paris in his hardiment,\n"+
		"And parted thus you and your argument.\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"O deadly gall, and theme of all our scorns!\n"+
		"For which we lose our heads to gild his horns.\n"+
		"PATROCLUS\n"+
		"The first was Menelaus' kiss; this, mine:\n"+
		"Patroclus kisses you.\n"+
		"MENELAUS\n"+
		"O, this is trim!\n"+
		"PATROCLUS\n"+
		"Paris and I kiss evermore for him.\n"+
		"MENELAUS\n"+
		"I'll have my kiss, sir. Lady, by your leave.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"In kissing, do you render or receive?\n"+
		"PATROCLUS\n"+
		"Both take and give.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"I'll make my match to live,\n"+
		"The kiss you take is better than you give;\n"+
		"Therefore no kiss.\n"+
		"MENELAUS\n"+
		"I'll give you boot, I'll give you three for one.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"You're an odd man; give even or give none.\n"+
		"MENELAUS\n"+
		"An odd man, lady! every man is odd.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"No, Paris is not; for you know 'tis true,\n"+
		"That you are odd, and he is even with you.\n"+
		"MENELAUS\n"+
		"You fillip me o' the head.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"No, I'll be sworn.\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"It were no match, your nail against his horn.\n"+
		"May I, sweet lady, beg a kiss of you?\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"You may.\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"I do desire it.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Why, beg, then.\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"Why then for Venus' sake, give me a kiss,\n"+
		"When Helen is a maid again, and his.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"I am your debtor, claim it when 'tis due.\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"Never's my day, and then a kiss of you.\n"+
		"DIOMEDES\n"+
		"Lady, a word: I'll bring you to your father.\n"+
		"Exit with CRESSIDA\n"+
		"NESTOR\n"+
		"A woman of quick sense.\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"Fie, fie upon her!\n"+
		"There's language in her eye, her cheek, her lip,\n"+
		"Nay, her foot speaks; her wanton spirits look out\n"+
		"At every joint and motive of her body.\n"+
		"O, these encounterers, so glib of tongue,\n"+
		"That give accosting welcome ere it comes,\n"+
		"And wide unclasp the tables of their thoughts\n"+
		"To every ticklish reader! set them down\n"+
		"For sluttish spoils of opportunity\n"+
		"And daughters of the game.\n"+
		"Trumpet within\n"+
		"ALL\n"+
		"The Trojans' trumpet.\n"+
		"AGAMEMNON\n"+
		"Yonder comes the troop.\n"+
		"Enter HECTOR, armed; AENEAS, TROILUS, and other Trojans, with Attendants\n"+
		"AENEAS\n"+
		"Hail, all you state of Greece! what shall be done\n"+
		"To him that victory commands? or do you purpose\n"+
		"A victor shall be known? will you the knights\n"+
		"Shall to the edge of all extremity\n"+
		"Pursue each other, or shall be divided\n"+
		"By any voice or order of the field?\n"+
		"Hector bade ask.\n"+
		"AGAMEMNON\n"+
		"Which way would Hector have it?\n"+
		"AENEAS\n"+
		"He cares not; he'll obey conditions.\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"'Tis done like Hector; but securely done,\n"+
		"A little proudly, and great deal misprizing\n"+
		"The knight opposed.\n"+
		"AENEAS\n"+
		"If not Achilles, sir,\n"+
		"What is your name?\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"If not Achilles, nothing.\n"+
		"AENEAS\n"+
		"Therefore Achilles: but, whate'er, know this:\n"+
		"In the extremity of great and little,\n"+
		"Valour and pride excel themselves in Hector;\n"+
		"The one almost as infinite as all,\n"+
		"The other blank as nothing. Weigh him well,\n"+
		"And that which looks like pride is courtesy.\n"+
		"This Ajax is half made of Hector's blood:\n"+
		"In love whereof, half Hector stays at home;\n"+
		"Half heart, half hand, half Hector comes to seek\n"+
		"This blended knight, half Trojan and half Greek.\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"A maiden battle, then? O, I perceive you.\n"+
		"Re-enter DIOMEDES\n"+
		"AGAMEMNON\n"+
		"Here is Sir Diomed. Go, gentle knight,\n"+
		"Stand by our Ajax: as you and Lord AEneas\n"+
		"Consent upon the order of their fight,\n"+
		"So be it; either to the uttermost,\n"+
		"Or else a breath: the combatants being kin\n"+
		"Half stints their strife before their strokes begin.\n"+
		"AJAX and HECTOR enter the lists\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"They are opposed already.\n"+
		"AGAMEMNON\n"+
		"What Trojan is that same that looks so heavy?\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"The youngest son of Priam, a true knight,\n"+
		"Not yet mature, yet matchless, firm of word,\n"+
		"Speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue;\n"+
		"Not soon provoked nor being provoked soon calm'd:\n"+
		"His heart and hand both open and both free;\n"+
		"For what he has he gives, what thinks he shows;\n"+
		"Yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty,\n"+
		"Nor dignifies an impure thought with breath;\n"+
		"Manly as Hector, but more dangerous;\n"+
		"For Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes\n"+
		"To tender objects, but he in heat of action\n"+
		"Is more vindicative than jealous love:\n"+
		"They call him Troilus, and on him erect\n"+
		"A second hope, as fairly built as Hector.\n"+
		"Thus says AEneas; one that knows the youth\n"+
		"Even to his inches, and with private soul\n"+
		"Did in great Ilion thus translate him to me.\n"+
		"Alarum. Hector and Ajax fight\n"+
		"AGAMEMNON\n"+
		"They are in action.\n"+
		"NESTOR\n"+
		"Now, Ajax, hold thine own!\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Hector, thou sleep'st;\n"+
		"Awake thee!\n"+
		"AGAMEMNON\n"+
		"His blows are well disposed: there, Ajax!\n"+
		"DIOMEDES\n"+
		"You must no more.\n"+
		"Trumpets cease\n"+
		"AENEAS\n"+
		"Princes, enough, so please you.\n"+
		"AJAX\n"+
		"I am not warm yet; let us fight again.\n"+
		"DIOMEDES\n"+
		"As Hector pleases.\n"+
		"HECTOR\n"+
		"Why, then will I no more:\n"+
		"Thou art, great lord, my father's sister's son,\n"+
		"A cousin-german to great Priam's seed;\n"+
		"The obligation of our blood forbids\n"+
		"A gory emulation 'twixt us twain:\n"+
		"Were thy commixtion Greek and Trojan so\n"+
		"That thou couldst say 'This hand is Grecian all,\n"+
		"And this is Trojan; the sinews of this leg\n"+
		"All Greek, and this all Troy; my mother's blood\n"+
		"Runs on the dexter cheek, and this sinister\n"+
		"Bounds in my father's;' by Jove multipotent,\n"+
		"Thou shouldst not bear from me a Greekish member\n"+
		"Wherein my sword had not impressure made\n"+
		"Of our rank feud: but the just gods gainsay\n"+
		"That any drop thou borrow'dst from thy mother,\n"+
		"My sacred aunt, should by my mortal sword\n"+
		"Be drain'd! Let me embrace thee, Ajax:\n"+
		"By him that thunders, thou hast lusty arms;\n"+
		"Hector would have them fall upon him thus:\n"+
		"Cousin, all honour to thee!\n"+
		"AJAX\n"+
		"I thank thee, Hector\n"+
		"Thou art too gentle and too free a man:\n"+
		"I came to kill thee, cousin, and bear hence\n"+
		"A great addition earned in thy death.\n"+
		"HECTOR\n"+
		"Not Neoptolemus so mirable,\n"+
		"On whose bright crest Fame with her loud'st Oyes\n"+
		"Cries 'This is he,' could promise to himself\n"+
		"A thought of added honour torn from Hector.\n"+
		"AENEAS\n"+
		"There is expectance here from both the sides,\n"+
		"What further you will do.\n"+
		"HECTOR\n"+
		"We'll answer it;\n"+
		"The issue is embracement: Ajax, farewell.\n"+
		"AJAX\n"+
		"If I might in entreaties find success--\n"+
		"As seld I have the chance--I would desire\n"+
		"My famous cousin to our Grecian tents.\n"+
		"DIOMEDES\n"+
		"'Tis Agamemnon's wish, and great Achilles\n"+
		"Doth long to see unarm'd the valiant Hector.\n"+
		"HECTOR\n"+
		"AEneas, call my brother Troilus to me,\n"+
		"And signify this loving interview\n"+
		"To the expecters of our Trojan part;\n"+
		"Desire them home. Give me thy hand, my cousin;\n"+
		"I will go eat with thee and see your knights.\n"+
		"AJAX\n"+
		"Great Agamemnon comes to meet us here.\n"+
		"HECTOR\n"+
		"The worthiest of them tell me name by name;\n"+
		"But for Achilles, mine own searching eyes\n"+
		"Shall find him by his large and portly size.\n"+
		"AGAMEMNON\n"+
		"Worthy of arms! as welcome as to one\n"+
		"That would be rid of such an enemy;\n"+
		"But that's no welcome: understand more clear,\n"+
		"What's past and what's to come is strew'd with husks\n"+
		"And formless ruin of oblivion;\n"+
		"But in this extant moment, faith and troth,\n"+
		"Strain'd purely from all hollow bias-drawing,\n"+
		"Bids thee, with most divine integrity,\n"+
		"From heart of very heart, great Hector, welcome.\n"+
		"HECTOR\n"+
		"I thank thee, most imperious Agamemnon.\n"+
		"AGAMEMNON\n"+
		"[To TROILUS] My well-famed lord of Troy, no\n"+
		"less to you.\n"+
		"MENELAUS\n"+
		"Let me confirm my princely brother's greeting:\n"+
		"You brace of warlike brothers, welcome hither.\n"+
		"HECTOR\n"+
		"Who must we answer?\n"+
		"AENEAS\n"+
		"The noble Menelaus.\n"+
		"HECTOR\n"+
		"O, you, my lord? by Mars his gauntlet, thanks!\n"+
		"Mock not, that I affect the untraded oath;\n"+
		"Your quondam wife swears still by Venus' glove:\n"+
		"She's well, but bade me not commend her to you.\n"+
		"MENELAUS\n"+
		"Name her not now, sir; she's a deadly theme.\n"+
		"HECTOR\n"+
		"O, pardon; I offend.\n"+
		"NESTOR\n"+
		"I have, thou gallant Trojan, seen thee oft\n"+
		"Labouring for destiny make cruel way\n"+
		"Through ranks of Greekish youth, and I have seen thee,\n"+
		"As hot as Perseus, spur thy Phrygian steed,\n"+
		"Despising many forfeits and subduements,\n"+
		"When thou hast hung thy advanced sword i' the air,\n"+
		"Not letting it decline on the declined,\n"+
		"That I have said to some my standers by\n"+
		"'Lo, Jupiter is yonder, dealing life!'\n"+
		"And I have seen thee pause and take thy breath,\n"+
		"When that a ring of Greeks have hemm'd thee in,\n"+
		"Like an Olympian wrestling: this have I seen;\n"+
		"But this thy countenance, still lock'd in steel,\n"+
		"I never saw till now. I knew thy grandsire,\n"+
		"And once fought with him: he was a soldier good;\n"+
		"But, by great Mars, the captain of us all,\n"+
		"Never saw like thee. Let an old man embrace thee;\n"+
		"And, worthy warrior, welcome to our tents.\n"+
		"AENEAS\n"+
		"'Tis the old Nestor.\n"+
		"HECTOR\n"+
		"Let me embrace thee, good old chronicle,\n"+
		"That hast so long walk'd hand in hand with time:\n"+
		"Most reverend Nestor, I am glad to clasp thee.\n"+
		"NESTOR\n"+
		"I would my arms could match thee in contention,\n"+
		"As they contend with thee in courtesy.\n"+
		"HECTOR\n"+
		"I would they could.\n"+
		"NESTOR\n"+
		"Ha!\n"+
		"By this white beard, I'ld fight with thee to-morrow.\n"+
		"Well, welcome, welcome! I have seen the time.\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"I wonder now how yonder city stands\n"+
		"When we have here her base and pillar by us.\n"+
		"HECTOR\n"+
		"I know your favour, Lord Ulysses, well.\n"+
		"Ah, sir, there's many a Greek and Trojan dead,\n"+
		"Since first I saw yourself and Diomed\n"+
		"In Ilion, on your Greekish embassy.\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"Sir, I foretold you then what would ensue:\n"+
		"My prophecy is but half his journey yet;\n"+
		"For yonder walls, that pertly front your town,\n"+
		"Yond towers, whose wanton tops do buss the clouds,\n"+
		"Must kiss their own feet.\n"+
		"HECTOR\n"+
		"I must not believe you:\n"+
		"There they stand yet, and modestly I think,\n"+
		"The fall of every Phrygian stone will cost\n"+
		"A drop of Grecian blood: the end crowns all,\n"+
		"And that old common arbitrator, Time,\n"+
		"Will one day end it.\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"So to him we leave it.\n"+
		"Most gentle and most valiant Hector, welcome:\n"+
		"After the general, I beseech you next\n"+
		"To feast with me and see me at my tent.\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"I shall forestall thee, Lord Ulysses, thou!\n"+
		"Now, Hector, I have fed mine eyes on thee;\n"+
		"I have with exact view perused thee, Hector,\n"+
		"And quoted joint by joint.\n"+
		"HECTOR\n"+
		"Is this Achilles?\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"I am Achilles.\n"+
		"HECTOR\n"+
		"Stand fair, I pray thee: let me look on thee.\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"Behold thy fill.\n"+
		"HECTOR\n"+
		"Nay, I have done already.\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"Thou art too brief: I will the second time,\n"+
		"As I would buy thee, view thee limb by limb.\n"+
		"HECTOR\n"+
		"O, like a book of sport thou'lt read me o'er;\n"+
		"But there's more in me than thou understand'st.\n"+
		"Why dost thou so oppress me with thine eye?\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"Tell me, you heavens, in which part of his body\n"+
		"Shall I destroy him? whether there, or there, or there?\n"+
		"That I may give the local wound a name\n"+
		"And make distinct the very breach whereout\n"+
		"Hector's great spirit flew: answer me, heavens!\n"+
		"HECTOR\n"+
		"It would discredit the blest gods, proud man,\n"+
		"To answer such a question: stand again:\n"+
		"Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly\n"+
		"As to prenominate in nice conjecture\n"+
		"Where thou wilt hit me dead?\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"I tell thee, yea.\n"+
		"HECTOR\n"+
		"Wert thou an oracle to tell me so,\n"+
		"I'd not believe thee. Henceforth guard thee well;\n"+
		"For I'll not kill thee there, nor there, nor there;\n"+
		"But, by the forge that stithied Mars his helm,\n"+
		"I'll kill thee every where, yea, o'er and o'er.\n"+
		"You wisest Grecians, pardon me this brag;\n"+
		"His insolence draws folly from my lips;\n"+
		"But I'll endeavour deeds to match these words,\n"+
		"Or may I never--\n"+
		"AJAX\n"+
		"Do not chafe thee, cousin:\n"+
		"And you, Achilles, let these threats alone,\n"+
		"Till accident or purpose bring you to't:\n"+
		"You may have every day enough of Hector\n"+
		"If you have stomach; the general state, I fear,\n"+
		"Can scarce entreat you to be odd with him.\n"+
		"HECTOR\n"+
		"I pray you, let us see you in the field:\n"+
		"We have had pelting wars, since you refused\n"+
		"The Grecians' cause.\n"+
		"ACHILLES\n"+
		"Dost thou entreat me, Hector?\n"+
		"To-morrow do I meet thee, fell as death;\n"+
		"To-night all friends.\n"+
		"HECTOR\n"+
		"Thy hand upon that match.\n"+
		"AGAMEMNON\n"+
		"First, all you peers of Greece, go to my tent;\n"+
		"There in the full convive we: afterwards,\n"+
		"As Hector's leisure and your bounties shall\n"+
		"Concur together, severally entreat him.\n"+
		"Beat loud the tabourines, let the trumpets blow,\n"+
		"That this great soldier may his welcome know.\n"+
		"Exeunt all except TROILUS and ULYSSES\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"My Lord Ulysses, tell me, I beseech you,\n"+
		"In what place of the field doth Calchas keep?\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"At Menelaus' tent, most princely Troilus:\n"+
		"There Diomed doth feast with him to-night;\n"+
		"Who neither looks upon the heaven nor earth,\n"+
		"But gives all gaze and bent of amorous view\n"+
		"On the fair Cressid.\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Shall sweet lord, be bound to you so much,\n"+
		"After we part from Agamemnon's tent,\n"+
		"To bring me thither?\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"You shall command me, sir.\n"+
		"As gentle tell me, of what honour was\n"+
		"This Cressida in Troy? Had she no lover there\n"+
		"That wails her absence?\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"O, sir, to such as boasting show their scars\n"+
		"A mock is due. Will you walk on, my lord?\n"+
		"She was beloved, she loved; she is, and doth:\n"+
		"But still sweet love is food for fortune's tooth.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+

		"Why, thou full dish of fool, from Troy.\n"+
		"PATROCLUS\n"+
		"Who keeps the tent now?\n"+

		"thou art thought to be Achilles' male varlet.\n"+
		"PATROCLUS\n"+
		"Male varlet, you rogue! what's that?\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"Why, his masculine whore. Now, the rotten diseases\n"+

		"palsies, raw eyes, dirt-rotten livers, wheezing\n"+

		"In faith, I do not: come hither once again.\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"You shake, my lord, at something: will you go?\n"+

		"She strokes his cheek!\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"Come, come.\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Nay, stay; by Jove, I will not speak a word:\n"+

		"A guard of patience: stay a little while.\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"How the devil Luxury, with his fat rump and\n"+

		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"In faith, I will, la; never trust me else.\n"+
		"DIOMEDES\n"+

		"DIOMEDES\n"+
		"Ay, that.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"O, all you gods! O pretty, pretty pledge!\n"+
		"Thy master now lies thinking in his bed\n"+
		"Of thee and me, and sighs, and takes my glove,\n"+

		"As I kiss thee. Nay, do not snatch it from me;\n"+
		"He that takes that doth take my heart withal.\n"+
		"DIOMEDES\n"+
		"I had your heart before, this follows it.\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"I did swear patience.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"You shall not have it, Diomed; faith, you shall not;\n"+
		"I'll give you something else.\n"+
		"DIOMEDES\n"+
		"I will have this: whose was it?\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"It is no matter.\n"+
		"DIOMEDES\n"+
		"Come, tell me whose it was.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"'Twas one's that loved me better than you will.\n"+

		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"By all Diana's waiting-women yond,\n"+
		"And by herself, I will not tell you whose.\n"+

		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Wert thou the devil, and worest it on thy horn,\n"+
		"It should be challenged.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Well, well, 'tis done, 'tis past: and yet it is not;\n"+

		"DIOMEDES\n"+
		"Why, then, farewell;\n"+
		"Thou never shalt mock Diomed again.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"You shall not go: one cannot speak a word,\n"+
		"But it straight starts you.\n"+
		"DIOMEDES\n"+
		"I do not like this fooling.\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"Nor I, by Pluto: but that that likes not you pleases me best.\n"+
		"DIOMEDES\n"+
		"What, shall I come? the hour?\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Ay, come:--O Jove!--do come:--I shall be plagued.\n"+
		"DIOMEDES\n"+
		"Farewell till then.\n"+
		"CRESSIDA\n"+
		"Good night: I prithee, come.\n"+
		"Exit DIOMEDES\n"+
		"Troilus, farewell! one eye yet looks on thee\n"+
		"But with my heart the other eye doth see.\n"+
		"Ah, poor our sex! this fault in us I find,\n"+
		"The error of our eye directs our mind:\n"+
		"What error leads must err; O, then conclude\n"+
		"Minds sway'd by eyes are full of turpitude.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"A proof of strength she could not publish more,\n"+

		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"All's done, my lord.\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"It is.\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"Why stay we, then?\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"To make a recordation to my soul\n"+
		"Of every syllable that here was spoke.\n"+
		"But if I tell how these two did co-act,\n"+
		"Shall I not lie in publishing a truth?\n"+
		"Sith yet there is a credence in my heart,\n"+
		"An esperance so obstinately strong,\n"+
		"That doth invert the attest of eyes and ears,\n"+
		"As if those organs had deceptious functions,\n"+
		"Created only to calumniate.\n"+
		"Was Cressid here?\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"I cannot conjure, Trojan.\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"She was not, sure.\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"Most sure she was.\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Why, my negation hath no taste of madness.\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"Nor mine, my lord: Cressid was here but now.\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Let it not be believed for womanhood!\n"+
		"Think, we had mothers; do not give advantage\n"+
		"To stubborn critics, apt, without a theme,\n"+
		"For depravation, to square the general sex\n"+
		"By Cressid's rule: rather think this not Cressid.\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"What hath she done, prince, that can soil our mothers?\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Nothing at all, unless that this were she.\n"+
		"THERSITES\n"+
		"Will he swagger himself out on's own eyes?\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"This she? no, this is Diomed's Cressida:\n"+
		"If beauty have a soul, this is not she;\n"+
		"If souls guide vows, if vows be sanctimonies,\n"+
		"If sanctimony be the gods' delight,\n"+
		"If there be rule in unity itself,\n"+
		"This is not she. O madness of discourse,\n"+
		"That cause sets up with and against itself!\n"+
		"Bi-fold authority! where reason can revolt\n"+
		"Without perdition, and loss assume all reason\n"+
		"Without revolt: this is, and is not, Cressid.\n"+
		"Within my soul there doth conduce a fight\n"+
		"Of this strange nature that a thing inseparate\n"+
		"Divides more wider than the sky and earth,\n"+
		"And yet the spacious breadth of this division\n"+
		"Admits no orifex for a point as subtle\n"+
		"As Ariachne's broken woof to enter.\n"+
		"Instance, O instance! strong as Pluto's gates;\n"+
		"Cressid is mine, tied with the bonds of heaven:\n"+
		"Instance, O instance! strong as heaven itself;\n"+
		"The bonds of heaven are slipp'd, dissolved, and loosed;\n"+
		"And with another knot, five-finger-tied,\n"+
		"The fractions of her faith, orts of her love,\n"+
		"The fragments, scraps, the bits and greasy relics\n"+
		"Of her o'er-eaten faith, are bound to Diomed.\n"+
		"ULYSSES\n"+
		"May worthy Troilus be half attach'd\n"+
		"With that which here his passion doth express?\n"+
		"TROILUS\n"+
		"Ay, Greek; and that shall be divulged well\n"+
		"In characters as red as Mars his heart\n"+
		"Inflamed with Venus: never did young man fancy\n"+
		"With so eternal and so fix'd a soul.\n"+
		"Hark, Greek: as much as I do Cressid love,\n"+
		"So much by weight hate I her Diomed:\n"+
		"That sleeve is mine that he'll bear on his helm;\n"+
		"Were it a casque composed by Vulcan's skill,\n"+
		"My sword should bite it: not the dreadful spout\n"+
		"Which shipmen do the hurricano call,\n"+
		"Constringed in mass by the almighty sun,\n"+
		"Shall dizzy with more clamour Neptune's ear\n"+
		"In his descent than shall my prompted sword\n"+

		"ANDROMACHE\n"+
		"O, be persuaded! do not count it holy\n"+
		"To hurt by being just: it is as lawful,\n"+
		"For we would give much, to use violent thefts,\n"+
		"And rob in the behalf of charity.\n"+
		"CASSANDRA\n"+
		"It is the purpose that makes strong the vow;\n"+
		"But vows to every purpose must not hold:\n"+
		"Unarm, sweet Hector.\n"+

		"has got that same scurvy doting foolish young knave's\n"+
		"sleeve of Troy there in his helm: I would fain see\n"+
		"them meet; that that same young Trojan ass, that\n"+
		"loves the whore there, might send that Greekish\n"+
		"whore-masterly villain, with the sleeve, back to the\n"+

		"swearing rascals, that stale old mouse-eaten dry\n"+
		"cheese, Nestor, and that same dog-fox, Ulysses, is\n"+
		"not proved worthy a blackberry: they set me up, in\n"+

		"as bad a kind, Achilles: and now is the cur Ajax\n"+
		"prouder than the cur Achilles, and will not arm\n"+

		"And there lacks work; anon he's there afoot,\n"+
		"And there they fly or die, like scaled sculls\n"+
		"Before the belching whale; then is he yonder,\n"+
		"And there the strawy Greeks, ripe for his edge,\n"+
		"Fall down before him, like the mower's swath:\n"+

		"You understand me not that tell me so:\n"+
		"I do not speak of flight, of fear, of death,\n"+

		"Who shall tell Priam so, or Hecuba?\n"+
		"Let him that will a screech-owl aye be call'd,\n"+
		"Go in to Troy, and say there, Hector's dead:\n"+
		"There is a word will Priam turn to stone;\n"+
		"Make wells and Niobes of the maids and wives,\n"+
		"Cold statues of the youth, and, in a word,\n"+
		"Scare Troy out of itself. But, march away:\n"+
		"Hector is dead; there is no more to say.\n"+
		"Stay yet. You vile abominable tents,\n"+
		"Thus proudly pight upon our Phrygian plains,\n"+
		"Let Titan rise as early as he dare,\n"+

		"No space of earth shall sunder our two hates:\n"+
