		"The First part of King Henry the Sixth\n"+
		"ACT I\n"+
		"SCENE I. Westminster Abbey.\n"+
		"Dead March. Enter the Funeral of KING HENRY the Fifth, attended on by Dukes of BEDFORD, Regent of France; GLOUCESTER, Protector; and EXETER, Earl of WARWICK, the BISHOP OF WINCHESTER, Heralds, & c\n"+
		"BEDFORD\n"+
		"Hung be the heavens with black, yield day to night!\n"+
		"Comets, importing change of times and states,\n"+
		"Brandish your crystal tresses in the sky,\n"+
		"And with them scourge the bad revolting stars\n"+
		"That have consented unto Henry's death!\n"+
		"King Henry the Fifth, too famous to live long!\n"+
		"England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"England ne'er had a king until his time.\n"+
		"Virtue he had, deserving to command:\n"+
		"His brandish'd sword did blind men with his beams:\n"+
		"His arms spread wider than a dragon's wings;\n"+
		"His sparking eyes, replete with wrathful fire,\n"+
		"More dazzled and drove back his enemies\n"+
		"Than mid-day sun fierce bent against their faces.\n"+
		"What should I say? his deeds exceed all speech:\n"+
		"He ne'er lift up his hand but conquered.\n"+
		"EXETER\n"+
		"We mourn in black: why mourn we not in blood?\n"+
		"Henry is dead and never shall revive:\n"+
		"Upon a wooden coffin we attend,\n"+
		"And death's dishonourable victory\n"+
		"We with our stately presence glorify,\n"+
		"Like captives bound to a triumphant car.\n"+
		"What! shall we curse the planets of mishap\n"+
		"That plotted thus our glory's overthrow?\n"+
		"Or shall we think the subtle-witted French\n"+
		"Conjurers and sorcerers, that afraid of him\n"+
		"By magic verses have contrived his end?\n"+
		"BISHOP\n"+
		"OF WINCHESTER\n"+
		"He was a king bless'd of the King of kings.\n"+
		"Unto the French the dreadful judgement-day\n"+
		"So dreadful will not be as was his sight.\n"+
		"The battles of the Lord of hosts he fought:\n"+
		"The church's prayers made him so prosperous.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"The church! where is it? Had not churchmen pray'd,\n"+
		"His thread of life had not so soon decay'd:\n"+
		"None do you like but an effeminate prince,\n"+
		"Whom, like a school-boy, you may over-awe.\n"+
		"BISHOP\n"+
		"OF WINCHESTER\n"+
		"Gloucester, whate'er we like, thou art protector\n"+
		"And lookest to command the prince and realm.\n"+
		"Thy wife is proud; she holdeth thee in awe,\n"+
		"More than God or religious churchmen may.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Name not religion, for thou lovest the flesh,\n"+
		"And ne'er throughout the year to church thou go'st\n"+
		"Except it be to pray against thy foes.\n"+
		"BEDFORD\n"+
		"Cease, cease these jars and rest your minds in peace:\n"+
		"Let's to the altar: heralds, wait on us:\n"+
		"Instead of gold, we'll offer up our arms:\n"+
		"Since arms avail not now that Henry's dead.\n"+
		"Posterity, await for wretched years,\n"+
		"When at their mothers' moist eyes babes shall suck,\n"+
		"Our isle be made a nourish of salt tears,\n"+
		"And none but women left to wail the dead.\n"+
		"Henry the Fifth, thy ghost I invocate:\n"+
		"Prosper this realm, keep it from civil broils,\n"+
		"Combat with adverse planets in the heavens!\n"+
		"A far more glorious star thy soul will make\n"+
		"Than Julius Caesar or bright--\n"+
		"Enter a Messenger\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"My honourable lords, health to you all!\n"+
		"Sad tidings bring I to you out of France,\n"+
		"Of loss, of slaughter and discomfiture:\n"+
		"Guienne, Champagne, Rheims, Orleans,\n"+
		"Paris, Guysors, Poictiers, are all quite lost.\n"+
		"BEDFORD\n"+
		"What say'st thou, man, before dead Henry's corse?\n"+
		"Speak softly, or the loss of those great towns\n"+
		"Will make him burst his lead and rise from death.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Is Paris lost? is Rouen yielded up?\n"+
		"If Henry were recall'd to life again,\n"+
		"These news would cause him once more yield the ghost.\n"+
		"EXETER\n"+
		"How were they lost? what treachery was used?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"No treachery; but want of men and money.\n"+
		"Amongst the soldiers this is muttered,\n"+
		"That here you maintain several factions,\n"+
		"And whilst a field should be dispatch'd and fought,\n"+
		"You are disputing of your generals:\n"+
		"One would have lingering wars with little cost;\n"+
		"Another would fly swift, but wanteth wings;\n"+
		"A third thinks, without expense at all,\n"+
		"By guileful fair words peace may be obtain'd.\n"+
		"Awake, awake, English nobility!\n"+
		"Let not sloth dim your horrors new-begot:\n"+
		"Cropp'd are the flower-de-luces in your arms;\n"+
		"Of England's coat one half is cut away.\n"+
		"EXETER\n"+
		"Were our tears wanting to this funeral,\n"+
		"These tidings would call forth their flowing tides.\n"+
		"BEDFORD\n"+
		"Me they concern; Regent I am of France.\n"+
		"Give me my steeled coat. I'll fight for France.\n"+
		"Away with these disgraceful wailing robes!\n"+
		"Wounds will I lend the French instead of eyes,\n"+
		"To weep their intermissive miseries.\n"+
		"Enter to them another Messenger\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Lords, view these letters full of bad mischance.\n"+
		"France is revolted from the English quite,\n"+
		"Except some petty towns of no import:\n"+
		"The Dauphin Charles is crowned king of Rheims;\n"+
		"The Bastard of Orleans with him is join'd;\n"+
		"Reignier, Duke of Anjou, doth take his part;\n"+
		"The Duke of Alencon flieth to his side.\n"+
		"EXETER\n"+
		"The Dauphin crowned king! all fly to him!\n"+
		"O, whither shall we fly from this reproach?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"We will not fly, but to our enemies' throats.\n"+
		"Bedford, if thou be slack, I'll fight it out.\n"+
		"BEDFORD\n"+
		"Gloucester, why doubt'st thou of my forwardness?\n"+
		"An army have I muster'd in my thoughts,\n"+
		"Wherewith already France is overrun.\n"+
		"Enter another Messenger\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"My gracious lords, to add to your laments,\n"+
		"Wherewith you now bedew King Henry's hearse,\n"+
		"I must inform you of a dismal fight\n"+
		"Betwixt the stout Lord Talbot and the French.\n"+
		"BISHOP\n"+
		"OF WINCHESTER\n"+
		"What! wherein Talbot overcame? is't so?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"O, no; wherein Lord Talbot was o'erthrown:\n"+
		"The circumstance I'll tell you more at large.\n"+
		"The tenth of August last this dreadful lord,\n"+
		"Retiring from the siege of Orleans,\n"+
		"Having full scarce six thousand in his troop.\n"+
		"By three and twenty thousand of the French\n"+
		"Was round encompassed and set upon.\n"+
		"No leisure had he to enrank his men;\n"+
		"He wanted pikes to set before his archers;\n"+
		"Instead whereof sharp stakes pluck'd out of hedges\n"+
		"They pitched in the ground confusedly,\n"+
		"To keep the horsemen off from breaking in.\n"+
		"More than three hours the fight continued;\n"+
		"Where valiant Talbot above human thought\n"+
		"Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:\n"+
		"Hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him;\n"+
		"Here, there, and every where, enraged he flew:\n"+
		"The French exclaim'd, the devil was in arms;\n"+
		"All the whole army stood agazed on him:\n"+
		"His soldiers spying his undaunted spirit\n"+
		"A Talbot! a Talbot! cried out amain\n"+
		"And rush'd into the bowels of the battle.\n"+
		"Here had the conquest fully been seal'd up,\n"+
		"If Sir John Fastolfe had not play'd the coward:\n"+
		"He, being in the vaward, placed behind\n"+
		"With purpose to relieve and follow them,\n"+
		"Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke.\n"+
		"Hence grew the general wreck and massacre;\n"+
		"Enclosed were they with their enemies:\n"+
		"A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin's grace,\n"+
		"Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back,\n"+
		"Whom all France with their chief assembled strength\n"+
		"Durst not presume to look once in the face.\n"+
		"BEDFORD\n"+
		"Is Talbot slain? then I will slay myself,\n"+
		"For living idly here in pomp and ease,\n"+
		"Whilst such a worthy leader, wanting aid,\n"+
		"Unto his dastard foemen is betray'd.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"O no, he lives; but is took prisoner,\n"+
		"And Lord Scales with him and Lord Hungerford:\n"+
		"Most of the rest slaughter'd or took likewise.\n"+
		"BEDFORD\n"+
		"His ransom there is none but I shall pay:\n"+
		"I'll hale the Dauphin headlong from his throne:\n"+
		"His crown shall be the ransom of my friend;\n"+
		"Four of their lords I'll change for one of ours.\n"+
		"Farewell, my masters; to my task will I;\n"+
		"Bonfires in France forthwith I am to make,\n"+
		"To keep our great Saint George's feast withal:\n"+
		"Ten thousand soldiers with me I will take,\n"+
		"Whose bloody deeds shall make all Europe quake.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"So you had need; for Orleans is besieged;\n"+
		"The English army is grown weak and faint:\n"+
		"The Earl of Salisbury craveth supply,\n"+
		"And hardly keeps his men from mutiny,\n"+
		"Since they, so few, watch such a multitude.\n"+
		"EXETER\n"+
		"Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,\n"+
		"Either to quell the Dauphin utterly,\n"+
		"Or bring him in obedience to your yoke.\n"+
		"BEDFORD\n"+
		"I do remember it; and here take my leave,\n"+
		"To go about my preparation.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"I'll to the Tower with all the haste I can,\n"+
		"To view the artillery and munition;\n"+
		"And then I will proclaim young Henry king.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"EXETER\n"+
		"To Eltham will I, where the young king is,\n"+
		"Being ordain'd his special governor,\n"+
		"And for his safety there I'll best devise.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"BISHOP\n"+
		"OF WINCHESTER\n"+
		"Each hath his place and function to attend:\n"+
		"I am left out; for me nothing remains.\n"+
		"But long I will not be Jack out of office:\n"+
		"The king from Eltham I intend to steal\n"+
		"And sit at chiefest stern of public weal.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. France. Before Orleans.\n"+
		"Sound a flourish. Enter CHARLES, ALENCON, and REIGNIER, marching with drum and Soldiers\n"+
		"CHARLES\n"+
		"Mars his true moving, even as in the heavens\n"+
		"So in the earth, to this day is not known:\n"+
		"Late did he shine upon the English side;\n"+
		"Now we are victors; upon us he smiles.\n"+
		"What towns of any moment but we have?\n"+
		"At pleasure here we lie near Orleans;\n"+
		"Otherwhiles the famish'd English, like pale ghosts,\n"+
		"Faintly besiege us one hour in a month.\n"+
		"ALENCON\n"+
		"They want their porridge and their fat bull-beeves:\n"+
		"Either they must be dieted like mules\n"+
		"And have their provender tied to their mouths\n"+
		"Or piteous they will look, like drowned mice.\n"+
		"REIGNIER\n"+
		"Let's raise the siege: why live we idly here?\n"+
		"Talbot is taken, whom we wont to fear:\n"+
		"Remaineth none but mad-brain'd Salisbury;\n"+
		"And he may well in fretting spend his gall,\n"+
		"Nor men nor money hath he to make war.\n"+
		"CHARLES\n"+
		"Sound, sound alarum! we will rush on them.\n"+
		"Now for the honour of the forlorn French!\n"+
		"Him I forgive my death that killeth me\n"+
		"When he sees me go back one foot or fly.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"Here alarum; they are beaten back by the English with great loss. Re-enter CHARLES, ALENCON, and REIGNIER\n"+
		"CHARLES\n"+
		"Who ever saw the like? what men have I!\n"+
		"Dogs! cowards! dastards! I would ne'er have fled,\n"+
		"But that they left me 'midst my enemies.\n"+
		"REIGNIER\n"+
		"Salisbury is a desperate homicide;\n"+
		"He fighteth as one weary of his life.\n"+
		"The other lords, like lions wanting food,\n"+
		"Do rush upon us as their hungry prey.\n"+
		"ALENCON\n"+
		"Froissart, a countryman of ours, records,\n"+
		"England all Olivers and Rowlands bred,\n"+
		"During the time Edward the Third did reign.\n"+
		"More truly now may this be verified;\n"+
		"For none but Samsons and Goliases\n"+
		"It sendeth forth to skirmish. One to ten!\n"+
		"Lean, raw-boned rascals! who would e'er suppose\n"+
		"They had such courage and audacity?\n"+
		"CHARLES\n"+
		"Let's leave this town; for they are hare-brain'd slaves,\n"+
		"And hunger will enforce them to be more eager:\n"+
		"Of old I know them; rather with their teeth\n"+
		"The walls they'll tear down than forsake the siege.\n"+
		"REIGNIER\n"+
		"I think, by some odd gimmors or device\n"+
		"Their arms are set like clocks, stiff to strike on;\n"+
		"Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do.\n"+
		"By my consent, we'll even let them alone.\n"+
		"ALENCON\n"+
		"Be it so.\n"+
		"Enter the BASTARD OF ORLEANS\n"+
		"BASTARD OF ORLEANS\n"+
		"Where's the Prince Dauphin? I have news for him.\n"+
		"CHARLES\n"+
		"Bastard of Orleans, thrice welcome to us.\n"+
		"BASTARD OF ORLEANS\n"+
		"Methinks your looks are sad, your cheer appall'd:\n"+
		"Hath the late overthrow wrought this offence?\n"+
		"Be not dismay'd, for succor is at hand:\n"+
		"A holy maid hither with me I bring,\n"+
		"Which by a vision sent to her from heaven\n"+
		"Ordained is to raise this tedious siege\n"+
		"And drive the English forth the bounds of France.\n"+
		"The spirit of deep prophecy she hath,\n"+
		"Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:\n"+
		"What's past and what's to come she can descry.\n"+
		"Speak, shall I call her in? Believe my words,\n"+
		"For they are certain and unfallible.\n"+
		"CHARLES\n"+
		"Go, call her in.\n"+
		"Exit BASTARD OF ORLEANS\n"+
		"But first, to try her skill,\n"+
		"Reignier, stand thou as Dauphin in my place:\n"+
		"Question her proudly; let thy looks be stern:\n"+
		"By this means shall we sound what skill she hath.\n"+
		"Re-enter the BASTARD OF ORLEANS, with JOAN LA PUCELLE\n"+
		"REIGNIER\n"+
		"Fair maid, is't thou wilt do these wondrous feats?\n"+
		"JOAN LA PUCELLE\n"+
		"Reignier, is't thou that thinkest to beguile me?\n"+
		"Where is the Dauphin? Come, come from behind;\n"+
		"I know thee well, though never seen before.\n"+
		"Be not amazed, there's nothing hid from me:\n"+
		"In private will I talk with thee apart.\n"+
		"Stand back, you lords, and give us leave awhile.\n"+
		"REIGNIER\n"+
		"She takes upon her bravely at first dash.\n"+
		"JOAN LA PUCELLE\n"+
		"Dauphin, I am by birth a shepherd's daughter,\n"+
		"My wit untrain'd in any kind of art.\n"+
		"Heaven and our Lady gracious hath it pleased\n"+
		"To shine on my contemptible estate:\n"+
		"Lo, whilst I waited on my tender lambs,\n"+
		"And to sun's parching heat display'd my cheeks,\n"+
		"God's mother deigned to appear to me\n"+
		"And in a vision full of majesty\n"+
		"Will'd me to leave my base vocation\n"+
		"And free my country from calamity:\n"+
		"Her aid she promised and assured success:\n"+
		"In complete glory she reveal'd herself;\n"+
		"And, whereas I was black and swart before,\n"+
		"With those clear rays which she infused on me\n"+
		"That beauty am I bless'd with which you see.\n"+
		"Ask me what question thou canst possible,\n"+
		"And I will answer unpremeditated:\n"+
		"My courage try by combat, if thou darest,\n"+
		"And thou shalt find that I exceed my sex.\n"+
		"Resolve on this, thou shalt be fortunate,\n"+
		"If thou receive me for thy warlike mate.\n"+
		"CHARLES\n"+
		"Thou hast astonish'd me with thy high terms:\n"+
		"Only this proof I'll of thy valour make,\n"+
		"In single combat thou shalt buckle with me,\n"+
		"And if thou vanquishest, thy words are true;\n"+
		"Otherwise I renounce all confidence.\n"+
		"JOAN LA PUCELLE\n"+
		"I am prepared: here is my keen-edged sword,\n"+
		"Deck'd with five flower-de-luces on each side;\n"+
		"The which at Touraine, in Saint Katharine's\n"+
		"churchyard,\n"+
		"Out of a great deal of old iron I chose forth.\n"+
		"CHARLES\n"+
		"Then come, o' God's name; I fear no woman.\n"+
		"JOAN LA PUCELLE\n"+
		"And while I live, I'll ne'er fly from a man.\n"+
		"Here they fight, and JOAN LA PUCELLE overcomes\n"+
		"CHARLES\n"+
		"Stay, stay thy hands! thou art an Amazon\n"+
		"And fightest with the sword of Deborah.\n"+
		"JOAN LA PUCELLE\n"+
		"Christ's mother helps me, else I were too weak.\n"+
		"CHARLES\n"+
		"Whoe'er helps thee, 'tis thou that must help me:\n"+
		"Impatiently I burn with thy desire;\n"+
		"My heart and hands thou hast at once subdued.\n"+
		"Excellent Pucelle, if thy name be so,\n"+
		"Let me thy servant and not sovereign be:\n"+
		"'Tis the French Dauphin sueth to thee thus.\n"+
		"JOAN LA PUCELLE\n"+
		"I must not yield to any rites of love,\n"+
		"For my profession's sacred from above:\n"+
		"When I have chased all thy foes from hence,\n"+
		"Then will I think upon a recompense.\n"+
		"CHARLES\n"+
		"Meantime look gracious on thy prostrate thrall.\n"+
		"REIGNIER\n"+
		"My lord, methinks, is very long in talk.\n"+
		"ALENCON\n"+
		"Doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock;\n"+
		"Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.\n"+
		"REIGNIER\n"+
		"Shall we disturb him, since he keeps no mean?\n"+
		"ALENCON\n"+
		"He may mean more than we poor men do know:\n"+
		"These women are shrewd tempters with their tongues.\n"+
		"REIGNIER\n"+
		"My lord, where are you? what devise you on?\n"+
		"Shall we give over Orleans, or no?\n"+
		"JOAN LA PUCELLE\n"+
		"Why, no, I say, distrustful recreants!\n"+
		"Fight till the last gasp; I will be your guard.\n"+
		"CHARLES\n"+
		"What she says I'll confirm: we'll fight it out.\n"+
		"JOAN LA PUCELLE\n"+
		"Assign'd am I to be the English scourge.\n"+
		"This night the siege assuredly I'll raise:\n"+
		"Expect Saint Martin's summer, halcyon days,\n"+
		"Since I have entered into these wars.\n"+
		"Glory is like a circle in the water,\n"+
		"Which never ceaseth to enlarge itself\n"+
		"Till by broad spreading it disperse to nought.\n"+
		"With Henry's death the English circle ends;\n"+
		"Dispersed are the glories it included.\n"+
		"Now am I like that proud insulting ship\n"+
		"Which Caesar and his fortune bare at once.\n"+
		"CHARLES\n"+
		"Was Mahomet inspired with a dove?\n"+
		"Thou with an eagle art inspired then.\n"+
		"Helen, the mother of great Constantine,\n"+
		"Nor yet Saint Philip's daughters, were like thee.\n"+
		"Bright star of Venus, fall'n down on the earth,\n"+
		"How may I reverently worship thee enough?\n"+
		"ALENCON\n"+
		"Leave off delays, and let us raise the siege.\n"+
		"REIGNIER\n"+
		"Woman, do what thou canst to save our honours;\n"+
		"Drive them from Orleans and be immortalized.\n"+
		"CHARLES\n"+
		"Presently we'll try: come, let's away about it:\n"+
		"No prophet will I trust, if she prove false.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. London. Before the Tower.\n"+
		"Enter GLOUCESTER, with his Serving-men in blue coats\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"I am come to survey the Tower this day:\n"+
		"Since Henry's death, I fear, there is conveyance.\n"+
		"Where be these warders, that they wait not here?\n"+
		"Open the gates; 'tis Gloucester that calls.\n"+
		"First Warder\n"+
		"[Within] Who's there that knocks so imperiously?\n"+
		"First Serving-Man It is the noble Duke of Gloucester.\n"+
		"Second Warder\n"+
		"[Within] Whoe'er he be, you may not be let in.\n"+
		"First Serving-Man Villains, answer you so the lord protector?\n"+
		"First Warder\n"+
		"[Within] The Lord protect him! so we answer him:\n"+
		"We do no otherwise than we are will'd.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Who willed you? or whose will stands but mine?\n"+
		"There's none protector of the realm but I.\n"+
		"Break up the gates, I'll be your warrantize.\n"+
		"Shall I be flouted thus by dunghill grooms?\n"+
		"Gloucester's men rush at the Tower Gates, and WOODVILE the Lieutenant speaks within\n"+
		"WOODVILE\n"+
		"What noise is this? what traitors have we here?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Lieutenant, is it you whose voice I hear?\n"+
		"Open the gates; here's Gloucester that would enter.\n"+
		"WOODVILE\n"+
		"Have patience, noble duke; I may not open;\n"+
		"The Cardinal of Winchester forbids:\n"+
		"From him I have express commandment\n"+
		"That thou nor none of thine shall be let in.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Faint-hearted Woodvile, prizest him 'fore me?\n"+
		"Arrogant Winchester, that haughty prelate,\n"+
		"Whom Henry, our late sovereign, ne'er could brook?\n"+
		"Thou art no friend to God or to the king:\n"+
		"Open the gates, or I'll shut thee out shortly.\n"+
		"Serving-Men Open the gates unto the lord protector,\n"+
		"Or we'll burst them open, if that you come not quickly.\n"+
		"Enter to the Protector at the Tower Gates BISHOP OF WINCHESTER and his men in tawny coats\n"+
		"BISHOP\n"+
		"OF WINCHESTER\n"+
		"How now, ambitious Humphry! what means this?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Peel'd priest, dost thou command me to be shut out?\n"+
		"BISHOP\n"+
		"OF WINCHESTER\n"+
		"I do, thou most usurping proditor,\n"+
		"And not protector, of the king or realm.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Stand back, thou manifest conspirator,\n"+
		"Thou that contrivedst to murder our dead lord;\n"+
		"Thou that givest whores indulgences to sin:\n"+
		"I'll canvass thee in thy broad cardinal's hat,\n"+
		"If thou proceed in this thy insolence.\n"+
		"BISHOP\n"+
		"OF WINCHESTER\n"+
		"Nay, stand thou back, I will not budge a foot:\n"+
		"This be Damascus, be thou cursed Cain,\n"+
		"To slay thy brother Abel, if thou wilt.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"I will not slay thee, but I'll drive thee back:\n"+
		"Thy scarlet robes as a child's bearing-cloth\n"+
		"I'll use to carry thee out of this place.\n"+
		"BISHOP\n"+
		"OF WINCHESTER\n"+
		"Do what thou darest; I beard thee to thy face.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"What! am I dared and bearded to my face?\n"+
		"Draw, men, for all this privileged place;\n"+
		"Blue coats to tawny coats. Priest, beware your beard,\n"+
		"I mean to tug it and to cuff you soundly:\n"+
		"Under my feet I stamp thy cardinal's hat:\n"+
		"In spite of pope or dignities of church,\n"+
		"Here by the cheeks I'll drag thee up and down.\n"+
		"BISHOP\n"+
		"OF WINCHESTER\n"+
		"Gloucester, thou wilt answer this before the pope.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Winchester goose, I cry, a rope! a rope!\n"+
		"Now beat them hence; why do you let them stay?\n"+
		"Thee I'll chase hence, thou wolf in sheep's array.\n"+
		"Out, tawny coats! out, scarlet hypocrite!\n"+
		"Here GLOUCESTER's men beat out BISHOP OF WINCHESTER's men, and enter in the hurly- burly the Mayor of London and his Officers\n"+
		"Mayor\n"+
		"Fie, lords! that you, being supreme magistrates,\n"+
		"Thus contumeliously should break the peace!\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Peace, mayor! thou know'st little of my wrongs:\n"+
		"Here's Beaufort, that regards nor God nor king,\n"+
		"Hath here distrain'd the Tower to his use.\n"+
		"BISHOP\n"+
		"OF WINCHESTER\n"+
		"Here's Gloucester, a foe to citizens,\n"+
		"One that still motions war and never peace,\n"+
		"O'ercharging your free purses with large fines,\n"+
		"That seeks to overthrow religion,\n"+
		"Because he is protector of the realm,\n"+
		"And would have armour here out of the Tower,\n"+
		"To crown himself king and suppress the prince.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"I will not answer thee with words, but blows.\n"+
		"Here they skirmish again\n"+
		"Mayor\n"+
		"Naught rests for me in this tumultuous strife\n"+
		"But to make open proclamation:\n"+
		"Come, officer; as loud as e'er thou canst,\n"+
		"Cry.\n"+
		"Officer\n"+
		"All manner of men assembled here in arms this day\n"+
		"against God's peace and the king's, we charge and\n"+
		"command you, in his highness' name, to repair to\n"+
		"your several dwelling-places; and not to wear,\n"+
		"handle, or use any sword, weapon, or dagger,\n"+
		"henceforward, upon pain of death.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Cardinal, I'll be no breaker of the law:\n"+
		"But we shall meet, and break our minds at large.\n"+
		"BISHOP\n"+
		"OF WINCHESTER\n"+
		"Gloucester, we will meet; to thy cost, be sure:\n"+
		"Thy heart-blood I will have for this day's work.\n"+
		"Mayor\n"+
		"I'll call for clubs, if you will not away.\n"+
		"This cardinal's more haughty than the devil.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Mayor, farewell: thou dost but what thou mayst.\n"+
		"BISHOP\n"+
		"OF WINCHESTER\n"+
		"Abominable Gloucester, guard thy head;\n"+
		"For I intend to have it ere long.\n"+
		"Exeunt, severally, GLOUCESTER and BISHOP OF WINCHESTER with their Serving-men\n"+
		"Mayor\n"+
		"See the coast clear'd, and then we will depart.\n"+
		"Good God, these nobles should such stomachs bear!\n"+
		"I myself fight not once in forty year.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV. Orleans.\n"+
		"Enter, on the walls, a Master Gunner and his Boy\n"+
		"Master-Gunner Sirrah, thou know'st how Orleans is besieged,\n"+
		"And how the English have the suburbs won.\n"+
		"Boy\n"+
		"Father, I know; and oft have shot at them,\n"+
		"Howe'er unfortunate I miss'd my aim.\n"+
		"Master-Gunner But now thou shalt not. Be thou ruled by me:\n"+
		"Chief master-gunner am I of this town;\n"+
		"Something I must do to procure me grace.\n"+
		"The prince's espials have informed me\n"+
		"How the English, in the suburbs close intrench'd,\n"+
		"Wont, through a secret grate of iron bars\n"+
		"In yonder tower, to overpeer the city,\n"+
		"And thence discover how with most advantage\n"+
		"They may vex us with shot, or with assault.\n"+
		"To intercept this inconvenience,\n"+
		"A piece of ordnance 'gainst it I have placed;\n"+
		"And even these three days have I watch'd,\n"+
		"If I could see them.\n"+
		"Now do thou watch, for I can stay no longer.\n"+
		"If thou spy'st any, run and bring me word;\n"+
		"And thou shalt find me at the governor's.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"Boy\n"+
		"Father, I warrant you; take you no care;\n"+
		"I'll never trouble you, if I may spy them.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"Enter, on the turrets, SALISBURY and TALBOT, GLANSDALE, GARGRAVE, and others\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"Talbot, my life, my joy, again return'd!\n"+
		"How wert thou handled being prisoner?\n"+
		"Or by what means got'st thou to be released?\n"+
		"Discourse, I prithee, on this turret's top.\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"The Duke of Bedford had a prisoner\n"+
		"Call'd the brave Lord Ponton de Santrailles;\n"+
		"For him was I exchanged and ransomed.\n"+
		"But with a baser man of arms by far\n"+
		"Once in contempt they would have barter'd me:\n"+
		"Which I, disdaining, scorn'd; and craved death,\n"+
		"Rather than I would be so vile esteem'd.\n"+
		"In fine, redeem'd I was as I desired.\n"+
		"But, O! the treacherous Fastolfe wounds my heart,\n"+
		"Whom with my bare fists I would execute,\n"+
		"If I now had him brought into my power.\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"Yet tell'st thou not how thou wert entertain'd.\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"With scoffs and scorns and contumelious taunts.\n"+
		"In open market-place produced they me,\n"+
		"To be a public spectacle to all:\n"+
		"Here, said they, is the terror of the French,\n"+
		"The scarecrow that affrights our children so.\n"+
		"Then broke I from the officers that led me,\n"+
		"And with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground,\n"+
		"To hurl at the beholders of my shame:\n"+
		"My grisly countenance made others fly;\n"+
		"None durst come near for fear of sudden death.\n"+
		"In iron walls they deem'd me not secure;\n"+
		"So great fear of my name 'mongst them was spread,\n"+
		"That they supposed I could rend bars of steel,\n"+
		"And spurn in pieces posts of adamant:\n"+
		"Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had,\n"+
		"That walked about me every minute-while;\n"+
		"And if I did but stir out of my bed,\n"+
		"Ready they were to shoot me to the heart.\n"+
		"Enter the Boy with a linstock\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"I grieve to hear what torments you endured,\n"+
		"But we will be revenged sufficiently\n"+
		"Now it is supper-time in Orleans:\n"+
		"Here, through this grate, I count each one\n"+
		"and view the Frenchmen how they fortify:\n"+
		"Let us look in; the sight will much delight thee.\n"+
		"Sir Thomas Gargrave, and Sir William Glansdale,\n"+
		"Let me have your express opinions\n"+
		"Where is best place to make our battery next.\n"+
		"GARGRAVE\n"+
		"I think, at the north gate; for there stand lords.\n"+
		"GLANSDALE\n"+
		"And I, here, at the bulwark of the bridge.\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"For aught I see, this city must be famish'd,\n"+
		"Or with light skirmishes enfeebled.\n"+
		"Here they shoot. SALISBURY and GARGRAVE fall\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"O Lord, have mercy on us, wretched sinners!\n"+
		"GARGRAVE\n"+
		"O Lord, have mercy on me, woful man!\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"What chance is this that suddenly hath cross'd us?\n"+
		"Speak, Salisbury; at least, if thou canst speak:\n"+
		"How farest thou, mirror of all martial men?\n"+
		"One of thy eyes and thy cheek's side struck off!\n"+
		"Accursed tower! accursed fatal hand\n"+
		"That hath contrived this woful tragedy!\n"+
		"In thirteen battles Salisbury o'ercame;\n"+
		"Henry the Fifth he first train'd to the wars;\n"+
		"Whilst any trump did sound, or drum struck up,\n"+
		"His sword did ne'er leave striking in the field.\n"+
		"Yet livest thou, Salisbury? though thy speech doth fail,\n"+
		"One eye thou hast, to look to heaven for grace:\n"+
		"The sun with one eye vieweth all the world.\n"+
		"Heaven, be thou gracious to none alive,\n"+
		"If Salisbury wants mercy at thy hands!\n"+
		"Bear hence his body; I will help to bury it.\n"+
		"Sir Thomas Gargrave, hast thou any life?\n"+
		"Speak unto Talbot; nay, look up to him.\n"+
		"Salisbury, cheer thy spirit with this comfort;\n"+
		"Thou shalt not die whiles--\n"+
		"He beckons with his hand and smiles on me.\n"+
		"As who should say 'When I am dead and gone,\n"+
		"Remember to avenge me on the French.'\n"+
		"Plantagenet, I will; and like thee, Nero,\n"+
		"Play on the lute, beholding the towns burn:\n"+
		"Wretched shall France be only in my name.\n"+
		"Here an alarum, and it thunders and lightens\n"+
		"What stir is this? what tumult's in the heavens?\n"+
		"Whence cometh this alarum and the noise?\n"+
		"Enter a Messenger\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"My lord, my lord, the French have gathered head:\n"+
		"The Dauphin, with one Joan la Pucelle join'd,\n"+
		"A holy prophetess new risen up,\n"+
		"Is come with a great power to raise the siege.\n"+
		"Here SALISBURY lifteth himself up and groans\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"Hear, hear how dying Salisbury doth groan!\n"+
		"It irks his heart he cannot be revenged.\n"+
		"Frenchmen, I'll be a Salisbury to you:\n"+
		"Pucelle or puzzel, dolphin or dogfish,\n"+
		"Your hearts I'll stamp out with my horse's heels,\n"+
		"And make a quagmire of your mingled brains.\n"+
		"Convey me Salisbury into his tent,\n"+
		"And then we'll try what these dastard Frenchmen dare.\n"+
		"Alarum. Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE V. The same.\n"+
		"Here an alarum again: and TALBOT pursueth the DAUPHIN, and driveth him: then enter JOAN LA PUCELLE, driving Englishmen before her, and exit after them then re-enter TALBOT\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"Where is my strength, my valour, and my force?\n"+
		"Our English troops retire, I cannot stay them:\n"+
		"A woman clad in armour chaseth them.\n"+
		"Re-enter JOAN LA PUCELLE\n"+
		"Here, here she comes. I'll have a bout with thee;\n"+
		"Devil or devil's dam, I'll conjure thee:\n"+
		"Blood will I draw on thee, thou art a witch,\n"+
		"And straightway give thy soul to him thou servest.\n"+
		"JOAN LA PUCELLE\n"+
		"Come, come, 'tis only I that must disgrace thee.\n"+
		"Here they fight\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"Heavens, can you suffer hell so to prevail?\n"+
		"My breast I'll burst with straining of my courage\n"+
		"And from my shoulders crack my arms asunder.\n"+
		"But I will chastise this high-minded strumpet.\n"+
		"They fight again\n"+
		"JOAN LA PUCELLE\n"+
		"Talbot, farewell; thy hour is not yet come:\n"+
		"I must go victual Orleans forthwith.\n"+
		"A short alarum; then enter the town with soldiers\n"+
		"O'ertake me, if thou canst; I scorn thy strength.\n"+
		"Go, go, cheer up thy hungry-starved men;\n"+
		"Help Salisbury to make his testament:\n"+
		"This day is ours, as many more shall be.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"My thoughts are whirled like a potter's wheel;\n"+
		"I know not where I am, nor what I do;\n"+
		"A witch, by fear, not force, like Hannibal,\n"+
		"Drives back our troops and conquers as she lists:\n"+
		"So bees with smoke and doves with noisome stench\n"+
		"Are from their hives and houses driven away.\n"+
		"They call'd us for our fierceness English dogs;\n"+
		"Now, like to whelps, we crying run away.\n"+
		"A short alarum\n"+
		"Hark, countrymen! either renew the fight,\n"+
		"Or tear the lions out of England's coat;\n"+
		"Renounce your soil, give sheep in lions' stead:\n"+
		"Sheep run not half so treacherous from the wolf,\n"+
		"Or horse or oxen from the leopard,\n"+
		"As you fly from your oft-subdued slaves.\n"+
		"Alarum. Here another skirmish\n"+
		"It will not be: retire into your trenches:\n"+
		"You all consented unto Salisbury's death,\n"+
		"For none would strike a stroke in his revenge.\n"+
		"Pucelle is enter'd into Orleans,\n"+
		"In spite of us or aught that we could do.\n"+
		"O, would I were to die with Salisbury!\n"+
		"The shame hereof will make me hide my head.\n"+
		"Exit TALBOT. Alarum; retreat; flourish\n"+
		"SCENE VI. The same.\n"+
		"Enter, on the walls, JOAN LA PUCELLE, CHARLES, REIGNIER, ALENCON, and Soldiers\n"+
		"JOAN LA PUCELLE\n"+
		"Advance our waving colours on the walls;\n"+
		"Rescued is Orleans from the English\n"+
		"Thus Joan la Pucelle hath perform'd her word.\n"+
		"CHARLES\n"+
		"Divinest creature, Astraea's daughter,\n"+
		"How shall I honour thee for this success?\n"+
		"Thy promises are like Adonis' gardens\n"+
		"That one day bloom'd and fruitful were the next.\n"+
		"France, triumph in thy glorious prophetess!\n"+
		"Recover'd is the town of Orleans:\n"+
		"More blessed hap did ne'er befall our state.\n"+
		"REIGNIER\n"+
		"Why ring not out the bells aloud throughout the town?\n"+
		"Dauphin, command the citizens make bonfires\n"+
		"And feast and banquet in the open streets,\n"+
		"To celebrate the joy that God hath given us.\n"+
		"ALENCON\n"+
		"All France will be replete with mirth and joy,\n"+
		"When they shall hear how we have play'd the men.\n"+
		"CHARLES\n"+
		"'Tis Joan, not we, by whom the day is won;\n"+
		"For which I will divide my crown with her,\n"+
		"And all the priests and friars in my realm\n"+
		"Shall in procession sing her endless praise.\n"+
		"A statelier pyramis to her I'll rear\n"+
		"Than Rhodope's or Memphis' ever was:\n"+
		"In memory of her when she is dead,\n"+
		"Her ashes, in an urn more precious\n"+
		"Than the rich-jewel'd of Darius,\n"+
		"Transported shall be at high festivals\n"+
		"Before the kings and queens of France.\n"+
		"No longer on Saint Denis will we cry,\n"+
		"But Joan la Pucelle shall be France's saint.\n"+
		"Come in, and let us banquet royally,\n"+
		"After this golden day of victory.\n"+
		"Flourish. Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT II\n"+
		"SCENE I. Before Orleans.\n"+
		"Enter a Sergeant of a band with two Sentinels\n"+
		"Sergeant\n"+
		"Sirs, take your places and be vigilant:\n"+
		"If any noise or soldier you perceive\n"+
		"Near to the walls, by some apparent sign\n"+
		"Let us have knowledge at the court of guard.\n"+
		"First Sentinel\n"+
		"Sergeant, you shall.\n"+
		"Exit Sergeant\n"+
		"Thus are poor servitors,\n"+
		"When others sleep upon their quiet beds,\n"+
		"Constrain'd to watch in darkness, rain and cold.\n"+
		"Enter TALBOT, BEDFORD, BURGUNDY, and Forces, with scaling-ladders, their drums beating a dead march\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"Lord Regent, and redoubted Burgundy,\n"+
		"By whose approach the regions of Artois,\n"+
		"Wallon and Picardy are friends to us,\n"+
		"This happy night the Frenchmen are secure,\n"+
		"Having all day caroused and banqueted:\n"+
		"Embrace we then this opportunity\n"+
		"As fitting best to quittance their deceit\n"+
		"Contrived by art and baleful sorcery.\n"+
		"BEDFORD\n"+
		"Coward of France! how much he wrongs his fame,\n"+
		"Despairing of his own arm's fortitude,\n"+
		"To join with witches and the help of hell!\n"+
		"BURGUNDY\n"+
		"Traitors have never other company.\n"+
		"But what's that Pucelle whom they term so pure?\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"A maid, they say.\n"+
		"BEDFORD\n"+
		"A maid! and be so martial!\n"+
		"BURGUNDY\n"+
		"Pray God she prove not masculine ere long,\n"+
		"If underneath the standard of the French\n"+
		"She carry armour as she hath begun.\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"Well, let them practise and converse with spirits:\n"+
		"God is our fortress, in whose conquering name\n"+
		"Let us resolve to scale their flinty bulwarks.\n"+
		"BEDFORD\n"+
		"Ascend, brave Talbot; we will follow thee.\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"Not all together: better far, I guess,\n"+
		"That we do make our entrance several ways;\n"+
		"That, if it chance the one of us do fail,\n"+
		"The other yet may rise against their force.\n"+
		"BEDFORD\n"+
		"Agreed: I'll to yond corner.\n"+
		"BURGUNDY\n"+
		"And I to this.\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"And here will Talbot mount, or make his grave.\n"+
		"Now, Salisbury, for thee, and for the right\n"+
		"Of English Henry, shall this night appear\n"+
		"How much in duty I am bound to both.\n"+
		"Sentinels\n"+
		"Arm! arm! the enemy doth make assault!\n"+
		"Cry: 'St. George,' 'A Talbot.'\n"+
		"The French leap over the walls in their shirts. Enter, several ways, the BASTARD OF ORLEANS, ALENCON, and REIGNIER, half ready, and half unready\n"+
		"ALENCON\n"+
		"How now, my lords! what, all unready so?\n"+
		"BASTARD OF ORLEANS\n"+
		"Unready! ay, and glad we 'scaped so well.\n"+
		"REIGNIER\n"+
		"'Twas time, I trow, to wake and leave our beds,\n"+
		"Hearing alarums at our chamber-doors.\n"+
		"ALENCON\n"+
		"Of all exploits since first I follow'd arms,\n"+
		"Ne'er heard I of a warlike enterprise\n"+
		"More venturous or desperate than this.\n"+
		"BASTARD OF ORLEANS\n"+
		"I think this Talbot be a fiend of hell.\n"+
		"REIGNIER\n"+
		"If not of hell, the heavens, sure, favour him.\n"+
		"ALENCON\n"+
		"Here cometh Charles: I marvel how he sped.\n"+
		"BASTARD OF ORLEANS\n"+
		"Tut, holy Joan was his defensive guard.\n"+
		"Enter CHARLES and JOAN LA PUCELLE\n"+
		"CHARLES\n"+
		"Is this thy cunning, thou deceitful dame?\n"+
		"Didst thou at first, to flatter us withal,\n"+
		"Make us partakers of a little gain,\n"+
		"That now our loss might be ten times so much?\n"+
		"JOAN LA PUCELLE\n"+
		"Wherefore is Charles impatient with his friend!\n"+
		"At all times will you have my power alike?\n"+
		"Sleeping or waking must I still prevail,\n"+
		"Or will you blame and lay the fault on me?\n"+
		"Improvident soldiers! had your watch been good,\n"+
		"This sudden mischief never could have fall'n.\n"+
		"CHARLES\n"+
		"Duke of Alencon, this was your default,\n"+
		"That, being captain of the watch to-night,\n"+
		"Did look no better to that weighty charge.\n"+
		"ALENCON\n"+
		"Had all your quarters been as safely kept\n"+
		"As that whereof I had the government,\n"+
		"We had not been thus shamefully surprised.\n"+
		"BASTARD OF ORLEANS\n"+
		"Mine was secure.\n"+
		"REIGNIER\n"+
		"And so was mine, my lord.\n"+
		"CHARLES\n"+
		"And, for myself, most part of all this night,\n"+
		"Within her quarter and mine own precinct\n"+
		"I was employ'd in passing to and fro,\n"+
		"About relieving of the sentinels:\n"+
		"Then how or which way should they first break in?\n"+
		"JOAN LA PUCELLE\n"+
		"Question, my lords, no further of the case,\n"+
		"How or which way: 'tis sure they found some place\n"+
		"But weakly guarded, where the breach was made.\n"+
		"And now there rests no other shift but this;\n"+
		"To gather our soldiers, scatter'd and dispersed,\n"+
		"And lay new platforms to endamage them.\n"+
		"Alarum. Enter an English Soldier, crying 'A Talbot! a Talbot!' They fly, leaving their clothes behind\n"+
		"Soldier\n"+
		"I'll be so bold to take what they have left.\n"+
		"The cry of Talbot serves me for a sword;\n"+
		"For I have loaden me with many spoils,\n"+
		"Using no other weapon but his name.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE II. Orleans. Within the town.\n"+
		"Enter TALBOT, BEDFORD, BURGUNDY, a Captain, and others\n"+
		"BEDFORD\n"+
		"The day begins to break, and night is fled,\n"+
		"Whose pitchy mantle over-veil'd the earth.\n"+
		"Here sound retreat, and cease our hot pursuit.\n"+
		"Retreat sounded\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"Bring forth the body of old Salisbury,\n"+
		"And here advance it in the market-place,\n"+
		"The middle centre of this cursed town.\n"+
		"Now have I paid my vow unto his soul;\n"+
		"For every drop of blood was drawn from him,\n"+
		"There hath at least five Frenchmen died tonight.\n"+
		"And that hereafter ages may behold\n"+
		"What ruin happen'd in revenge of him,\n"+
		"Within their chiefest temple I'll erect\n"+
		"A tomb, wherein his corpse shall be interr'd:\n"+
		"Upon the which, that every one may read,\n"+
		"Shall be engraved the sack of Orleans,\n"+
		"The treacherous manner of his mournful death\n"+
		"And what a terror he had been to France.\n"+
		"But, lords, in all our bloody massacre,\n"+
		"I muse we met not with the Dauphin's grace,\n"+
		"His new-come champion, virtuous Joan of Arc,\n"+
		"Nor any of his false confederates.\n"+
		"BEDFORD\n"+
		"'Tis thought, Lord Talbot, when the fight began,\n"+
		"Roused on the sudden from their drowsy beds,\n"+
		"They did amongst the troops of armed men\n"+
		"Leap o'er the walls for refuge in the field.\n"+
		"BURGUNDY\n"+
		"Myself, as far as I could well discern\n"+
		"For smoke and dusky vapours of the night,\n"+
		"Am sure I scared the Dauphin and his trull,\n"+
		"When arm in arm they both came swiftly running,\n"+
		"Like to a pair of loving turtle-doves\n"+
		"That could not live asunder day or night.\n"+
		"After that things are set in order here,\n"+
		"We'll follow them with all the power we have.\n"+
		"Enter a Messenger\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"All hail, my lords! which of this princely train\n"+
		"Call ye the warlike Talbot, for his acts\n"+
		"So much applauded through the realm of France?\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"Here is the Talbot: who would speak with him?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"The virtuous lady, Countess of Auvergne,\n"+
		"With modesty admiring thy renown,\n"+
		"By me entreats, great lord, thou wouldst vouchsafe\n"+
		"To visit her poor castle where she lies,\n"+
		"That she may boast she hath beheld the man\n"+
		"Whose glory fills the world with loud report.\n"+
		"BURGUNDY\n"+
		"Is it even so? Nay, then, I see our wars\n"+
		"Will turn unto a peaceful comic sport,\n"+
		"When ladies crave to be encounter'd with.\n"+
		"You may not, my lord, despise her gentle suit.\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"Ne'er trust me then; for when a world of men\n"+
		"Could not prevail with all their oratory,\n"+
		"Yet hath a woman's kindness over-ruled:\n"+
		"And therefore tell her I return great thanks,\n"+
		"And in submission will attend on her.\n"+
		"Will not your honours bear me company?\n"+
		"BEDFORD\n"+
		"No, truly; it is more than manners will:\n"+
		"And I have heard it said, unbidden guests\n"+
		"Are often welcomest when they are gone.\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"Well then, alone, since there's no remedy,\n"+
		"I mean to prove this lady's courtesy.\n"+
		"Come hither, captain.\n"+
		"Whispers\n"+
		"You perceive my mind?\n"+
		"Captain\n"+
		"I do, my lord, and mean accordingly.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. Auvergne. The COUNTESS's castle.\n"+
		"Enter the COUNTESS and her Porter\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"OF AUVERGNE\n"+
		"Porter, remember what I gave in charge;\n"+
		"And when you have done so, bring the keys to me.\n"+
		"Porter\n"+
		"Madam, I will.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"OF AUVERGNE\n"+
		"The plot is laid: if all things fall out right,\n"+
		"I shall as famous be by this exploit\n"+
		"As Scythian Tomyris by Cyrus' death.\n"+
		"Great is the rumor of this dreadful knight,\n"+
		"And his achievements of no less account:\n"+
		"Fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears,\n"+
		"To give their censure of these rare reports.\n"+
		"Enter Messenger and TALBOT\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Madam,\n"+
		"According as your ladyship desired,\n"+
		"By message craved, so is Lord Talbot come.\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"OF AUVERGNE\n"+
		"And he is welcome. What! is this the man?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Madam, it is.\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"OF AUVERGNE\n"+
		"Is this the scourge of France?\n"+
		"Is this the Talbot, so much fear'd abroad\n"+
		"That with his name the mothers still their babes?\n"+
		"I see report is fabulous and false:\n"+
		"I thought I should have seen some Hercules,\n"+
		"A second Hector, for his grim aspect,\n"+
		"And large proportion of his strong-knit limbs.\n"+
		"Alas, this is a child, a silly dwarf!\n"+
		"It cannot be this weak and writhled shrimp\n"+
		"Should strike such terror to his enemies.\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"Madam, I have been bold to trouble you;\n"+
		"But since your ladyship is not at leisure,\n"+
		"I'll sort some other time to visit you.\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"OF AUVERGNE\n"+
		"What means he now? Go ask him whither he goes.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Stay, my Lord Talbot; for my lady craves\n"+
		"To know the cause of your abrupt departure.\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"Marry, for that she's in a wrong belief,\n"+
		"I go to certify her Talbot's here.\n"+
		"Re-enter Porter with keys\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"OF AUVERGNE\n"+
		"If thou be he, then art thou prisoner.\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"Prisoner! to whom?\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"OF AUVERGNE\n"+
		"To me, blood-thirsty lord;\n"+
		"And for that cause I trained thee to my house.\n"+
		"Long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me,\n"+
		"For in my gallery thy picture hangs:\n"+
		"But now the substance shall endure the like,\n"+
		"And I will chain these legs and arms of thine,\n"+
		"That hast by tyranny these many years\n"+
		"Wasted our country, slain our citizens\n"+
		"And sent our sons and husbands captivate.\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"Ha, ha, ha!\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"OF AUVERGNE\n"+
		"Laughest thou, wretch? thy mirth shall turn to moan.\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"I laugh to see your ladyship so fond\n"+
		"To think that you have aught but Talbot's shadow\n"+
		"Whereon to practise your severity.\n"+

		"I am indeed.\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"OF AUVERGNE\n"+
		"Then have I substance too.\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"No, no, I am but shadow of myself:\n"+
		"You are deceived, my substance is not here;\n"+
		"For what you see is but the smallest part\n"+
		"And least proportion of humanity:\n"+
		"I tell you, madam, were the whole frame here,\n"+
		"It is of such a spacious lofty pitch,\n"+
		"Your roof were not sufficient to contain't.\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"OF AUVERGNE\n"+
		"This is a riddling merchant for the nonce;\n"+
		"He will be here, and yet he is not here:\n"+
		"How can these contrarieties agree?\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"That will I show you presently.\n"+
		"Winds his horn. Drums strike up: a peal of ordnance. Enter soldiers\n"+
		"How say you, madam? are you now persuaded\n"+
		"That Talbot is but shadow of himself?\n"+
		"These are his substance, sinews, arms and strength,\n"+
		"With which he yoketh your rebellious necks,\n"+
		"Razeth your cities and subverts your towns\n"+
		"And in a moment makes them desolate.\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+

		"Be not dismay'd, fair lady; nor misconstrue\n"+
		"The mind of Talbot, as you did mistake\n"+

		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV. London. The Temple-garden.\n"+
		"Enter the Earls of SOMERSET, SUFFOLK, and WARWICK; RICHARD PLANTAGENET, VERNON, and another Lawyer\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"PLANTAGENET\n"+
		"Great lords and gentlemen, what means this silence?\n"+
		"Dare no man answer in a case of truth?\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Within the Temple-hall we were too loud;\n"+
		"The garden here is more convenient.\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"PLANTAGENET\n"+
		"Then say at once if I maintain'd the truth;\n"+
		"Or else was wrangling Somerset in the error?\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Faith, I have been a truant in the law,\n"+
		"And never yet could frame my will to it;\n"+
		"And therefore frame the law unto my will.\n"+
		"SOMERSET\n"+
		"Judge you, my Lord of Warwick, then, between us.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Between two hawks, which flies the higher pitch;\n"+
		"Between two dogs, which hath the deeper mouth;\n"+
		"Between two blades, which bears the better temper:\n"+
		"Between two horses, which doth bear him best;\n"+
		"Between two girls, which hath the merriest eye;\n"+
		"I have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgement;\n"+
		"But in these nice sharp quillets of the law,\n"+
		"Good faith, I am no wiser than a daw.\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"PLANTAGENET\n"+
		"Tut, tut, here is a mannerly forbearance:\n"+
		"The truth appears so naked on my side\n"+
		"That any purblind eye may find it out.\n"+
		"SOMERSET\n"+
		"And on my side it is so well apparell'd,\n"+
		"So clear, so shining and so evident\n"+
		"That it will glimmer through a blind man's eye.\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"PLANTAGENET\n"+
		"Since you are tongue-tied and so loath to speak,\n"+
		"In dumb significants proclaim your thoughts:\n"+
		"Let him that is a true-born gentleman\n"+
		"And stands upon the honour of his birth,\n"+
		"If he suppose that I have pleaded truth,\n"+
		"From off this brier pluck a white rose with me.\n"+
		"SOMERSET\n"+
		"Let him that is no coward nor no flatterer,\n"+
		"But dare maintain the party of the truth,\n"+
		"Pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"I love no colours, and without all colour\n"+
		"Of base insinuating flattery\n"+
		"I pluck this white rose with Plantagenet.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"I pluck this red rose with young Somerset\n"+
		"And say withal I think he held the right.\n"+
		"VERNON\n"+
		"Stay, lords and gentlemen, and pluck no more,\n"+
		"Till you conclude that he upon whose side\n"+
		"The fewest roses are cropp'd from the tree\n"+
		"Shall yield the other in the right opinion.\n"+
		"SOMERSET\n"+
		"Good Master Vernon, it is well objected:\n"+
		"If I have fewest, I subscribe in silence.\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"PLANTAGENET\n"+
		"And I.\n"+
		"VERNON\n"+
		"Then for the truth and plainness of the case.\n"+
		"I pluck this pale and maiden blossom here,\n"+
		"Giving my verdict on the white rose side.\n"+
		"SOMERSET\n"+
		"Prick not your finger as you pluck it off,\n"+
		"Lest bleeding you do paint the white rose red\n"+
		"And fall on my side so, against your will.\n"+
		"VERNON\n"+
		"If I my lord, for my opinion bleed,\n"+
		"Opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt\n"+
		"And keep me on the side where still I am.\n"+
		"SOMERSET\n"+
		"Well, well, come on: who else?\n"+
		"Lawyer\n"+
		"Unless my study and my books be false,\n"+
		"The argument you held was wrong in you:\n"+
		"To SOMERSET\n"+
		"In sign whereof I pluck a white rose too.\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"PLANTAGENET\n"+
		"Now, Somerset, where is your argument?\n"+
		"SOMERSET\n"+
		"Here in my scabbard, meditating that\n"+
		"Shall dye your white rose in a bloody red.\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"PLANTAGENET\n"+
		"Meantime your cheeks do counterfeit our roses;\n"+
		"For pale they look with fear, as witnessing\n"+
		"The truth on our side.\n"+
		"SOMERSET\n"+
		"No, Plantagenet,\n"+
		"'Tis not for fear but anger that thy cheeks\n"+
		"Blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses,\n"+
		"And yet thy tongue will not confess thy error.\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"PLANTAGENET\n"+
		"Hath not thy rose a canker, Somerset?\n"+
		"SOMERSET\n"+
		"Hath not thy rose a thorn, Plantagenet?\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"PLANTAGENET\n"+
		"Ay, sharp and piercing, to maintain his truth;\n"+
		"Whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood.\n"+
		"SOMERSET\n"+
		"Well, I'll find friends to wear my bleeding roses,\n"+
		"That shall maintain what I have said is true,\n"+
		"Where false Plantagenet dare not be seen.\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"PLANTAGENET\n"+
		"Now, by this maiden blossom in my hand,\n"+
		"I scorn thee and thy fashion, peevish boy.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Turn not thy scorns this way, Plantagenet.\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"PLANTAGENET\n"+
		"Proud Pole, I will, and scorn both him and thee.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"I'll turn my part thereof into thy throat.\n"+
		"SOMERSET\n"+
		"Away, away, good William de la Pole!\n"+
		"We grace the yeoman by conversing with him.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Now, by God's will, thou wrong'st him, Somerset;\n"+
		"His grandfather was Lionel Duke of Clarence,\n"+
		"Third son to the third Edward King of England:\n"+
		"Spring crestless yeomen from so deep a root?\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"PLANTAGENET\n"+
		"He bears him on the place's privilege,\n"+
		"Or durst not, for his craven heart, say thus.\n"+
		"SOMERSET\n"+
		"By him that made me, I'll maintain my words\n"+
		"On any plot of ground in Christendom.\n"+
		"Was not thy father, Richard Earl of Cambridge,\n"+
		"For treason executed in our late king's days?\n"+
		"And, by his treason, stand'st not thou attainted,\n"+
		"Corrupted, and exempt from ancient gentry?\n"+
		"His trespass yet lives guilty in thy blood;\n"+
		"And, till thou be restored, thou art a yeoman.\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"PLANTAGENET\n"+
		"My father was attached, not attainted,\n"+
		"Condemn'd to die for treason, but no traitor;\n"+
		"And that I'll prove on better men than Somerset,\n"+
		"Were growing time once ripen'd to my will.\n"+
		"For your partaker Pole and you yourself,\n"+
		"I'll note you in my book of memory,\n"+
		"To scourge you for this apprehension:\n"+
		"Look to it well and say you are well warn'd.\n"+
		"SOMERSET\n"+
		"Ah, thou shalt find us ready for thee still;\n"+
		"And know us by these colours for thy foes,\n"+
		"For these my friends in spite of thee shall wear.\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"PLANTAGENET\n"+
		"And, by my soul, this pale and angry rose,\n"+
		"As cognizance of my blood-drinking hate,\n"+
		"Will I for ever and my faction wear,\n"+
		"Until it wither with me to my grave\n"+
		"Or flourish to the height of my degree.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Go forward and be choked with thy ambition!\n"+
		"And so farewell until I meet thee next.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SOMERSET\n"+
		"Have with thee, Pole. Farewell, ambitious Richard.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"PLANTAGENET\n"+
		"How I am braved and must perforce endure it!\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"This blot that they object against your house\n"+
		"Shall be wiped out in the next parliament\n"+
		"Call'd for the truce of Winchester and Gloucester;\n"+
		"And if thou be not then created York,\n"+
		"I will not live to be accounted Warwick.\n"+
		"Meantime, in signal of my love to thee,\n"+
		"Against proud Somerset and William Pole,\n"+
		"Will I upon thy party wear this rose:\n"+
		"And here I prophesy: this brawl to-day,\n"+
		"Grown to this faction in the Temple-garden,\n"+
		"Shall send between the red rose and the white\n"+
		"A thousand souls to death and deadly night.\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"PLANTAGENET\n"+
		"Good Master Vernon, I am bound to you,\n"+
		"That you on my behalf would pluck a flower.\n"+
		"VERNON\n"+
		"In your behalf still will I wear the same.\n"+
		"Lawyer\n"+
		"And so will I.\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"PLANTAGENET\n"+
		"Thanks, gentle sir.\n"+
		"Come, let us four to dinner: I dare say\n"+
		"This quarrel will drink blood another day.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE V. The Tower of London.\n"+
		"Enter MORTIMER, brought in a chair, and Gaolers\n"+
		"MORTIMER\n"+
		"Kind keepers of my weak decaying age,\n"+
		"Let dying Mortimer here rest himself.\n"+
		"Even like a man new haled from the rack,\n"+
		"So fare my limbs with long imprisonment.\n"+
		"And these grey locks, the pursuivants of death,\n"+
		"Nestor-like aged in an age of care,\n"+
		"Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer.\n"+
		"These eyes, like lamps whose wasting oil is spent,\n"+
		"Wax dim, as drawing to their exigent;\n"+
		"Weak shoulders, overborne with burthening grief,\n"+
		"And pithless arms, like to a wither'd vine\n"+
		"That droops his sapless branches to the ground;\n"+
		"Yet are these feet, whose strengthless stay is numb,\n"+
		"Unable to support this lump of clay,\n"+
		"Swift-winged with desire to get a grave,\n"+
		"As witting I no other comfort have.\n"+
		"But tell me, keeper, will my nephew come?\n"+
		"First Gaoler\n"+
		"Richard Plantagenet, my lord, will come:\n"+
		"We sent unto the Temple, unto his chamber;\n"+
		"And answer was return'd that he will come.\n"+
		"MORTIMER\n"+
		"Enough: my soul shall then be satisfied.\n"+
		"Poor gentleman! his wrong doth equal mine.\n"+
		"Since Henry Monmouth first began to reign,\n"+
		"Before whose glory I was great in arms,\n"+
		"This loathsome sequestration have I had:\n"+
		"And even since then hath Richard been obscured,\n"+
		"Deprived of honour and inheritance.\n"+
		"But now the arbitrator of despairs,\n"+
		"Just death, kind umpire of men's miseries,\n"+
		"With sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence:\n"+
		"I would his troubles likewise were expired,\n"+
		"That so he might recover what was lost.\n"+
		"Enter RICHARD PLANTAGENET\n"+
		"First Gaoler\n"+
		"My lord, your loving nephew now is come.\n"+
		"MORTIMER\n"+
		"Richard Plantagenet, my friend, is he come?\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"PLANTAGENET\n"+
		"Ay, noble uncle, thus ignobly used,\n"+
		"Your nephew, late despised Richard, comes.\n"+
		"MORTIMER\n"+
		"Direct mine arms I may embrace his neck,\n"+
		"And in his bosom spend my latter gasp:\n"+
		"O, tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks,\n"+
		"That I may kindly give one fainting kiss.\n"+
		"And now declare, sweet stem from York's great stock,\n"+
		"Why didst thou say, of late thou wert despised?\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"PLANTAGENET\n"+
		"First, lean thine aged back against mine arm;\n"+
		"And, in that ease, I'll tell thee my disease.\n"+
		"This day, in argument upon a case,\n"+
		"Some words there grew 'twixt Somerset and me;\n"+
		"Among which terms he used his lavish tongue\n"+
		"And did upbraid me with my father's death:\n"+
		"Which obloquy set bars before my tongue,\n"+
		"Else with the like I had requited him.\n"+
		"Therefore, good uncle, for my father's sake,\n"+
		"In honour of a true Plantagenet\n"+
		"And for alliance sake, declare the cause\n"+
		"My father, Earl of Cambridge, lost his head.\n"+
		"MORTIMER\n"+
		"That cause, fair nephew, that imprison'd me\n"+
		"And hath detain'd me all my flowering youth\n"+
		"Within a loathsome dungeon, there to pine,\n"+
		"Was cursed instrument of his decease.\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"PLANTAGENET\n"+
		"Discover more at large what cause that was,\n"+
		"For I am ignorant and cannot guess.\n"+
		"MORTIMER\n"+
		"I will, if that my fading breath permit\n"+
		"And death approach not ere my tale be done.\n"+
		"Henry the Fourth, grandfather to this king,\n"+
		"Deposed his nephew Richard, Edward's son,\n"+
		"The first-begotten and the lawful heir,\n"+
		"Of Edward king, the third of that descent:\n"+
		"During whose reign the Percies of the north,\n"+
		"Finding his usurpation most unjust,\n"+
		"Endeavor'd my advancement to the throne:\n"+
		"The reason moved these warlike lords to this\n"+
		"Was, for that--young King Richard thus removed,\n"+
		"Leaving no heir begotten of his body--\n"+
		"I was the next by birth and parentage;\n"+
		"For by my mother I derived am\n"+
		"From Lionel Duke of Clarence, the third son\n"+
		"To King Edward the Third; whereas he\n"+
		"From John of Gaunt doth bring his pedigree,\n"+
		"Being but fourth of that heroic line.\n"+
		"But mark: as in this haughty attempt\n"+
		"They laboured to plant the rightful heir,\n"+
		"I lost my liberty and they their lives.\n"+
		"Long after this, when Henry the Fifth,\n"+
		"Succeeding his father Bolingbroke, did reign,\n"+
		"Thy father, Earl of Cambridge, then derived\n"+
		"From famous Edmund Langley, Duke of York,\n"+
		"Marrying my sister that thy mother was,\n"+
		"Again in pity of my hard distress\n"+
		"Levied an army, weening to redeem\n"+
		"And have install'd me in the diadem:\n"+
		"But, as the rest, so fell that noble earl\n"+
		"And was beheaded. Thus the Mortimers,\n"+
		"In whom the tide rested, were suppress'd.\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"PLANTAGENET\n"+
		"Of which, my lord, your honour is the last.\n"+
		"MORTIMER\n"+
		"True; and thou seest that I no issue have\n"+
		"And that my fainting words do warrant death;\n"+
		"Thou art my heir; the rest I wish thee gather:\n"+
		"But yet be wary in thy studious care.\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"PLANTAGENET\n"+
		"Thy grave admonishments prevail with me:\n"+
		"But yet, methinks, my father's execution\n"+
		"Was nothing less than bloody tyranny.\n"+
		"MORTIMER\n"+
		"With silence, nephew, be thou politic:\n"+
		"Strong-fixed is the house of Lancaster,\n"+
		"And like a mountain, not to be removed.\n"+
		"But now thy uncle is removing hence:\n"+
		"As princes do their courts, when they are cloy'd\n"+
		"With long continuance in a settled place.\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"PLANTAGENET\n"+
		"O, uncle, would some part of my young years\n"+
		"Might but redeem the passage of your age!\n"+
		"MORTIMER\n"+
		"Thou dost then wrong me, as that slaughterer doth\n"+
		"Which giveth many wounds when one will kill.\n"+
		"Mourn not, except thou sorrow for my good;\n"+
		"Only give order for my funeral:\n"+
		"And so farewell, and fair be all thy hopes\n"+
		"And prosperous be thy life in peace and war!\n"+
		"Dies\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"PLANTAGENET\n"+
		"And peace, no war, befall thy parting soul!\n"+
		"In prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage\n"+
		"And like a hermit overpass'd thy days.\n"+
		"Well, I will lock his counsel in my breast;\n"+
		"And what I do imagine let that rest.\n"+
		"Keepers, convey him hence, and I myself\n"+
		"Will see his burial better than his life.\n"+
		"Exeunt Gaolers, bearing out the body of MORTIMER\n"+
		"Here dies the dusky torch of Mortimer,\n"+
		"Choked with ambition of the meaner sort:\n"+
		"And for those wrongs, those bitter injuries,\n"+
		"Which Somerset hath offer'd to my house:\n"+
		"I doubt not but with honour to redress;\n"+
		"And therefore haste I to the parliament,\n"+
		"Either to be restored to my blood,\n"+
		"Or make my ill the advantage of my good.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"ACT III\n"+
		"SCENE I. London. The Parliament-house.\n"+
		"Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI, EXETER, GLOUCESTER, WARWICK, SOMERSET, and SUFFOLK; the BISHOP OF WINCHESTER, RICHARD PLANTAGENET, and others. GLOUCESTER offers to put up a bill; BISHOP OF WINCHESTER snatches it, and tears it\n"+
		"BISHOP\n"+
		"OF WINCHESTER\n"+
		"Comest thou with deep premeditated lines,\n"+
		"With written pamphlets studiously devised,\n"+
		"Humphrey of Gloucester? If thou canst accuse,\n"+
		"Or aught intend'st to lay unto my charge,\n"+
		"Do it without invention, suddenly;\n"+
		"As I with sudden and extemporal speech\n"+
		"Purpose to answer what thou canst object.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Presumptuous priest! this place commands my patience,\n"+
		"Or thou shouldst find thou hast dishonour'd me.\n"+
		"Think not, although in writing I preferr'd\n"+
		"The manner of thy vile outrageous crimes,\n"+
		"That therefore I have forged, or am not able\n"+
		"Verbatim to rehearse the method of my pen:\n"+
		"No, prelate; such is thy audacious wickedness,\n"+
		"Thy lewd, pestiferous and dissentious pranks,\n"+

		"As well at London bridge as at the Tower.\n"+
		"Beside, I fear me, if thy thoughts were sifted,\n"+
		"The king, thy sovereign, is not quite exempt\n"+
		"From envious malice of thy swelling heart.\n"+
		"BISHOP\n"+
		"OF WINCHESTER\n"+
		"Gloucester, I do defy thee. Lords, vouchsafe\n"+
		"To give me hearing what I shall reply.\n"+
		"If I were covetous, ambitious or perverse,\n"+
		"As he will have me, how am I so poor?\n"+
		"Or how haps it I seek not to advance\n"+
		"Or raise myself, but keep my wonted calling?\n"+
		"And for dissension, who preferreth peace\n"+
		"More than I do?--except I be provoked.\n"+
		"No, my good lords, it is not that offends;\n"+
		"It is not that that hath incensed the duke:\n"+
		"It is, because no one should sway but he;\n"+
		"No one but he should be about the king;\n"+
		"And that engenders thunder in his breast\n"+
		"And makes him roar these accusations forth.\n"+
		"But he shall know I am as good--\n"+

		"As good!\n"+
		"Thou bastard of my grandfather!\n"+
		"BISHOP\n"+
		"OF WINCHESTER\n"+
		"Ay, lordly sir; for what are you, I pray,\n"+

		"Am I not protector, saucy priest?\n"+
		"BISHOP\n"+
		"OF WINCHESTER\n"+

		"Pity the city of London, pity us!\n"+
		"The bishop and the Duke of Gloucester's men,\n"+
		"Forbidden late to carry any weapon,\n"+
		"Have fill'd their pockets full of pebble stones\n"+

		"My sighs and tears and will not once relent?\n"+
		"Who should be pitiful, if you be not?\n"+
		"Or who should study to prefer a peace.\n"+
		"If holy churchmen take delight in broils?\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Yield, my lord protector; yield, Winchester;\n"+
		"Except you mean with obstinate repulse\n"+
		"To slay your sovereign and destroy the realm.\n"+
		"You see what mischief and what murder too\n"+

		"BISHOP\n"+

		"He shall submit, or I will never yield.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Compassion on the king commands me stoop;\n"+
		"Or I would see his heart out, ere the priest\n"+

		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Behold, my Lord of Winchester, the duke\n"+
		"Hath banish'd moody discontented fury,\n"+
		"As by his smoothed brows it doth appear:\n"+
		"Why look you still so stern and tragical?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Here, Winchester, I offer thee my hand.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Fie, uncle Beaufort! I have heard you preach\n"+
		"That malice was a great and grievous sin;\n"+
		"And will not you maintain the thing you teach,\n"+
		"But prove a chief offender in the same?\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Sweet king! the bishop hath a kindly gird.\n"+
		"For shame, my lord of Winchester, relent!\n"+
		"What, shall a child instruct you what to do?\n"+
		"BISHOP\n"+
		"OF WINCHESTER\n"+
		"Well, Duke of Gloucester, I will yield to thee;\n"+

		"At Eltham Place I told your majesty.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"And those occasions, uncle, were of force:\n"+

		"And rise created princely Duke of York.\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+

		"EXETER\n"+
		"Ay, we may march in England or in France,\n"+
		"Not seeing what is likely to ensue.\n"+
		"This late dissension grown betwixt the peers\n"+
		"Burns under feigned ashes of forged love\n"+
		"And will at last break out into a flame:\n"+
		"As fester'd members rot but by degree,\n"+
		"Till bones and flesh and sinews fall away,\n"+
		"So will this base and envious discord breed.\n"+
		"And now I fear that fatal prophecy\n"+
		"Which in the time of Henry named the Fifth\n"+
		"Was in the mouth of every sucking babe;\n"+
		"That Henry born at Monmouth should win all\n"+
		"And Henry born at Windsor lose all:\n"+
		"Which is so plain that Exeter doth wish\n"+
		"His days may finish ere that hapless time.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE II. France. Before Rouen.\n"+
		"Enter JOAN LA PUCELLE disguised, with four Soldiers with sacks upon their backs\n"+
		"JOAN LA PUCELLE\n"+
		"These are the city gates, the gates of Rouen,\n"+
		"Through which our policy must make a breach:\n"+

		"That come to gather money for their corn.\n"+
		"If we have entrance, as I hope we shall,\n"+

		"I'll by a sign give notice to our friends,\n"+
		"That Charles the Dauphin may encounter them.\n"+
		"First Soldier\n"+
		"Our sacks shall be a mean to sack the city,\n"+
		"And we be lords and rulers over Rouen;\n"+

		"Here enter'd Pucelle and her practisants;\n"+
		"Now she is there, how will she specify\n"+
		"Where is the best and safest passage in?\n"+
		"REIGNIER\n"+
		"By thrusting out a torch from yonder tower;\n"+
		"Which, once discern'd, shows that her meaning is,\n"+
		"No way to that, for weakness, which she enter'd.\n"+
		"Enter JOAN LA PUCELLE on the top, thrusting out a torch burning\n"+
		"JOAN LA PUCELLE\n"+
		"Behold, this is the happy wedding torch\n"+
		"That joineth Rouen unto her countrymen,\n"+
		"But burning fatal to the Talbotites!\n"+

		"See, noble Charles, the beacon of our friend;\n"+

		"Good morrow, gallants! want ye corn for bread?\n"+

		"Your grace may starve perhaps before that time.\n"+
		"BEDFORD\n"+
		"O, let no words, but deeds, revenge this treason!\n"+
		"JOAN LA PUCELLE\n"+
		"What will you do, good grey-beard? break a lance,\n"+
		"And run a tilt at death within a chair?\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"Foul fiend of France, and hag of all despite,\n"+
		"Encompass'd with thy lustful paramours!\n"+
		"Becomes it thee to taunt his valiant age\n"+

		"Belike your lordship takes us then for fools,\n"+
		"To try if that our own be ours or no.\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"I speak not to that railing Hecate,\n"+
		"But unto thee, Alencon, and the rest;\n"+
		"Will ye, like soldiers, come and fight it out?\n"+
		"ALENCON\n"+
		"Signior, no.\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"Signior, hang! base muleters of France!\n"+
		"Like peasant foot-boys do they keep the walls\n"+

		"Exeunt from the walls\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"And there will we be too, ere it be long,\n"+
		"Or else reproach be Talbot's greatest fame!\n"+
		"Vow, Burgundy, by honour of thy house,\n"+
		"Prick'd on by public wrongs sustain'd in France,\n"+
		"Either to get the town again or die:\n"+

		"So sure I swear to get the town or die.\n"+
		"BURGUNDY\n"+
		"My vows are equal partners with thy vows.\n"+

		"The valiant Duke of Bedford. Come, my lord,\n"+
		"We will bestow you in some better place,\n"+

		"BEDFORD\n"+
		"Lord Talbot, do not so dishonour me:\n"+

		"Undaunted spirit in a dying breast!\n"+
		"Then be it so: heavens keep old Bedford safe!\n"+
		"And now no more ado, brave Burgundy,\n"+
		"But gather we our forces out of hand\n"+
		"And set upon our boasting enemy.\n"+
		"Exeunt all but BEDFORD and Attendants\n"+
		"An alarum: excursions. Enter FASTOLFE and a Captain\n"+
		"Captain\n"+
		"Whither away, Sir John Fastolfe, in such haste?\n"+
		"FASTOLFE\n"+
		"Whither away! to save myself by flight:\n"+
		"We are like to have the overthrow again.\n"+

		"Now, quiet soul, depart when heaven please,\n"+
		"For I have seen our enemies' overthrow.\n"+
		"What is the trust or strength of foolish man?\n"+
		"They that of late were daring with their scoffs\n"+
		"Are glad and fain by flight to save themselves.\n"+
		"BEDFORD dies, and is carried in by two in his chair\n"+

		"TALBOT\n"+
		"Lost, and recover'd in a day again!\n"+
		"This is a double honour, Burgundy:\n"+
		"Yet heavens have glory for this victory!\n"+

		"Warlike and martial Talbot, Burgundy\n"+
		"Enshrines thee in his heart and there erects\n"+
		"Thy noble deeds as valour's monuments.\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"Thanks, gentle duke. But where is Pucelle now?\n"+
		"I think her old familiar is asleep:\n"+
		"Now where's the Bastard's braves, and Charles his gleeks?\n"+
		"What, all amort? Rouen hangs her head for grief\n"+
		"That such a valiant company are fled.\n"+
		"Now will we take some order in the town,\n"+

		"What wills Lord Talbot pleaseth Burgundy.\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"But yet, before we go, let's not forget\n"+
		"The noble Duke of Bedford late deceased,\n"+
		"But see his exequies fulfill'd in Rouen:\n"+
		"A braver soldier never couched lance,\n"+
		"A gentler heart did never sway in court;\n"+
		"But kings and mightiest potentates must die,\n"+
		"For that's the end of human misery.\n"+

		"Enter CHARLES, the BASTARD OF ORLEANS, ALENCON, JOAN LA PUCELLE, and forces\n"+
		"JOAN LA PUCELLE\n"+
		"Dismay not, princes, at this accident,\n"+
		"Nor grieve that Rouen is so recovered:\n"+
		"Care is no cure, but rather corrosive,\n"+
		"For things that are not to be remedied.\n"+
		"Let frantic Talbot triumph for a while\n"+
		"And like a peacock sweep along his tail;\n"+

		"We'll set thy statue in some holy place,\n"+
		"And have thee reverenced like a blessed saint:\n"+
		"Employ thee then, sweet virgin, for our good.\n"+
		"JOAN LA PUCELLE\n"+
		"Then thus it must be; this doth Joan devise:\n"+
		"By fair persuasions mix'd with sugar'd words\n"+
		"We will entice the Duke of Burgundy\n"+
		"To leave the Talbot and to follow us.\n"+
		"CHARLES\n"+
		"Ay, marry, sweeting, if we could do that,\n"+
		"France were no place for Henry's warriors;\n"+
		"Nor should that nation boast it so with us,\n"+

		"French march. Enter BURGUNDY and forces\n"+
		"Now in the rearward comes the duke and his:\n"+
		"Fortune in favour makes him lag behind.\n"+
		"Summon a parley; we will talk with him.\n"+
		"Trumpets sound a parley\n"+
		"CHARLES\n"+
		"A parley with the Duke of Burgundy!\n"+
		"BURGUNDY\n"+
		"Who craves a parley with the Burgundy?\n"+
		"JOAN LA PUCELLE\n"+
		"The princely Charles of France, thy countryman.\n"+
		"BURGUNDY\n"+
		"What say'st thou, Charles? for I am marching hence.\n"+
		"CHARLES\n"+
		"Speak, Pucelle, and enchant him with thy words.\n"+
		"JOAN LA PUCELLE\n"+
		"Brave Burgundy, undoubted hope of France!\n"+
		"Stay, let thy humble handmaid speak to thee.\n"+
		"BURGUNDY\n"+
		"Speak on; but be not over-tedious.\n"+
		"JOAN LA PUCELLE\n"+
		"Look on thy country, look on fertile France,\n"+
		"And see the cities and the towns defaced\n"+
		"By wasting ruin of the cruel foe.\n"+
		"As looks the mother on her lowly babe\n"+
		"When death doth close his tender dying eyes,\n"+
		"See, see the pining malady of France;\n"+
		"Behold the wounds, the most unnatural wounds,\n"+
		"Which thou thyself hast given her woful breast.\n"+
		"O, turn thy edged sword another way;\n"+
		"Strike those that hurt, and hurt not those that help.\n"+
		"One drop of blood drawn from thy country's bosom\n"+
		"Should grieve thee more than streams of foreign gore:\n"+
		"Return thee therefore with a flood of tears,\n"+
		"And wash away thy country's stained spots.\n"+
		"BURGUNDY\n"+
		"Either she hath bewitch'd me with her words,\n"+
		"Or nature makes me suddenly relent.\n"+
		"JOAN LA PUCELLE\n"+
		"Besides, all French and France exclaims on thee,\n"+
		"Doubting thy birth and lawful progeny.\n"+
		"Who joint'st thou with but with a lordly nation\n"+
		"That will not trust thee but for profit's sake?\n"+
		"When Talbot hath set footing once in France\n"+
		"And fashion'd thee that instrument of ill,\n"+
		"Who then but English Henry will be lord\n"+
		"And thou be thrust out like a fugitive?\n"+
		"Call we to mind, and mark but this for proof,\n"+
		"Was not the Duke of Orleans thy foe?\n"+
		"And was he not in England prisoner?\n"+
		"But when they heard he was thine enemy,\n"+
		"They set him free without his ransom paid,\n"+
		"In spite of Burgundy and all his friends.\n"+
		"See, then, thou fight'st against thy countrymen\n"+
		"And joint'st with them will be thy slaughtermen.\n"+
		"Come, come, return; return, thou wandering lord:\n"+
		"Charles and the rest will take thee in their arms.\n"+
		"BURGUNDY\n"+
		"I am vanquished; these haughty words of hers\n"+
		"Have batter'd me like roaring cannon-shot,\n"+
		"And made me almost yield upon my knees.\n"+
		"Forgive me, country, and sweet countrymen,\n"+
		"And, lords, accept this hearty kind embrace:\n"+
		"My forces and my power of men are yours:\n"+
		"So farewell, Talbot; I'll no longer trust thee.\n"+

		"Before we met or that a stroke was given,\n"+
		"Like to a trusty squire did run away:\n"+
		"In which assault we lost twelve hundred men;\n"+
		"Myself and divers gentlemen beside\n"+
		"Were there surprised and taken prisoners.\n"+
		"Then judge, great lords, if I have done amiss;\n"+
		"Or whether that such cowards ought to wear\n"+
		"This ornament of knighthood, yea or no.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"To say the truth, this fact was infamous\n"+
		"And ill beseeming any common man,\n"+
		"Much more a knight, a captain and a leader.\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"When first this order was ordain'd, my lords,\n"+
		"Knights of the garter were of noble birth,\n"+
		"Valiant and virtuous, full of haughty courage,\n"+
		"Such as were grown to credit by the wars;\n"+
		"Not fearing death, nor shrinking for distress,\n"+
		"But always resolute in most extremes.\n"+
		"He then that is not furnish'd in this sort\n"+
		"Doth but usurp the sacred name of knight,\n"+
		"Profaning this most honourable order,\n"+
		"And should, if I were worthy to be judge,\n"+
		"Be quite degraded, like a hedge-born swain\n"+
		"That doth presume to boast of gentle blood.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Stain to thy countrymen, thou hear'st thy doom!\n"+
		"Be packing, therefore, thou that wast a knight:\n"+
		"Henceforth we banish thee, on pain of death.\n"+
		"Exit FASTOLFE\n"+
		"And now, my lord protector, view the letter\n"+
		"Sent from our uncle Duke of Burgundy.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"What means his grace, that he hath changed his style?\n"+
		"No more but, plain and bluntly, 'To the king!'\n"+
		"Hath he forgot he is his sovereign?\n"+
		"Or doth this churlish superscription\n"+
		"Pretend some alteration in good will?\n"+
		"What's here?\n"+
		"Reads\n"+
		"'I have, upon especial cause,\n"+
		"Moved with compassion of my country's wreck,\n"+
		"Together with the pitiful complaints\n"+
		"Of such as your oppression feeds upon,\n"+
		"Forsaken your pernicious faction\n"+
		"And join'd with Charles, the rightful King of France.'\n"+
		"O monstrous treachery! can this be so,\n"+
		"That in alliance, amity and oaths,\n"+
		"There should be found such false dissembling guile?\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"What! doth my uncle Burgundy revolt?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"He doth, my lord, and is become your foe.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Is that the worst this letter doth contain?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"It is the worst, and all, my lord, he writes.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Why, then, Lord Talbot there shall talk with him\n"+
		"And give him chastisement for this abuse.\n"+
		"How say you, my lord? are you not content?\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"Content, my liege! yes, but that I am prevented,\n"+
		"I should have begg'd I might have been employ'd.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Then gather strength and march unto him straight:\n"+
		"Let him perceive how ill we brook his treason\n"+
		"And what offence it is to flout his friends.\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"I go, my lord, in heart desiring still\n"+
		"You may behold confusion of your foes.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"Enter VERNON and BASSET\n"+
		"VERNON\n"+
		"Grant me the combat, gracious sovereign.\n"+
		"BASSET\n"+
		"And me, my lord, grant me the combat too.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"This is my servant: hear him, noble prince.\n"+
		"SOMERSET\n"+
		"And this is mine: sweet Henry, favour him.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Be patient, lords; and give them leave to speak.\n"+
		"Say, gentlemen, what makes you thus exclaim?\n"+
		"And wherefore crave you combat? or with whom?\n"+
		"VERNON\n"+
		"With him, my lord; for he hath done me wrong.\n"+
		"BASSET\n"+
		"And I with him; for he hath done me wrong.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"What is that wrong whereof you both complain?\n"+
		"First let me know, and then I'll answer you.\n"+
		"BASSET\n"+
		"Crossing the sea from England into France,\n"+
		"This fellow here, with envious carping tongue,\n"+
		"Upbraided me about the rose I wear;\n"+
		"Saying, the sanguine colour of the leaves\n"+
		"Did represent my master's blushing cheeks,\n"+
		"When stubbornly he did repugn the truth\n"+
		"About a certain question in the law\n"+
		"Argued betwixt the Duke of York and him;\n"+
		"With other vile and ignominious terms:\n"+
		"In confutation of which rude reproach\n"+
		"And in defence of my lord's worthiness,\n"+
		"I crave the benefit of law of arms.\n"+
		"VERNON\n"+
		"And that is my petition, noble lord:\n"+
		"For though he seem with forged quaint conceit\n"+
		"To set a gloss upon his bold intent,\n"+
		"Yet know, my lord, I was provoked by him;\n"+
		"And he first took exceptions at this badge,\n"+
		"Pronouncing that the paleness of this flower\n"+
		"Bewray'd the faintness of my master's heart.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"Will not this malice, Somerset, be left?\n"+
		"SOMERSET\n"+
		"Your private grudge, my Lord of York, will out,\n"+
		"Though ne'er so cunningly you smother it.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Good Lord, what madness rules in brainsick men,\n"+
		"When for so slight and frivolous a cause\n"+
		"Such factious emulations shall arise!\n"+
		"Good cousins both, of York and Somerset,\n"+
		"Quiet yourselves, I pray, and be at peace.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"Let this dissension first be tried by fight,\n"+
		"And then your highness shall command a peace.\n"+
		"SOMERSET\n"+
		"The quarrel toucheth none but us alone;\n"+
		"Betwixt ourselves let us decide it then.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"There is my pledge; accept it, Somerset.\n"+
		"VERNON\n"+
		"Nay, let it rest where it began at first.\n"+
		"BASSET\n"+
		"Confirm it so, mine honourable lord.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Confirm it so! Confounded be your strife!\n"+
		"And perish ye, with your audacious prate!\n"+
		"Presumptuous vassals, are you not ashamed\n"+
		"With this immodest clamorous outrage\n"+
		"To trouble and disturb the king and us?\n"+
		"And you, my lords, methinks you do not well\n"+
		"To bear with their perverse objections;\n"+
		"Much less to take occasion from their mouths\n"+
		"To raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves:\n"+
		"Let me persuade you take a better course.\n"+
		"EXETER\n"+
		"It grieves his highness: good my lords, be friends.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Come hither, you that would be combatants:\n"+
		"Henceforth I charge you, as you love our favour,\n"+
		"Quite to forget this quarrel and the cause.\n"+
		"And you, my lords, remember where we are,\n"+
		"In France, amongst a fickle wavering nation:\n"+
		"If they perceive dissension in our looks\n"+
		"And that within ourselves we disagree,\n"+
		"How will their grudging stomachs be provoked\n"+
		"To wilful disobedience, and rebel!\n"+
		"Beside, what infamy will there arise,\n"+
		"When foreign princes shall be certified\n"+
		"That for a toy, a thing of no regard,\n"+
		"King Henry's peers and chief nobility\n"+
		"Destroy'd themselves, and lost the realm of France!\n"+
		"O, think upon the conquest of my father,\n"+
		"My tender years, and let us not forego\n"+
		"That for a trifle that was bought with blood\n"+
		"Let me be umpire in this doubtful strife.\n"+
		"I see no reason, if I wear this rose,\n"+
		"Putting on a red rose\n"+
		"That any one should therefore be suspicious\n"+
		"I more incline to Somerset than York:\n"+
		"Both are my kinsmen, and I love them both:\n"+
		"As well they may upbraid me with my crown,\n"+
		"Because, forsooth, the king of Scots is crown'd.\n"+
		"But your discretions better can persuade\n"+
		"Than I am able to instruct or teach:\n"+
		"And therefore, as we hither came in peace,\n"+
		"So let us still continue peace and love.\n"+
		"Cousin of York, we institute your grace\n"+
		"To be our regent in these parts of France:\n"+
		"And, good my Lord of Somerset, unite\n"+
		"Your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot;\n"+
		"And, like true subjects, sons of your progenitors,\n"+
		"Go cheerfully together and digest.\n"+
		"Your angry choler on your enemies.\n"+
		"Ourself, my lord protector and the rest\n"+
		"After some respite will return to Calais;\n"+
		"From thence to England; where I hope ere long\n"+
		"To be presented, by your victories,\n"+
		"With Charles, Alencon and that traitorous rout.\n"+
		"Flourish. Exeunt all but YORK, WARWICK, EXETER and VERNON\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"My Lord of York, I promise you, the king\n"+
		"Prettily, methought, did play the orator.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"And so he did; but yet I like it not,\n"+
		"In that he wears the badge of Somerset.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Tush, that was but his fancy, blame him not;\n"+
		"I dare presume, sweet prince, he thought no harm.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"An if I wist he did,--but let it rest;\n"+
		"Other affairs must now be managed.\n"+
		"Exeunt all but EXETER\n"+
		"EXETER\n"+
		"Well didst thou, Richard, to suppress thy voice;\n"+
		"For, had the passions of thy heart burst out,\n"+
		"I fear we should have seen decipher'd there\n"+
		"More rancorous spite, more furious raging broils,\n"+
		"Than yet can be imagined or supposed.\n"+
		"But howsoe'er, no simple man that sees\n"+
		"This jarring discord of nobility,\n"+
		"This shouldering of each other in the court,\n"+
		"This factious bandying of their favourites,\n"+
		"But that it doth presage some ill event.\n"+
		"'Tis much when sceptres are in children's hands;\n"+
		"But more when envy breeds unkind division;\n"+
		"There comes the rain, there begins confusion.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE II. Before Bourdeaux.\n"+
		"Enter TALBOT, with trump and drum\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"Go to the gates of Bourdeaux, trumpeter:\n"+
		"Summon their general unto the wall.\n"+
		"Trumpet sounds. Enter General and others, aloft\n"+
		"English John Talbot, captains, calls you forth,\n"+
		"Servant in arms to Harry King of England;\n"+
		"And thus he would: Open your city gates;\n"+
		"Be humble to us; call my sovereign yours,\n"+
		"And do him homage as obedient subjects;\n"+
		"And I'll withdraw me and my bloody power:\n"+
		"But, if you frown upon this proffer'd peace,\n"+
		"You tempt the fury of my three attendants,\n"+
		"Lean famine, quartering steel, and climbing fire;\n"+
		"Who in a moment even with the earth\n"+
		"Shall lay your stately and air-braving towers,\n"+
		"If you forsake the offer of their love.\n"+
		"General\n"+
		"Thou ominous and fearful owl of death,\n"+
		"Our nation's terror and their bloody scourge!\n"+
		"The period of thy tyranny approacheth.\n"+
		"On us thou canst not enter but by death;\n"+
		"For, I protest, we are well fortified\n"+
		"And strong enough to issue out and fight:\n"+
		"If thou retire, the Dauphin, well appointed,\n"+
		"Stands with the snares of war to tangle thee:\n"+
		"On either hand thee there are squadrons pitch'd,\n"+
		"To wall thee from the liberty of flight;\n"+
		"And no way canst thou turn thee for redress,\n"+
		"But death doth front thee with apparent spoil\n"+
		"And pale destruction meets thee in the face.\n"+
		"Ten thousand French have ta'en the sacrament\n"+
		"To rive their dangerous artillery\n"+
		"Upon no Christian soul but English Talbot.\n"+
		"Lo, there thou stand'st, a breathing valiant man,\n"+
		"Of an invincible unconquer'd spirit!\n"+
		"This is the latest glory of thy praise\n"+
		"That I, thy enemy, due thee withal;\n"+
		"For ere the glass, that now begins to run,\n"+
		"Finish the process of his sandy hour,\n"+
		"These eyes, that see thee now well coloured,\n"+
		"Shall see thee wither'd, bloody, pale and dead.\n"+
		"Drum afar off\n"+
		"Hark! hark! the Dauphin's drum, a warning bell,\n"+
		"Sings heavy music to thy timorous soul;\n"+
		"And mine shall ring thy dire departure out.\n"+
		"Exeunt General, & c\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"He fables not; I hear the enemy:\n"+
		"Out, some light horsemen, and peruse their wings.\n"+
		"O, negligent and heedless discipline!\n"+
		"How are we park'd and bounded in a pale,\n"+
		"A little herd of England's timorous deer,\n"+
		"Mazed with a yelping kennel of French curs!\n"+
		"If we be English deer, be then in blood;\n"+
		"Not rascal-like, to fall down with a pinch,\n"+
		"But rather, moody-mad and desperate stags,\n"+
		"Turn on the bloody hounds with heads of steel\n"+
		"And make the cowards stand aloof at bay:\n"+
		"Sell every man his life as dear as mine,\n"+
		"And they shall find dear deer of us, my friends.\n"+
		"God and Saint George, Talbot and England's right,\n"+
		"Prosper our colours in this dangerous fight!\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. Plains in Gascony.\n"+
		"Enter a Messenger that meets YORK. Enter YORK with trumpet and many Soldiers\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"Are not the speedy scouts return'd again,\n"+
		"That dogg'd the mighty army of the Dauphin?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"They are return'd, my lord, and give it out\n"+
		"That he is march'd to Bourdeaux with his power,\n"+
		"To fight with Talbot: as he march'd along,\n"+
		"By your espials were discovered\n"+
		"Two mightier troops than that the Dauphin led,\n"+
		"Which join'd with him and made their march for Bourdeaux.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"A plague upon that villain Somerset,\n"+
		"That thus delays my promised supply\n"+
		"Of horsemen, that were levied for this siege!\n"+
		"Renowned Talbot doth expect my aid,\n"+
		"And I am lowted by a traitor villain\n"+
		"And cannot help the noble chevalier:\n"+
		"God comfort him in this necessity!\n"+
		"If he miscarry, farewell wars in France.\n"+
		"Enter Sir William LUCY\n"+
		"LUCY\n"+
		"Thou princely leader of our English strength,\n"+
		"Never so needful on the earth of France,\n"+
		"Spur to the rescue of the noble Talbot,\n"+
		"Who now is girdled with a waist of iron\n"+
		"And hemm'd about with grim destruction:\n"+
		"To Bourdeaux, warlike duke! to Bourdeaux, York!\n"+
		"Else, farewell Talbot, France, and England's honour.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"O God, that Somerset, who in proud heart\n"+
		"Doth stop my cornets, were in Talbot's place!\n"+
		"So should we save a valiant gentleman\n"+
		"By forfeiting a traitor and a coward.\n"+
		"Mad ire and wrathful fury makes me weep,\n"+
		"That thus we die, while remiss traitors sleep.\n"+
		"LUCY\n"+
		"O, send some succor to the distress'd lord!\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"He dies, we lose; I break my warlike word;\n"+
		"We mourn, France smiles; we lose, they daily get;\n"+
		"All 'long of this vile traitor Somerset.\n"+
		"LUCY\n"+
		"Then God take mercy on brave Talbot's soul;\n"+
		"And on his son young John, who two hours since\n"+
		"I met in travel toward his warlike father!\n"+
		"This seven years did not Talbot see his son;\n"+
		"And now they meet where both their lives are done.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"Alas, what joy shall noble Talbot have\n"+
		"To bid his young son welcome to his grave?\n"+
		"Away! vexation almost stops my breath,\n"+
		"That sunder'd friends greet in the hour of death.\n"+
		"Lucy, farewell; no more my fortune can,\n"+
		"But curse the cause I cannot aid the man.\n"+
		"Maine, Blois, Poictiers, and Tours, are won away,\n"+
		"'Long all of Somerset and his delay.\n"+
		"Exit, with his soldiers\n"+
		"LUCY\n"+
		"Thus, while the vulture of sedition\n"+
		"Feeds in the bosom of such great commanders,\n"+
		"Sleeping neglection doth betray to loss\n"+
		"The conquest of our scarce cold conqueror,\n"+
		"That ever living man of memory,\n"+
		"Henry the Fifth: whiles they each other cross,\n"+
		"Lives, honours, lands and all hurry to loss.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE IV. Other plains in Gascony.\n"+
		"Enter SOMERSET, with his army; a Captain of TALBOT's with him\n"+
		"SOMERSET\n"+
		"It is too late; I cannot send them now:\n"+
		"This expedition was by York and Talbot\n"+
		"Too rashly plotted: all our general force\n"+
		"Might with a sally of the very town\n"+
		"Be buckled with: the over-daring Talbot\n"+
		"Hath sullied all his gloss of former honour\n"+
		"By this unheedful, desperate, wild adventure:\n"+
		"York set him on to fight and die in shame,\n"+
		"That, Talbot dead, great York might bear the name.\n"+
		"Captain\n"+
		"Here is Sir William Lucy, who with me\n"+
		"Set from our o'ermatch'd forces forth for aid.\n"+
		"Enter Sir William LUCY\n"+
		"SOMERSET\n"+
		"How now, Sir William! whither were you sent?\n"+
		"LUCY\n"+
		"Whither, my lord? from bought and sold Lord Talbot;\n"+
		"Who, ring'd about with bold adversity,\n"+
		"Cries out for noble York and Somerset,\n"+
		"To beat assailing death from his weak legions:\n"+
		"And whiles the honourable captain there\n"+
		"Drops bloody sweat from his war-wearied limbs,\n"+
		"And, in advantage lingering, looks for rescue,\n"+
		"You, his false hopes, the trust of England's honour,\n"+
		"Keep off aloof with worthless emulation.\n"+
		"Let not your private discord keep away\n"+
		"The levied succors that should lend him aid,\n"+
		"While he, renowned noble gentleman,\n"+
		"Yields up his life unto a world of odds:\n"+
		"Orleans the Bastard, Charles, Burgundy,\n"+
		"Alencon, Reignier, compass him about,\n"+
		"And Talbot perisheth by your default.\n"+
		"SOMERSET\n"+
		"York set him on; York should have sent him aid.\n"+
		"LUCY\n"+
		"And York as fast upon your grace exclaims;\n"+
		"Swearing that you withhold his levied host,\n"+
		"Collected for this expedition.\n"+
		"SOMERSET\n"+
		"York lies; he might have sent and had the horse;\n"+
		"I owe him little duty, and less love;\n"+
		"And take foul scorn to fawn on him by sending.\n"+
		"LUCY\n"+
		"The fraud of England, not the force of France,\n"+
		"Hath now entrapp'd the noble-minded Talbot:\n"+
		"Never to England shall he bear his life;\n"+
		"But dies, betray'd to fortune by your strife.\n"+
		"SOMERSET\n"+
		"Come, go; I will dispatch the horsemen straight:\n"+
		"Within six hours they will be at his aid.\n"+
		"LUCY\n"+
		"Too late comes rescue: he is ta'en or slain;\n"+
		"For fly he could not, if he would have fled;\n"+
		"And fly would Talbot never, though he might.\n"+
		"SOMERSET\n"+
		"If he be dead, brave Talbot, then adieu!\n"+
		"LUCY\n"+
		"His fame lives in the world, his shame in you.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE V. The English camp near Bourdeaux.\n"+
		"Enter TALBOT and JOHN his son\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"O young John Talbot! I did send for thee\n"+
		"To tutor thee in stratagems of war,\n"+
		"That Talbot's name might be in thee revived\n"+
		"When sapless age and weak unable limbs\n"+
		"Should bring thy father to his drooping chair.\n"+
		"But, O malignant and ill-boding stars!\n"+
		"Now thou art come unto a feast of death,\n"+
		"A terrible and unavoided danger:\n"+
		"Therefore, dear boy, mount on my swiftest horse;\n"+
		"And I'll direct thee how thou shalt escape\n"+
		"By sudden flight: come, dally not, be gone.\n"+
		"JOHN TALBOT\n"+
		"Is my name Talbot? and am I your son?\n"+
		"And shall I fly? O if you love my mother,\n"+
		"Dishonour not her honourable name,\n"+
		"To make a bastard and a slave of me!\n"+
		"The world will say, he is not Talbot's blood,\n"+
		"That basely fled when noble Talbot stood.\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"Fly, to revenge my death, if I be slain.\n"+
		"JOHN TALBOT\n"+
		"He that flies so will ne'er return again.\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"If we both stay, we both are sure to die.\n"+
		"JOHN TALBOT\n"+
		"Then let me stay; and, father, do you fly:\n"+
		"Your loss is great, so your regard should be;\n"+
		"My worth unknown, no loss is known in me.\n"+
		"Upon my death the French can little boast;\n"+
		"In yours they will, in you all hopes are lost.\n"+
		"Flight cannot stain the honour you have won;\n"+
		"But mine it will, that no exploit have done:\n"+
		"You fled for vantage, everyone will swear;\n"+
		"But, if I bow, they'll say it was for fear.\n"+
		"There is no hope that ever I will stay,\n"+
		"If the first hour I shrink and run away.\n"+
		"Here on my knee I beg mortality,\n"+
		"Rather than life preserved with infamy.\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"Shall all thy mother's hopes lie in one tomb?\n"+
		"JOHN TALBOT\n"+
		"Ay, rather than I'll shame my mother's womb.\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"Upon my blessing, I command thee go.\n"+
		"JOHN TALBOT\n"+
		"To fight I will, but not to fly the foe.\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"Part of thy father may be saved in thee.\n"+
		"JOHN TALBOT\n"+
		"No part of him but will be shame in me.\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"Thou never hadst renown, nor canst not lose it.\n"+
		"JOHN TALBOT\n"+
		"Yes, your renowned name: shall flight abuse it?\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"Thy father's charge shall clear thee from that stain.\n"+
		"JOHN TALBOT\n"+
		"You cannot witness for me, being slain.\n"+
		"If death be so apparent, then both fly.\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"And leave my followers here to fight and die?\n"+
		"My age was never tainted with such shame.\n"+
		"JOHN TALBOT\n"+
		"And shall my youth be guilty of such blame?\n"+
		"No more can I be sever'd from your side,\n"+
		"Than can yourself yourself in twain divide:\n"+
		"Stay, go, do what you will, the like do I;\n"+
		"For live I will not, if my father die.\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"Then here I take my leave of thee, fair son,\n"+
		"Born to eclipse thy life this afternoon.\n"+
		"Come, side by side together live and die.\n"+
		"And soul with soul from France to heaven fly.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE VI. A field of battle.\n"+
		"Alarum: excursions, wherein JOHN TALBOT is hemmed about, and TALBOT rescues him\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"Saint George and victory! fight, soldiers, fight.\n"+
		"The regent hath with Talbot broke his word\n"+
		"And left us to the rage of France his sword.\n"+
		"Where is John Talbot? Pause, and take thy breath;\n"+
		"I gave thee life and rescued thee from death.\n"+
		"JOHN TALBOT\n"+
		"O, twice my father, twice am I thy son!\n"+
		"The life thou gavest me first was lost and done,\n"+
		"Till with thy warlike sword, despite of late,\n"+
		"To my determined time thou gavest new date.\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"When from the Dauphin's crest thy sword struck fire,\n"+
		"It warm'd thy father's heart with proud desire\n"+
		"Of bold-faced victory. Then leaden age,\n"+
		"Quicken'd with youthful spleen and warlike rage,\n"+
		"Beat down Alencon, Orleans, Burgundy,\n"+
		"And from the pride of Gallia rescued thee.\n"+
		"The ireful bastard Orleans, that drew blood\n"+
		"From thee, my boy, and had the maidenhood\n"+
		"Of thy first fight, I soon encountered,\n"+
		"And interchanging blows I quickly shed\n"+
		"Some of his bastard blood; and in disgrace\n"+
		"Bespoke him thus; 'Contaminated, base\n"+
		"And misbegotten blood I spill of thine,\n"+
		"Mean and right poor, for that pure blood of mine\n"+
		"Which thou didst force from Talbot, my brave boy:'\n"+
		"Here, purposing the Bastard to destroy,\n"+
		"Came in strong rescue. Speak, thy father's care,\n"+
		"Art thou not weary, John? how dost thou fare?\n"+
		"Wilt thou yet leave the battle, boy, and fly,\n"+
		"Now thou art seal'd the son of chivalry?\n"+
		"Fly, to revenge my death when I am dead:\n"+
		"The help of one stands me in little stead.\n"+
		"O, too much folly is it, well I wot,\n"+
		"To hazard all our lives in one small boat!\n"+
		"If I to-day die not with Frenchmen's rage,\n"+
		"To-morrow I shall die with mickle age:\n"+
		"By me they nothing gain an if I stay;\n"+
		"'Tis but the shortening of my life one day:\n"+
		"In thee thy mother dies, our household's name,\n"+
		"My death's revenge, thy youth, and England's fame:\n"+
		"All these and more we hazard by thy stay;\n"+
		"All these are saved if thou wilt fly away.\n"+
		"JOHN TALBOT\n"+
		"The sword of Orleans hath not made me smart;\n"+
		"These words of yours draw life-blood from my heart:\n"+
		"On that advantage, bought with such a shame,\n"+

		"Before young Talbot from old Talbot fly,\n"+
		"The coward horse that bears me fail and die!\n"+
		"And like me to the peasant boys of France,\n"+
		"To be shame's scorn and subject of mischance!\n"+
		"Surely, by all the glory you have won,\n"+
		"An if I fly, I am not Talbot's son:\n"+
		"Then talk no more of flight, it is no boot;\n"+
		"If son to Talbot, die at Talbot's foot.\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"Then follow thou thy desperate sire of Crete,\n"+
		"Thou Icarus; thy life to me is sweet:\n"+

		"TALBOT\n"+
		"Where is my other life? mine own is gone;\n"+
		"O, where's young Talbot? where is valiant John?\n"+
		"Triumphant death, smear'd with captivity,\n"+
		"Young Talbot's valour makes me smile at thee:\n"+
		"When he perceived me shrink and on my knee,\n"+
		"His bloody sword he brandish'd over me,\n"+
		"And, like a hungry lion, did commence\n"+
		"Rough deeds of rage and stern impatience;\n"+
		"But when my angry guardant stood alone,\n"+
		"Tendering my ruin and assail'd of none,\n"+
		"Dizzy-eyed fury and great rage of heart\n"+
		"Suddenly made him from my side to start\n"+
		"Into the clustering battle of the French;\n"+
		"And in that sea of blood my boy did drench\n"+
		"His over-mounting spirit, and there died,\n"+
		"My Icarus, my blossom, in his pride.\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"O, my dear lord, lo, where your son is borne!\n"+
		"Enter Soldiers, with the body of JOHN TALBOT\n"+
		"TALBOT\n"+
		"Thou antic death, which laugh'st us here to scorn,\n"+
		"Anon, from thy insulting tyranny,\n"+
		"Coupled in bonds of perpetuity,\n"+
		"Two Talbots, winged through the lither sky,\n"+
		"In thy despite shall 'scape mortality.\n"+
		"O, thou, whose wounds become hard-favour'd death,\n"+
		"Speak to thy father ere thou yield thy breath!\n"+
		"Brave death by speaking, whether he will or no;\n"+
		"Imagine him a Frenchman and thy foe.\n"+
		"Poor boy! he smiles, methinks, as who should say,\n"+
		"Had death been French, then death had died to-day.\n"+
		"Come, come and lay him in his father's arms:\n"+
		"My spirit can no longer bear these harms.\n"+
		"Soldiers, adieu! I have what I would have,\n"+
		"Now my old arms are young John Talbot's grave.\n"+

		"CHARLES\n"+
		"Had York and Somerset brought rescue in,\n"+
		"We should have found a bloody day of this.\n"+
		"BASTARD OF ORLEANS\n"+
		"How the young whelp of Talbot's, raging-wood,\n"+
		"Did flesh his puny sword in Frenchmen's blood!\n"+
		"JOAN LA PUCELLE\n"+
		"Once I encounter'd him, and thus I said:\n"+
		"'Thou maiden youth, be vanquish'd by a maid:'\n"+
		"But, with a proud majestical high scorn,\n"+
		"He answer'd thus: 'Young Talbot was not born\n"+
		"To be the pillage of a giglot wench:'\n"+
		"So, rushing in the bowels of the French,\n"+
		"He left me proudly, as unworthy fight.\n"+
		"BURGUNDY\n"+
		"Doubtless he would have made a noble knight;\n"+
		"See, where he lies inhearsed in the arms\n"+
		"Of the most bloody nurser of his harms!\n"+
		"BASTARD OF ORLEANS\n"+
		"Hew them to pieces, hack their bones asunder\n"+

		"During the life, let us not wrong it dead.\n"+
		"Enter Sir William LUCY, attended; Herald of the French preceding\n"+
		"LUCY\n"+
		"Herald, conduct me to the Dauphin's tent,\n"+
		"To know who hath obtained the glory of the day.\n"+
		"CHARLES\n"+
		"On what submissive message art thou sent?\n"+
		"LUCY\n"+
		"Submission, Dauphin! 'tis a mere French word;\n"+
		"We English warriors wot not what it means.\n"+
		"I come to know what prisoners thou hast ta'en\n"+
		"And to survey the bodies of the dead.\n"+
		"CHARLES\n"+
		"For prisoners ask'st thou? hell our prison is.\n"+
		"But tell me whom thou seek'st.\n"+
		"LUCY\n"+
		"But where's the great Alcides of the field,\n"+
		"Valiant Lord Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury,\n"+
		"Created, for his rare success in arms,\n"+
		"Great Earl of Washford, Waterford and Valence;\n"+

		"JOAN LA PUCELLE\n"+
		"Here is a silly stately style indeed!\n"+
		"The Turk, that two and fifty kingdoms hath,\n"+
		"Writes not so tedious a style as this.\n"+
		"Him that thou magnifiest with all these titles\n"+
		"Stinking and fly-blown lies here at our feet.\n"+
		"LUCY\n"+
		"Is Talbot slain, the Frenchmen's only scourge,\n"+
		"Your kingdom's terror and black Nemesis?\n"+
		"O, were mine eyeballs into bullets turn'd,\n"+
		"That I in rage might shoot them at your faces!\n"+
		"O, that I could but call these dead to life!\n"+
		"It were enough to fright the realm of France:\n"+
		"Were but his picture left amongst you here,\n"+
		"It would amaze the proudest of you all.\n"+
		"Give me their bodies, that I may bear them hence\n"+
		"And give them burial as beseems their worth.\n"+
		"JOAN LA PUCELLE\n"+
		"I think this upstart is old Talbot's ghost,\n"+
		"He speaks with such a proud commanding spirit.\n"+
		"For God's sake let him have 'em; to keep them here,\n"+
		"They would but stink, and putrefy the air.\n"+
		"CHARLES\n"+
		"Go, take their bodies hence.\n"+
		"LUCY\n"+
		"I'll bear them hence; but from their ashes shall be rear'd\n"+
		"A phoenix that shall make all France afeard.\n"+
		"CHARLES\n"+
		"So we be rid of them, do with 'em what thou wilt.\n"+

		"Between the realms of England and of France.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"How doth your grace affect their motion?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Well, my good lord; and as the only means\n"+
		"To stop effusion of our Christian blood\n"+
		"And 'stablish quietness on every side.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Ay, marry, uncle; for I always thought\n"+
		"It was both impious and unnatural\n"+
		"That such immanity and bloody strife\n"+
		"Should reign among professors of one faith.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Beside, my lord, the sooner to effect\n"+
		"And surer bind this knot of amity,\n"+
		"The Earl of Armagnac, near knit to Charles,\n"+
		"A man of great authority in France,\n"+
		"Proffers his only daughter to your grace\n"+
		"In marriage, with a large and sumptuous dowry.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Marriage, uncle! alas, my years are young!\n"+
		"And fitter is my study and my books\n"+
		"Than wanton dalliance with a paramour.\n"+
		"Yet call the ambassador; and, as you please,\n"+
		"So let them have their answers every one:\n"+
		"I shall be well content with any choice\n"+

		"Then I perceive that will be verified\n"+

		"'If once he come to be a cardinal,\n"+
		"He'll make his cap co-equal with the crown.'\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"My lords ambassadors, your several suits\n"+
		"Have been consider'd and debated on.\n"+

		"To draw conditions of a friendly peace;\n"+
		"Which by my Lord of Winchester we mean\n"+
		"Shall be transported presently to France.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"And for the proffer of my lord your master,\n"+

		"As liking of the lady's virtuous gifts,\n"+
		"Her beauty and the value of her dower,\n"+
		"He doth intend she shall be England's queen.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"In argument and proof of which contract,\n"+

		"CHARLES\n"+
		"Somewhat too sudden, sirs, the warning is;\n"+

		"You speedy helpers, that are substitutes\n"+
		"Under the lordly monarch of the north,\n"+
		"Appear and aid me in this enterprise.\n"+
		"Enter Fiends\n"+
		"This speedy and quick appearance argues proof\n"+
		"Of your accustom'd diligence to me.\n"+
		"Now, ye familiar spirits, that are cull'd\n"+

		"Where I was wont to feed you with my blood,\n"+
		"I'll lop a member off and give it you\n"+
		"In earnest of further benefit,\n"+
		"So you do condescend to help me now.\n"+
		"They hang their heads\n"+
		"No hope to have redress? My body shall\n"+
		"Pay recompense, if you will grant my suit.\n"+
		"They shake their heads\n"+
		"Cannot my body nor blood-sacrifice\n"+

		"YORK\n"+
		"Damsel of France, I think I have you fast:\n"+
		"Unchain your spirits now with spelling charms\n"+
		"And try if they can gain your liberty.\n"+
		"A goodly prize, fit for the devil's grace!\n"+
		"See, how the ugly wench doth bend her brows,\n"+
		"As if with Circe she would change my shape!\n"+
		"JOAN LA PUCELLE\n"+
		"Changed to a worser shape thou canst not be.\n"+

		"O, Charles the Dauphin is a proper man;\n"+
		"No shape but his can please your dainty eye.\n"+

		"Be what thou wilt, thou art my prisoner.\n"+
		"Gazes on her\n"+
		"O fairest beauty, do not fear nor fly!\n"+
		"For I will touch thee but with reverent hands;\n"+
		"I kiss these fingers for eternal peace,\n"+
		"And lay them gently on thy tender side.\n"+
		"Who art thou? say, that I may honour thee.\n"+
		"MARGARET\n"+
		"Margaret my name, and daughter to a king,\n"+
		"The King of Naples, whosoe'er thou art.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"An earl I am, and Suffolk am I call'd.\n"+
		"Be not offended, nature's miracle,\n"+
		"Thou art allotted to be ta'en by me:\n"+
		"So doth the swan her downy cygnets save,\n"+
		"Keeping them prisoner underneath her wings.\n"+
		"Yet, if this servile usage once offend.\n"+
		"Go, and be free again, as Suffolk's friend.\n"+
		"She is going\n"+
		"O, stay! I have no power to let her pass;\n"+
		"My hand would free her, but my heart says no\n"+
		"As plays the sun upon the glassy streams,\n"+
		"Twinkling another counterfeited beam,\n"+
		"So seems this gorgeous beauty to mine eyes.\n"+
		"Fain would I woo her, yet I dare not speak:\n"+
		"I'll call for pen and ink, and write my mind.\n"+
		"Fie, de la Pole! disable not thyself;\n"+
		"Hast not a tongue? is she not here?\n"+
		"Wilt thou be daunted at a woman's sight?\n"+
		"Ay, beauty's princely majesty is such,\n"+
		"Confounds the tongue and makes the senses rough.\n"+
		"MARGARET\n"+
		"Say, Earl of Suffolk--if thy name be so--\n"+
		"What ransom must I pay before I pass?\n"+
		"For I perceive I am thy prisoner.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"How canst thou tell she will deny thy suit,\n"+
		"Before thou make a trial of her love?\n"+
		"MARGARET\n"+
		"Why speak'st thou not? what ransom must I pay?\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"She's beautiful, and therefore to be woo'd;\n"+
		"She is a woman, therefore to be won.\n"+
		"MARGARET\n"+
		"Wilt thou accept of ransom? yea, or no.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Fond man, remember that thou hast a wife;\n"+
		"Then how can Margaret be thy paramour?\n"+
		"MARGARET\n"+
		"I were best to leave him, for he will not hear.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"There all is marr'd; there lies a cooling card.\n"+
		"MARGARET\n"+
		"He talks at random; sure, the man is mad.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"And yet a dispensation may be had.\n"+
		"MARGARET\n"+
		"And yet I would that you would answer me.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"I'll win this Lady Margaret. For whom?\n"+
		"Why, for my king: tush, that's a wooden thing!\n"+
		"MARGARET\n"+
		"He talks of wood: it is some carpenter.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Yet so my fancy may be satisfied,\n"+
		"And peace established between these realms\n"+
		"But there remains a scruple in that too;\n"+
		"For though her father be the King of Naples,\n"+
		"Duke of Anjou and Maine, yet is he poor,\n"+
		"And our nobility will scorn the match.\n"+
		"MARGARET\n"+
		"Hear ye, captain, are you not at leisure?\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"It shall be so, disdain they ne'er so much.\n"+
		"Henry is youthful and will quickly yield.\n"+
		"Madam, I have a secret to reveal.\n"+
		"MARGARET\n"+
		"What though I be enthrall'd? he seems a knight,\n"+
		"And will not any way dishonour me.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Lady, vouchsafe to listen what I say.\n"+
		"MARGARET\n"+
		"Perhaps I shall be rescued by the French;\n"+
		"And then I need not crave his courtesy.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Sweet madam, give me a hearing in a cause--\n"+
		"MARGARET\n"+
		"Tush, women have been captivate ere now.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Lady, wherefore talk you so?\n"+
		"MARGARET\n"+
		"I cry you mercy, 'tis but Quid for Quo.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Say, gentle princess, would you not suppose\n"+
		"Your bondage happy, to be made a queen?\n"+
		"MARGARET\n"+
		"To be a queen in bondage is more vile\n"+
		"Than is a slave in base servility;\n"+
		"For princes should be free.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"And so shall you,\n"+
		"If happy England's royal king be free.\n"+
		"MARGARET\n"+
		"Why, what concerns his freedom unto me?\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"I'll undertake to make thee Henry's queen,\n"+
		"To put a golden sceptre in thy hand\n"+
		"And set a precious crown upon thy head,\n"+
		"If thou wilt condescend to be my--\n"+
		"MARGARET\n"+
		"What?\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"His love.\n"+
		"MARGARET\n"+
		"I am unworthy to be Henry's wife.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"No, gentle madam; I unworthy am\n"+
		"To woo so fair a dame to be his wife,\n"+
		"And have no portion in the choice myself.\n"+
		"How say you, madam, are ye so content?\n"+
		"MARGARET\n"+
		"An if my father please, I am content.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Then call our captains and our colours forth.\n"+
		"And, madam, at your father's castle walls\n"+
		"We'll crave a parley, to confer with him.\n"+
		"A parley sounded. Enter REIGNIER on the walls\n"+
		"See, Reignier, see, thy daughter prisoner!\n"+
		"REIGNIER\n"+
		"To whom?\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"To me.\n"+
		"REIGNIER\n"+
		"Suffolk, what remedy?\n"+
		"I am a soldier, and unapt to weep,\n"+
		"Or to exclaim on fortune's fickleness.\n"+
		"SU FFOLK\n"+
		"Yes, there is remedy enough, my lord:\n"+
		"Consent, and for thy honour give consent,\n"+
		"Thy daughter shall be wedded to my king;\n"+
		"Whom I with pain have woo'd and won thereto;\n"+
		"And this her easy-held imprisonment\n"+
		"Hath gained thy daughter princely liberty.\n"+
		"REIGNIER\n"+
		"Speaks Suffolk as he thinks?\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Fair Margaret knows\n"+
		"That Suffolk doth not flatter, face, or feign.\n"+
		"REIGNIER\n"+
		"Upon thy princely warrant, I descend\n"+
		"To give thee answer of thy just demand.\n"+
		"Exit from the walls\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"And here I will expect thy coming.\n"+
		"Trumpets sound. Enter REIGNIER, below\n"+
		"REIGNIER\n"+
		"Welcome, brave earl, into our territories:\n"+
		"Command in Anjou what your honour pleases.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Thanks, Reignier, happy for so sweet a child,\n"+
		"Fit to be made companion with a king:\n"+
		"What answer makes your grace unto my suit?\n"+
		"REIGNIER\n"+
		"Since thou dost deign to woo her little worth\n"+
		"To be the princely bride of such a lord;\n"+
		"Upon condition I may quietly\n"+
		"Enjoy mine own, the country Maine and Anjou,\n"+
		"Free from oppression or the stroke of war,\n"+
		"My daughter shall be Henry's, if he please.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"That is her ransom; I deliver her;\n"+
		"And those two counties I will undertake\n"+
		"Your grace shall well and quietly enjoy.\n"+
		"REIGNIER\n"+
		"And I again, in Henry's royal name,\n"+
		"As deputy unto that gracious king,\n"+
		"Give thee her hand, for sign of plighted faith.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Reignier of France, I give thee kingly thanks,\n"+
		"Because this is in traffic of a king.\n"+
		"Aside\n"+
		"And yet, methinks, I could be well content\n"+
		"To be mine own attorney in this case.\n"+
		"I'll over then to England with this news,\n"+
		"And make this marriage to be solemnized.\n"+
		"So farewell, Reignier: set this diamond safe\n"+
		"In golden palaces, as it becomes.\n"+
		"REIGNIER\n"+
		"I do embrace thee, as I would embrace\n"+
		"The Christian prince, King Henry, were he here.\n"+
		"MARGARET\n"+
		"Farewell, my lord: good wishes, praise and prayers\n"+
		"Shall Suffolk ever have of Margaret.\n"+
		"Going\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Farewell, sweet madam: but hark you, Margaret;\n"+
		"No princely commendations to my king?\n"+
		"MARGARET\n"+
		"Such commendations as becomes a maid,\n"+
		"A virgin and his servant, say to him.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Words sweetly placed and modestly directed.\n"+
		"But madam, I must trouble you again;\n"+
		"No loving token to his majesty?\n"+
		"MARGARET\n"+
		"Yes, my good lord, a pure unspotted heart,\n"+
		"Never yet taint with love, I send the king.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"And this withal.\n"+
		"Kisses her\n"+
		"MARGARET\n"+
		"That for thyself: I will not so presume\n"+
		"To send such peevish tokens to a king.\n"+
		"Exeunt REIGNIER and MARGARET\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"O, wert thou for myself! But, Suffolk, stay;\n"+
		"Thou mayst not wander in that labyrinth;\n"+
		"There Minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk.\n"+
		"Solicit Henry with her wondrous praise:\n"+
		"Bethink thee on her virtues that surmount,\n"+
		"And natural graces that extinguish art;\n"+
		"Repeat their semblance often on the seas,\n"+
		"That, when thou comest to kneel at Henry's feet,\n"+
		"Thou mayst bereave him of his wits with wonder.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE IV. Camp of the YORK in Anjou.\n"+

		"She and the Dauphin have been juggling:\n"+

		"Lord regent, I do greet your excellence\n"+
		"With letters of commission from the king.\n"+
		"For know, my lords, the states of Christendom,\n"+
		"Moved with remorse of these outrageous broils,\n"+
		"Have earnestly implored a general peace\n"+
		"Betwixt our nation and the aspiring French;\n"+
		"And here at hand the Dauphin and his train\n"+
		"Approacheth, to confer about some matter.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"Is all our travail turn'd to this effect?\n"+
		"After the slaughter of so many peers,\n"+
		"So many captains, gentlemen and soldiers,\n"+
		"That in this quarrel have been overthrown\n"+
		"And sold their bodies for their country's benefit,\n"+
		"Shall we at last conclude effeminate peace?\n"+
		"Have we not lost most part of all the towns,\n"+
		"By treason, falsehood and by treachery,\n"+
		"Our great progenitors had conquered?\n"+
		"O Warwick, Warwick! I foresee with grief\n"+
		"The utter loss of all the realm of France.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Be patient, York: if we conclude a peace,\n"+
		"It shall be with such strict and severe covenants\n"+
		"As little shall the Frenchmen gain thereby.\n"+
		"Enter CHARLES, ALENCON, BASTARD OF ORLEANS, REIGNIER, and others\n"+
		"CHARLES\n"+
		"Since, lords of England, it is thus agreed\n"+
		"That peaceful truce shall be proclaim'd in France,\n"+
		"We come to be informed by yourselves\n"+
		"What the conditions of that league must be.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"Speak, Winchester; for boiling choler chokes\n"+
		"The hollow passage of my poison'd voice,\n"+
		"By sight of these our baleful enemies.\n"+
		"CARDINAL\n"+
		"OF WINCHESTER\n"+
		"Charles, and the rest, it is enacted thus:\n"+
		"That, in regard King Henry gives consent,\n"+
		"Of mere compassion and of lenity,\n"+
		"To ease your country of distressful war,\n"+
		"And suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace,\n"+
		"You shall become true liegemen to his crown:\n"+
		"And Charles, upon condition thou wilt swear\n"+
		"To pay him tribute, submit thyself,\n"+
		"Thou shalt be placed as viceroy under him,\n"+
		"And still enjoy thy regal dignity.\n"+
		"ALENCON\n"+
		"Must he be then as shadow of himself?\n"+
		"Adorn his temples with a coronet,\n"+
		"And yet, in substance and authority,\n"+
		"Retain but privilege of a private man?\n"+
		"This proffer is absurd and reasonless.\n"+
		"CHARLES\n"+
		"'Tis known already that I am possess'd\n"+
		"With more than half the Gallian territories,\n"+
		"And therein reverenced for their lawful king:\n"+
		"Shall I, for lucre of the rest unvanquish'd,\n"+
		"Detract so much from that prerogative,\n"+
		"As to be call'd but viceroy of the whole?\n"+
		"No, lord ambassador, I'll rather keep\n"+
		"That which I have than, coveting for more,\n"+
		"Be cast from possibility of all.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"Insulting Charles! hast thou by secret means\n"+
		"Used intercession to obtain a league,\n"+
		"And, now the matter grows to compromise,\n"+
		"Stand'st thou aloof upon comparison?\n"+
		"Either accept the title thou usurp'st,\n"+
		"Of benefit proceeding from our king\n"+
		"And not of any challenge of desert,\n"+
		"Or we will plague thee with incessant wars.\n"+
		"REIGNIER\n"+
		"My lord, you do not well in obstinacy\n"+
		"To cavil in the course of this contract:\n"+
		"If once it be neglected, ten to one\n"+
		"We shall not find like opportunity.\n"+
		"ALENCON\n"+
		"To say the truth, it is your policy\n"+
		"To save your subjects from such massacre\n"+
		"And ruthless slaughters as are daily seen\n"+
		"By our proceeding in hostility;\n"+
		"And therefore take this compact of a truce,\n"+
		"Although you break it when your pleasure serves.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"How say'st thou, Charles? shall our condition stand?\n"+
		"CHARLES\n"+
		"It shall;\n"+
		"Only reserved, you claim no interest\n"+
		"In any of our towns of garrison.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"Then swear allegiance to his majesty,\n"+
		"As thou art knight, never to disobey\n"+
		"Nor be rebellious to the crown of England,\n"+
		"Thou, nor thy nobles, to the crown of England.\n"+
		"So, now dismiss your army when ye please:\n"+
		"Hang up your ensign, let your drums be still,\n"+
		"For here we entertain a solemn peace.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE V. London. The palace.\n"+
		"Enter SUFFOLK in conference with KING HENRY VI, GLOUCESTER and EXETER\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Your wondrous rare description, noble earl,\n"+
		"Of beauteous Margaret hath astonish'd me:\n"+
		"Her virtues graced with external gifts\n"+
		"Do breed love's settled passions in my heart:\n"+
		"And like as rigor of tempestuous gusts\n"+
		"Provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide,\n"+
		"So am I driven by breath of her renown\n"+
		"Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive\n"+
		"Where I may have fruition of her love.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Tush, my good lord, this superficial tale\n"+
		"Is but a preface of her worthy praise;\n"+
		"The chief perfections of that lovely dame\n"+
		"Had I sufficient skill to utter them,\n"+
		"Would make a volume of enticing lines,\n"+
		"Able to ravish any dull conceit:\n"+
		"And, which is more, she is not so divine,\n"+
		"So full-replete with choice of all delights,\n"+
		"But with as humble lowliness of mind\n"+
		"She is content to be at your command;\n"+
		"Command, I mean, of virtuous chaste intents,\n"+
		"To love and honour Henry as her lord.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"And otherwise will Henry ne'er presume.\n"+
		"Therefore, my lord protector, give consent\n"+
		"That Margaret may be England's royal queen.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"So should I give consent to flatter sin.\n"+
		"You know, my lord, your highness is betroth'd\n"+
		"Unto another lady of esteem:\n"+
		"How shall we then dispense with that contract,\n"+
		"And not deface your honour with reproach?\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths;\n"+
		"Or one that, at a triumph having vow'd\n"+
		"To try his strength, forsaketh yet the lists\n"+
		"By reason of his adversary's odds:\n"+
		"A poor earl's daughter is unequal odds,\n"+
		"And therefore may be broke without offence.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Why, what, I pray, is Margaret more than that?\n"+
		"Her father is no better than an earl,\n"+
		"Although in glorious titles he excel.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Yes, lord, her father is a king,\n"+
		"The King of Naples and Jerusalem;\n"+
		"And of such great authority in France\n"+
		"As his alliance will confirm our peace\n"+
		"And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"And so the Earl of Armagnac may do,\n"+
		"Because he is near kinsman unto Charles.\n"+
		"EXETER\n"+
		"Beside, his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower,\n"+
		"Where Reignier sooner will receive than give.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"A dower, my lords! disgrace not so your king,\n"+
		"That he should be so abject, base and poor,\n"+
		"To choose for wealth and not for perfect love.\n"+
		"Henry is able to enrich his queen\n"+
		"And not seek a queen to make him rich:\n"+
		"So worthless peasants bargain for their wives,\n"+
		"As market-men for oxen, sheep, or horse.\n"+
		"Marriage is a matter of more worth\n"+
		"Than to be dealt in by attorneyship;\n"+
		"Not whom we will, but whom his grace affects,\n"+
		"Must be companion of his nuptial bed:\n"+
		"And therefore, lords, since he affects her most,\n"+
		"It most of all these reasons bindeth us,\n"+
		"In our opinions she should be preferr'd.\n"+
		"For what is wedlock forced but a hell,\n"+
		"An age of discord and continual strife?\n"+
		"Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss,\n"+
		"And is a pattern of celestial peace.\n"+
		"Whom should we match with Henry, being a king,\n"+
		"But Margaret, that is daughter to a king?\n"+
		"Her peerless feature, joined with her birth,\n"+
		"Approves her fit for none but for a king:\n"+
		"Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit,\n"+
		"More than in women commonly is seen,\n"+
		"Will answer our hope in issue of a king;\n"+
		"For Henry, son unto a conqueror,\n"+
		"Is likely to beget more conquerors,\n"+
		"If with a lady of so high resolve\n"+
		"As is fair Margaret he be link'd in love.\n"+
		"Then yield, my lords; and here conclude with me\n"+
		"That Margaret shall be queen, and none but she.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Whether it be through force of your report,\n"+
		"My noble Lord of Suffolk, or for that\n"+
		"My tender youth was never yet attaint\n"+
		"With any passion of inflaming love,\n"+
		"I cannot tell; but this I am assured,\n"+
		"I feel such sharp dissension in my breast,\n"+
		"Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear,\n"+
		"As I am sick with working of my thoughts.\n"+
		"Take, therefore, shipping; post, my lord, to France;\n"+
		"Agree to any covenants, and procure\n"+
		"That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come\n"+
		"To cross the seas to England and be crown'd\n"+
		"King Henry's faithful and anointed queen:\n"+
		"For your expenses and sufficient charge,\n"+
		"Among the people gather up a tenth.\n"+
		"Be gone, I say; for, till you do return,\n"+
		"I rest perplexed with a thousand cares.\n"+
		"And you, good uncle, banish all offence:\n"+
		"If you do censure me by what you were,\n"+
		"Not what you are, I know it will excuse\n"+
		"This sudden execution of my will.\n"+
		"And so, conduct me where, from company,\n"+
		"I may revolve and ruminate my grief.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Ay, grief, I fear me, both at first and last.\n"+
		"Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EXETER\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Thus Suffolk hath prevail'd; and thus he goes,\n"+
		"As did the youthful Paris once to Greece,\n"+
		"With hope to find the like event in love,\n"+
		"But prosper better than the Trojan did.\n"+
		"Margaret shall now be queen, and rule the king;\n"+
		"But I will rule both her, the king and realm.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"The Second part of King Henry the Sixth\n"+
		"ACT I\n"+
		"SCENE I. London. The palace.\n"+
		"Flourish of trumpets: then hautboys. Enter KING HENRY VI, GLOUCESTER, SALISBURY, WARWICK, and CARDINAL, on the one side; QUEEN MARGARET, SUFFOLK, YORK, SOMERSET, and BUCKINGHAM, on the other\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"As by your high imperial majesty\n"+
		"I had in charge at my depart for France,\n"+
		"As procurator to your excellence,\n"+
		"To marry Princess Margaret for your grace,\n"+
		"So, in the famous ancient city, Tours,\n"+
		"In presence of the Kings of France and Sicil,\n"+
		"The Dukes of Orleans, Calaber, Bretagne and Alencon,\n"+
		"Seven earls, twelve barons and twenty reverend bishops,\n"+
		"I have perform'd my task and was espoused:\n"+
		"And humbly now upon my bended knee,\n"+
		"In sight of England and her lordly peers,\n"+
		"Deliver up my title in the queen\n"+
		"To your most gracious hands, that are the substance\n"+
		"Of that great shadow I did represent;\n"+
		"The happiest gift that ever marquess gave,\n"+
		"The fairest queen that ever king received.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Suffolk, arise. Welcome, Queen Margaret:\n"+
		"I can express no kinder sign of love\n"+
		"Than this kind kiss. O Lord, that lends me life,\n"+
		"Lend me a heart replete with thankfulness!\n"+
		"For thou hast given me in this beauteous face\n"+
		"A world of earthly blessings to my soul,\n"+
		"If sympathy of love unite our thoughts.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Great King of England and my gracious lord,\n"+
		"The mutual conference that my mind hath had,\n"+
		"By day, by night, waking and in my dreams,\n"+
		"In courtly company or at my beads,\n"+
		"With you, mine alder-liefest sovereign,\n"+
		"Makes me the bolder to salute my king\n"+
		"With ruder terms, such as my wit affords\n"+
		"And over-joy of heart doth minister.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Her sight did ravish; but her grace in speech,\n"+
		"Her words y-clad with wisdom's majesty,\n"+
		"Makes me from wondering fall to weeping joys;\n"+
		"Such is the fulness of my heart's content.\n"+
		"Lords, with one cheerful voice welcome my love.\n"+

		"Lets the paper fall\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Uncle, how now!\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Pardon me, gracious lord;\n"+
		"Some sudden qualm hath struck me at the heart\n"+
		"And dimm'd mine eyes, that I can read no further.\n"+

		"[Reads] 'Item, It is further agreed between them,\n"+

		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"They please us well. Lord marquess, kneel down:\n"+
		"We here create thee the first duke of Suffolk,\n"+

		"Did he so often lodge in open field,\n"+
		"In winter's cold and summer's parching heat,\n"+
		"To conquer France, his true inheritance?\n"+
		"And did my brother Bedford toil his wits,\n"+
		"To keep by policy what Henry got?\n"+
		"Have you yourselves, Somerset, Buckingham,\n"+
		"Brave York, Salisbury, and victorious Warwick,\n"+
		"Received deep scars in France and Normandy?\n"+
		"Or hath mine uncle Beaufort and myself,\n"+
		"With all the learned council of the realm,\n"+
		"Studied so long, sat in the council-house\n"+
		"Early and late, debating to and fro\n"+
		"How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe,\n"+

		"Shall Henry's conquest, Bedford's vigilance,\n"+
		"Your deeds of war and all our counsel die?\n"+
		"O peers of England, shameful is this league!\n"+

		"And our King Henry gives away his own,\n"+
		"To match with her that brings no vantages.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"A proper jest, and never heard before,\n"+

		"I never saw but Humphrey Duke of Gloucester\n"+
		"Did bear him like a noble gentleman.\n"+
		"Oft have I seen the haughty cardinal,\n"+
		"More like a soldier than a man o' the church,\n"+
		"As stout and proud as he were lord of all,\n"+
		"Swear like a ruffian and demean himself\n"+
		"Unlike the ruler of a commonweal.\n"+

		"And shakes his head and trembling stands aloof,\n"+

		"A day will come when York shall claim his own;\n"+
		"And therefore I will take the Nevils' parts\n"+
		"And make a show of love to proud Duke Humphrey,\n"+
		"And, when I spy advantage, claim the crown,\n"+
		"For that's the golden mark I seek to hit:\n"+
		"Nor shall proud Lancaster usurp my right,\n"+
		"Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist,\n"+
		"Nor wear the diadem upon his head,\n"+
		"Whose church-like humours fits not for a crown.\n"+
		"Then, York, be still awhile, till time do serve:\n"+

		"To pry into the secrets of the state;\n"+
		"Till Henry, surfeiting in joys of love,\n"+

		"Why droops my lord, like over-ripen'd corn,\n"+
		"Hanging the head at Ceres' plenteous load?\n"+
		"Why doth the great Duke Humphrey knit his brows,\n"+
		"As frowning at the favours of the world?\n"+
		"Why are thine eyes fixed to the sullen earth,\n"+
		"Gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight?\n"+
		"What seest thou there? King Henry's diadem,\n"+
		"Enchased with all the honours of the world?\n"+
		"If so, gaze on, and grovel on thy face,\n"+
		"Until thy head be circled with the same.\n"+
		"Put forth thy hand, reach at the glorious gold.\n"+
		"What, is't too short? I'll lengthen it with mine:\n"+
		"And, having both together heaved it up,\n"+
		"We'll both together lift our heads to heaven,\n"+
		"And never more abase our sight so low\n"+
		"As to vouchsafe one glance unto the ground.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"O Nell, sweet Nell, if thou dost love thy lord,\n"+
		"Banish the canker of ambitious thoughts.\n"+
		"And may that thought, when I imagine ill\n"+

		"Be my last breathing in this mortal world!\n"+
		"My troublous dream this night doth make me sad.\n"+
		"DUCHESS\n"+
		"What dream'd my lord? tell me, and I'll requite it\n"+
		"With sweet rehearsal of my morning's dream.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Methought this staff, mine office-badge in court,\n"+
		"Was broke in twain; by whom I have forgot,\n"+
		"But, as I think, it was by the cardinal;\n"+
		"And on the pieces of the broken wand\n"+
		"Were placed the heads of Edmund Duke of Somerset,\n"+
		"And William de la Pole, first duke of Suffolk.\n"+
		"This was my dream: what it doth bode, God knows.\n"+
		"DUCHESS\n"+
		"Tut, this was nothing but an argument\n"+
		"That he that breaks a stick of Gloucester's grove\n"+
		"Shall lose his head for his presumption.\n"+
		"But list to me, my Humphrey, my sweet duke:\n"+
		"Methought I sat in seat of majesty\n"+
		"In the cathedral church of Westminster,\n"+
		"And in that chair where kings and queens are crown'd;\n"+
		"Where Henry and dame Margaret kneel'd to me\n"+
		"And on my head did set the diadem.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Nay, Eleanor, then must I chide outright:\n"+
		"Presumptuous dame, ill-nurtured Eleanor,\n"+
		"Art thou not second woman in the realm,\n"+
		"And the protector's wife, beloved of him?\n"+
		"Hast thou not worldly pleasure at command,\n"+
		"Above the reach or compass of thy thought?\n"+
		"And wilt thou still be hammering treachery,\n"+
		"To tumble down thy husband and thyself\n"+
		"From top of honour to disgrace's feet?\n"+
		"Away from me, and let me hear no more!\n"+
		"DUCHESS\n"+
		"What, what, my lord! are you so choleric\n"+
		"With Eleanor, for telling but her dream?\n"+
		"Next time I'll keep my dreams unto myself,\n"+
		"And not be cheque'd.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Nay, be not angry; I am pleased again.\n"+
		"Enter Messenger\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"My lord protector, 'tis his highness' pleasure\n"+
		"You do prepare to ride unto Saint Alban's,\n"+
		"Where as the king and queen do mean to hawk.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"I go. Come, Nell, thou wilt ride with us?\n"+
		"DUCHESS\n"+
		"Yes, my good lord, I'll follow presently.\n"+
		"Exeunt GLOUCESTER and Messenger\n"+
		"Follow I must; I cannot go before,\n"+
		"While Gloucester bears this base and humble mind.\n"+
		"Were I a man, a duke, and next of blood,\n"+
		"I would remove these tedious stumbling-blocks\n"+
		"And smooth my way upon their headless necks;\n"+
		"And, being a woman, I will not be slack\n"+
		"To play my part in Fortune's pageant.\n"+
		"Where are you there? Sir John! nay, fear not, man,\n"+
		"We are alone; here's none but thee and I.\n"+

		"HUME\n"+
		"Jesus preserve your royal majesty!\n"+

		"But, by the grace of God, and Hume's advice,\n"+
		"Your grace's title shall be multiplied.\n"+
		"DUCHESS\n"+
		"What say'st thou, man? hast thou as yet conferr'd\n"+

		"A spirit raised from depth of under-ground,\n"+
		"That shall make answer to such questions\n"+
		"As by your grace shall be propounded him.\n"+
		"DUCHESS\n"+
		"It is enough; I'll think upon the questions:\n"+
		"When from St. Alban's we do make return,\n"+
		"We'll see these things effected to the full.\n"+
		"Here, Hume, take this reward; make merry, man,\n"+
		"With thy confederates in this weighty cause.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"HUME\n"+
		"Hume must make merry with the duchess' gold;\n"+
		"Marry, and shall. But how now, Sir John Hume!\n"+
		"Seal up your lips, and give no words but mum:\n"+
		"The business asketh silent secrecy.\n"+
		"Dame Eleanor gives gold to bring the witch:\n"+
		"Gold cannot come amiss, were she a devil.\n"+
		"Yet have I gold flies from another coast;\n"+
		"I dare not say, from the rich cardinal\n"+
		"And from the great and new-made Duke of Suffolk,\n"+
		"Yet I do find it so; for to be plain,\n"+
		"They, knowing Dame Eleanor's aspiring humour,\n"+
		"Have hired me to undermine the duchess\n"+
		"And buz these conjurations in her brain.\n"+
		"They say 'A crafty knave does need no broker;'\n"+
		"Yet am I Suffolk and the cardinal's broker.\n"+
		"Hume, if you take not heed, you shall go near\n"+
		"To call them both a pair of crafty knaves.\n"+
		"Well, so it stands; and thus, I fear, at last\n"+
		"Hume's knavery will be the duchess' wreck,\n"+
		"And her attainture will be Humphrey's fall:\n"+
		"Sort how it will, I shall have gold for all.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+

		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"My Lord of Suffolk, say, is this the guise,\n"+

		"What shall King Henry be a pupil still\n"+

		"Am I a queen in title and in style,\n"+
		"And must be made a subject to a duke?\n"+
		"I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours\n"+

		"And stolest away the ladies' hearts of France,\n"+
		"I thought King Henry had resembled thee\n"+
		"In courage, courtship and proportion:\n"+
		"But all his mind is bent to holiness,\n"+
		"To number Ave-Maries on his beads;\n"+
		"His champions are the prophets and apostles,\n"+
		"His weapons holy saws of sacred writ,\n"+
		"His study is his tilt-yard, and his loves\n"+
		"Are brazen images of canonized saints.\n"+
		"I would the college of the cardinals\n"+
		"Would choose him pope, and carry him to Rome,\n"+
		"And set the triple crown upon his head:\n"+
		"That were a state fit for his holiness.\n"+

		"Madam, be patient: as I was cause\n"+
		"Your highness came to England, so will I\n"+
		"In England work your grace's full content.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Beside the haughty protector, have we Beaufort,\n"+
		"The imperious churchman, Somerset, Buckingham,\n"+
		"And grumbling York: and not the least of these\n"+
		"But can do more in England than the king.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"And he of these that can do most of all\n"+
		"Cannot do more in England than the Nevils:\n"+

		"Not all these lords do vex me half so much\n"+
		"As that proud dame, the lord protector's wife.\n"+
		"She sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies,\n"+
		"More like an empress than Duke Humphrey's wife:\n"+
		"Strangers in court do take her for the queen:\n"+
		"She bears a duke's revenues on her back,\n"+
		"And in her heart she scorns our poverty:\n"+
		"Shall I not live to be avenged on her?\n"+
		"Contemptuous base-born callet as she is,\n"+
		"She vaunted 'mongst her minions t'other day,\n"+
		"The very train of her worst wearing gown\n"+
		"Was better worth than all my father's lands,\n"+
		"Till Suffolk gave two dukedoms for his daughter.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Madam, myself have limed a bush for her,\n"+
		"And placed a quire of such enticing birds,\n"+
		"That she will light to listen to the lays,\n"+
		"And never mount to trouble you again.\n"+
		"So, let her rest: and, madam, list to me;\n"+
		"For I am bold to counsel you in this.\n"+
		"Although we fancy not the cardinal,\n"+
		"Yet must we join with him and with the lords,\n"+
		"Till we have brought Duke Humphrey in disgrace.\n"+
		"As for the Duke of York, this late complaint\n"+

		"So, one by one, we'll weed them all at last,\n"+
		"And you yourself shall steer the happy helm.\n"+
		"Sound a sennet. Enter KING HENRY VI, GLOUCESTER, CARDINAL, BUCKINGHAM, YORK, SOMERSET, SALISBURY, WARWICK, and the DUCHESS\n"+

		"For my part, noble lords, I care not which;\n"+
		"Or Somerset or York, all's one to me.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"If York have ill demean'd himself in France,\n"+

		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Whether your grace be worthy, yea or no,\n"+

		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"Peace, son! and show some reason, Buckingham,\n"+
		"Why Somerset should be preferred in this.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Because the king, forsooth, will have it so.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Madam, the king is old enough himself\n"+
		"To give his censure: these are no women's matters.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"If he be old enough, what needs your grace\n"+
		"To be protector of his excellence?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Madam, I am protector of the realm;\n"+
		"And, at his pleasure, will resign my place.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Resign it then and leave thine insolence.\n"+
		"Since thou wert king--as who is king but thou?--\n"+
		"The commonwealth hath daily run to wreck;\n"+
		"The Dauphin hath prevail'd beyond the seas;\n"+
		"And all the peers and nobles of the realm\n"+

		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"They sale of offices and towns in France,\n"+
		"If they were known, as the suspect is great,\n"+
		"Would make thee quickly hop without thy head.\n"+
		"Exit GLOUCESTER. QUEEN MARGARET drops her fan\n"+
		"Give me my fan: what, minion! can ye not?\n"+
		"She gives the DUCHESS a box on the ear\n"+
		"I cry you mercy, madam; was it you?\n"+
		"DUCHESS\n"+
		"Was't I! yea, I it was, proud Frenchwoman:\n"+
		"Could I come near your beauty with my nails,\n"+
		"I'd set my ten commandments in your face.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Sweet aunt, be quiet; 'twas against her will.\n"+
		"DUCHESS\n"+
		"Against her will! good king, look to't in time;\n"+
		"She'll hamper thee, and dandle thee like a baby:\n"+
		"Though in this place most master wear no breeches,\n"+
		"She shall not strike Dame Eleanor unrevenged.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Lord cardinal, I will follow Eleanor,\n"+
		"And listen after Humphrey, how he proceeds:\n"+

		"Re-enter GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Now, lords, my choler being over-blown\n"+
		"With walking once about the quadrangle,\n"+
		"I come to talk of commonwealth affairs.\n"+
		"As for your spiteful false objections,\n"+
		"Prove them, and I lie open to the law:\n"+
		"But God in mercy so deal with my soul,\n"+
		"As I in duty love my king and country!\n"+
		"But, to the matter that we have in hand:\n"+
		"I say, my sovereign, York is meetest man\n"+
		"To be your regent in the realm of France.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Before we make election, give me leave\n"+
		"To show some reason, of no little force,\n"+
		"That York is most unmeet of any man.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"I'll tell thee, Suffolk, why I am unmeet:\n"+
		"First, for I cannot flatter thee in pride;\n"+
		"Next, if I be appointed for the place,\n"+
		"My Lord of Somerset will keep me here,\n"+
		"Without discharge, money, or furniture,\n"+
		"Till France be won into the Dauphin's hands:\n"+
		"Last time, I danced attendance on his will\n"+
		"Till Paris was besieged, famish'd, and lost.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"That can I witness; and a fouler fact\n"+

		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Peace, headstrong Warwick!\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Image of pride, why should I hold my peace?\n"+
		"Enter HORNER, the Armourer, and his man PETER, guarded\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Because here is a man accused of treason:\n"+

		"Doth any one accuse York for a traitor?\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"What mean'st thou, Suffolk; tell me, what are these?\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Please it your majesty, this is the man\n"+
		"That doth accuse his master of high treason:\n"+
		"His words were these: that Richard, Duke of York,\n"+
		"Was rightful heir unto the English crown\n"+
		"And that your majesty was a usurper.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Say, man, were these thy words?\n"+
		"HORNER\n"+
		"An't shall please your majesty, I never said nor\n"+
		"thought any such matter: God is my witness, I am\n"+
		"falsely accused by the villain.\n"+
		"PETER\n"+
		"By these ten bones, my lords, he did speak them to\n"+
		"me in the garret one night, as we were scouring my\n"+
		"Lord of York's armour.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"Base dunghill villain and mechanical,\n"+
		"I'll have thy head for this thy traitor's speech.\n"+

		"Let him have all the rigor of the law.\n"+
		"HORNER\n"+
		"Alas, my lord, hang me, if ever I spake the words.\n"+

		"accusation.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Uncle, what shall we say to this in law?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"This doom, my lord, if I may judge:\n"+
		"Let Somerset be regent over the French,\n"+
		"Because in York this breeds suspicion:\n"+
		"And let these have a day appointed them\n"+
		"For single combat in convenient place,\n"+
		"For he hath witness of his servant's malice:\n"+

		"SOMERSET\n"+
		"I humbly thank your royal majesty.\n"+
		"HORNER\n"+
		"And I accept the combat willingly.\n"+
		"PETER\n"+
		"Alas, my lord, I cannot fight; for God's sake, pity\n"+

		"Believe me, lords, for flying at the brook,\n"+
		"I saw not better sport these seven years' day:\n"+
		"Yet, by your leave, the wind was very high;\n"+
		"And, ten to one, old Joan had not gone out.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"But what a point, my lord, your falcon made,\n"+
		"And what a pitch she flew above the rest!\n"+
		"To see how God in all his creatures works!\n"+
		"Yea, man and birds are fain of climbing high.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"No marvel, an it like your majesty,\n"+

		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"My lord, 'tis but a base ignoble mind\n"+
		"That mounts no higher than a bird can soar.\n"+
		"CARDINAL\n"+

		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Ay, my lord cardinal? how think you by that?\n"+

		"CARDINAL\n"+
		"Believe me, cousin Gloucester,\n"+

		"Enter a Townsman of Saint Alban's, crying 'A miracle!'\n"+

		"Fellow, what miracle dost thou proclaim?\n"+
		"Townsman\n"+
		"A miracle! a miracle!\n"+

		"Come to the king and tell him what miracle.\n"+
		"Townsman\n"+
		"Forsooth, a blind man at Saint Alban's shrine,\n"+
		"Within this half-hour, hath received his sight;\n"+
		"A man that ne'er saw in his life before.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Now, God be praised, that to believing souls\n"+
		"Gives light in darkness, comfort in despair!\n"+
		"Enter the Mayor of Saint Alban's and his brethren, bearing SIMPCOX, between two in a chair, SIMPCOX's Wife following\n"+
		"CARDINAL\n"+
		"Here comes the townsmen on procession,\n"+
		"To present your highness with the man.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Great is his comfort in this earthly vale,\n"+
		"Although by his sight his sin be multiplied.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Stand by, my masters: bring him near the king;\n"+
		"His highness' pleasure is to talk with him.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Good fellow, tell us here the circumstance,\n"+
		"That we for thee may glorify the Lord.\n"+
		"What, hast thou been long blind and now restored?\n"+
		"SIMPCOX\n"+
		"Born blind, an't please your grace.\n"+
		"Wife\n"+
		"Ay, indeed, was he.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"What woman is this?\n"+
		"Wife\n"+
		"His wife, an't like your worship.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Hadst thou been his mother, thou couldst have\n"+
		"better told.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Where wert thou born?\n"+
		"SIMPCOX\n"+
		"At Berwick in the north, an't like your grace.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Poor soul, God's goodness hath been great to thee:\n"+
		"Let never day nor night unhallow'd pass,\n"+
		"But still remember what the Lord hath done.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Tell me, good fellow, camest thou here by chance,\n"+
		"Or of devotion, to this holy shrine?\n"+
		"SIMPCOX\n"+
		"God knows, of pure devotion; being call'd\n"+
		"A hundred times and oftener, in my sleep,\n"+
		"By good Saint Alban; who said, 'Simpcox, come,\n"+
		"Come, offer at my shrine, and I will help thee.'\n"+
		"Wife\n"+
		"Most true, forsooth; and many time and oft\n"+
		"Myself have heard a voice to call him so.\n"+
		"CARDINAL\n"+
		"What, art thou lame?\n"+
		"SIMPCOX\n"+
		"Ay, God Almighty help me!\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"How camest thou so?\n"+
		"SIMPCOX\n"+
		"A fall off of a tree.\n"+
		"Wife\n"+
		"A plum-tree, master.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"How long hast thou been blind?\n"+
		"SIMPCOX\n"+
		"Born so, master.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"What, and wouldst climb a tree?\n"+
		"SIMPCOX\n"+
		"But that in all my life, when I was a youth.\n"+
		"Wife\n"+
		"Too true; and bought his climbing very dear.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Mass, thou lovedst plums well, that wouldst\n"+
		"venture so.\n"+
		"SIMPCOX\n"+
		"Alas, good master, my wife desired some damsons,\n"+
		"And made me climb, with danger of my life.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"A subtle knave! but yet it shall not serve.\n"+
		"Let me see thine eyes: wink now: now open them:\n"+
		"In my opinion yet thou seest not well.\n"+
		"SIMPCOX\n"+
		"Yes, master, clear as day, I thank God and\n"+
		"Saint Alban.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Say'st thou me so? What colour is this cloak of?\n"+
		"SIMPCOX\n"+
		"Red, master; red as blood.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Why, that's well said. What colour is my gown of?\n"+
		"SIMPCOX\n"+
		"Black, forsooth: coal-black as jet.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Why, then, thou know'st what colour jet is of?\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"And yet, I think, jet did he never see.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"But cloaks and gowns, before this day, a many.\n"+
		"Wife\n"+
		"Never, before this day, in all his life.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Tell me, sirrah, what's my name?\n"+
		"SIMPCOX\n"+
		"Alas, master, I know not.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"What's his name?\n"+
		"SIMPCOX\n"+
		"I know not.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Nor his?\n"+
		"SIMPCOX\n"+
		"No, indeed, master.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"What's thine own name?\n"+
		"SIMPCOX\n"+
		"Saunder Simpcox, an if it please you, master.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Then, Saunder, sit there, the lyingest knave in\n"+
		"Christendom. If thou hadst been born blind, thou\n"+
		"mightest as well have known all our names as thus to\n"+
		"name the several colours we do wear. Sight may\n"+
		"distinguish of colours, but suddenly to nominate them\n"+
		"all, it is impossible. My lords, Saint Alban here\n"+
		"hath done a miracle; and would ye not think his\n"+
		"cunning to be great, that could restore this cripple\n"+
		"to his legs again?\n"+
		"SIMPCOX\n"+
		"O master, that you could!\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"My masters of Saint Alban's, have you not beadles in\n"+
		"your town, and things called whips?\n"+
		"Mayor\n"+
		"Yes, my lord, if it please your grace.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Then send for one presently.\n"+
		"Mayor\n"+
		"Sirrah, go fetch the beadle hither straight.\n"+
		"Exit an Attendant\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Now fetch me a stool hither by and by. Now, sirrah,\n"+
		"if you mean to save yourself from whipping, leap me\n"+
		"over this stool and run away.\n"+
		"SIMPCOX\n"+
		"Alas, master, I am not able to stand alone:\n"+
		"You go about to torture me in vain.\n"+
		"Enter a Beadle with whips\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Well, sir, we must have you find your legs. Sirrah\n"+
		"beadle, whip him till he leap over that same stool.\n"+
		"Beadle\n"+
		"I will, my lord. Come on, sirrah; off with your\n"+
		"doublet quickly.\n"+
		"SIMPCOX\n"+
		"Alas, master, what shall I do? I am not able to stand.\n"+
		"After the Beadle hath hit him once, he leaps over the stool and runs away; and they follow and cry, 'A miracle!'\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"O God, seest Thou this, and bearest so long?\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"It made me laugh to see the villain run.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Follow the knave; and take this drab away.\n"+
		"Wife\n"+
		"Alas, sir, we did it for pure need.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Let them be whipped through every market-town, till\n"+
		"they come to Berwick, from whence they came.\n"+
		"Exeunt Wife, Beadle, Mayor, & c\n"+

		"Duke Humphrey has done a miracle to-day.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"True; made the lame to leap and fly away.\n"+

		"But you have done more miracles than I;\n"+
		"You made in a day, my lord, whole towns to fly.\n"+
		"Enter BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"What tidings with our cousin Buckingham?\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Such as my heart doth tremble to unfold.\n"+
		"A sort of naughty persons, lewdly bent,\n"+
		"Under the countenance and confederacy\n"+
		"Of Lady Eleanor, the protector's wife,\n"+
		"The ringleader and head of all this rout,\n"+
		"Have practised dangerously against your state,\n"+
		"Dealing with witches and with conjurers:\n"+
		"Whom we have apprehended in the fact;\n"+
		"Raising up wicked spirits from under ground,\n"+
		"Demanding of King Henry's life and death,\n"+
		"And other of your highness' privy-council;\n"+
		"As more at large your grace shall understand.\n"+
		"CARDINAL\n"+
		"[Aside to GLOUCESTER] And so, my lord protector,\n"+
		"by this means\n"+

		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Ambitious churchman, leave to afflict my heart:\n"+
		"Sorrow and grief have vanquish'd all my powers;\n"+

		"And look thyself be faultless, thou wert best.\n"+

		"Madam, for myself, to heaven I do appeal,\n"+
		"How I have loved my king and commonweal:\n"+
		"And, for my wife, I know not how it stands;\n"+
		"Sorry I am to hear what I have heard:\n"+
		"Noble she is, but if she have forgot\n"+
		"Honour and virtue and conversed with such\n"+
		"As, like to pitch, defile nobility,\n"+
		"I banish her my bed and company\n"+
		"And give her as a prey to law and shame,\n"+
		"That hath dishonour'd Gloucester's honest name.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Well, for this night we will repose us here:\n"+
		"To-morrow toward London back again,\n"+
		"To look into this business thoroughly\n"+
		"And call these foul offenders to their answers\n"+
		"And poise the cause in justice' equal scales,\n"+
		"Whose beam stands sure, whose rightful cause prevails.\n"+
		"Flourish. Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. London. YORK'S garden.\n"+
		"Enter YORK, SALISBURY, and WARWICK\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"Now, my good Lords of Salisbury and Warwick,\n"+
		"Our simple supper ended, give me leave\n"+
		"In this close walk to satisfy myself,\n"+
		"In craving your opinion of my title,\n"+
		"Which is infallible, to England's crown.\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"My lord, I long to hear it at full.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Sweet York, begin: and if thy claim be good,\n"+
		"The Nevils are thy subjects to command.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"Then thus:\n"+
		"Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:\n"+
		"The first, Edward the Black Prince, Prince of Wales;\n"+
		"The second, William of Hatfield, and the third,\n"+
		"Lionel Duke of Clarence: next to whom\n"+
		"Was John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster;\n"+
		"The fifth was Edmund Langley, Duke of York;\n"+
		"The sixth was Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester;\n"+
		"William of Windsor was the seventh and last.\n"+
		"Edward the Black Prince died before his father\n"+
		"And left behind him Richard, his only son,\n"+
		"Who after Edward the Third's death reign'd as king;\n"+
		"Till Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster,\n"+
		"The eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt,\n"+
		"Crown'd by the name of Henry the Fourth,\n"+
		"Seized on the realm, deposed the rightful king,\n"+
		"Sent his poor queen to France, from whence she came,\n"+
		"And him to Pomfret; where, as all you know,\n"+
		"Harmless Richard was murder'd traitorously.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Father, the duke hath told the truth:\n"+
		"Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"Which now they hold by force and not by right;\n"+
		"For Richard, the first son's heir, being dead,\n"+
		"The issue of the next son should have reign'd.\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"But William of Hatfield died without an heir.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"The third son, Duke of Clarence, from whose line\n"+
		"I claimed the crown, had issue, Philippe, a daughter,\n"+
		"Who married Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March:\n"+
		"Edmund had issue, Roger Earl of March;\n"+
		"Roger had issue, Edmund, Anne and Eleanor.\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"This Edmund, in the reign of Bolingbroke,\n"+
		"As I have read, laid claim unto the crown;\n"+
		"And, but for Owen Glendower, had been king,\n"+
		"Who kept him in captivity till he died.\n"+
		"But to the rest.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"His eldest sister, Anne,\n"+
		"My mother, being heir unto the crown\n"+
		"Married Richard Earl of Cambridge; who was son\n"+
		"To Edmund Langley, Edward the Third's fifth son.\n"+
		"By her I claim the kingdom: she was heir\n"+
		"To Roger Earl of March, who was the son\n"+
		"Of Edmund Mortimer, who married Philippe,\n"+
		"Sole daughter unto Lionel Duke of Clarence:\n"+
		"So, if the issue of the elder son\n"+
		"Succeed before the younger, I am king.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"What plain proceeding is more plain than this?\n"+
		"Henry doth claim the crown from John of Gaunt,\n"+
		"The fourth son; York claims it from the third.\n"+
		"Till Lionel's issue fails, his should not reign:\n"+
		"It fails not yet, but flourishes in thee\n"+
		"And in thy sons, fair slips of such a stock.\n"+
		"Then, father Salisbury, kneel we together;\n"+
		"And in this private plot be we the first\n"+
		"That shall salute our rightful sovereign\n"+
		"With honour of his birthright to the crown.\n"+
		"BOTH\n"+
		"Long live our sovereign Richard, England's king!\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"We thank you, lords. But I am not your king\n"+
		"Till I be crown'd and that my sword be stain'd\n"+
		"With heart-blood of the house of Lancaster;\n"+
		"And that's not suddenly to be perform'd,\n"+
		"But with advice and silent secrecy.\n"+
		"Do you as I do in these dangerous days:\n"+
		"Wink at the Duke of Suffolk's insolence,\n"+
		"At Beaufort's pride, at Somerset's ambition,\n"+
		"At Buckingham and all the crew of them,\n"+
		"Till they have snared the shepherd of the flock,\n"+
		"That virtuous prince, the good Duke Humphrey:\n"+
		"'Tis that they seek, and they in seeking that\n"+
		"Shall find their deaths, if York can prophesy.\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"My lord, break we off; we know your mind at full.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"My heart assures me that the Earl of Warwick\n"+
		"Shall one day make the Duke of York a king.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"And, Nevil, this I do assure myself:\n"+
		"Richard shall live to make the Earl of Warwick\n"+
		"The greatest man in England but the king.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. A hall of justice.\n"+
		"Sound trumpets. Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN MARGARET, GLOUCESTER, YORK, SUFFOLK, and SALISBURY; the DUCHESS, MARGARET JOURDAIN, SOUTHWELL, HUME, and BOLINGBROKE, under guard\n"+

		"Stand forth, Dame Eleanor Cobham, Gloucester's wife:\n"+
		"In sight of God and us, your guilt is great:\n"+

		"Eleanor, the law, thou see'st, hath judged thee:\n"+

		"Exeunt DUCHESS and other prisoners, guarded\n"+
		"Mine eyes are full of tears, my heart of grief.\n"+
		"Ah, Humphrey, this dishonour in thine age\n"+
		"Will bring thy head with sorrow to the ground!\n"+
		"I beseech your majesty, give me leave to go;\n"+
		"Sorrow would solace and mine age would ease.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Stay, Humphrey Duke of Gloucester: ere thou go,\n"+
		"Give up thy staff: Henry will to himself\n"+
		"Protector be; and God shall be my hope,\n"+
		"My stay, my guide and lantern to my feet:\n"+
		"And go in peace, Humphrey, no less beloved\n"+
		"Than when thou wert protector to thy King.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"I see no reason why a king of years\n"+
		"Should be to be protected like a child.\n"+
		"God and King Henry govern England's realm.\n"+
		"Give up your staff, sir, and the king his realm.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"My staff? here, noble Henry, is my staff:\n"+
		"As willingly do I the same resign\n"+
		"As e'er thy father Henry made it mine;\n"+
		"And even as willingly at thy feet I leave it\n"+
		"As others would ambitiously receive it.\n"+
		"Farewell, good king: when I am dead and gone,\n"+
		"May honourable peace attend thy throne!\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Why, now is Henry king, and Margaret queen;\n"+
		"And Humphrey Duke of Gloucester scarce himself,\n"+
		"That bears so shrewd a maim; two pulls at once;\n"+
		"His lady banish'd, and a limb lopp'd off.\n"+
		"This staff of honour raught, there let it stand\n"+
		"Where it best fits to be, in Henry's hand.\n"+

		"YORK\n"+
		"Lords, let him go. Please it your majesty,\n"+
		"This is the day appointed for the combat;\n"+
		"And ready are the appellant and defendant,\n"+
		"The armourer and his man, to enter the lists,\n"+
		"So please your highness to behold the fight.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Ay, good my lord; for purposely therefore\n"+
		"Left I the court, to see this quarrel tried.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"O God's name, see the lists and all things fit:\n"+
		"Here let them end it; and God defend the right!\n"+

		"Enter at one door, HORNER, the Armourer, and his Neighbours, drinking to him so much that he is drunk; and he enters with a drum before him and his staff with a sand-bag fastened to it; and at the other door PETER, his man, with a drum and sand-bag, and 'Prentices drinking to him\n"+

		"HORNER\n"+
		"Masters, I am come hither, as it were, upon my man's\n"+

		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Thus sometimes hath the brightest day a cloud;\n"+

		"To tread them with her tender-feeling feet.\n"+
		"Sweet Nell, ill can thy noble mind abrook\n"+
		"The abject people gazing on thy face,\n"+
		"With envious looks, laughing at thy shame,\n"+
		"That erst did follow thy proud chariot-wheels\n"+
		"When thou didst ride in triumph through the streets.\n"+
		"But, soft! I think she comes; and I'll prepare\n"+
		"My tear-stain'd eyes to see her miseries.\n"+
		"Enter the DUCHESS in a white sheet, and a taper burning in her hand; with STANLEY, the Sheriff, and Officers\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"So please your grace, we'll take her from the sheriff.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"No, stir not, for your lives; let her pass by.\n"+
		"DUCHESS\n"+
		"Come you, my lord, to see my open shame?\n"+
		"Now thou dost penance too. Look how they gaze!\n"+
		"See how the giddy multitude do point,\n"+
		"And nod their heads, and throw their eyes on thee!\n"+
		"Ah, Gloucester, hide thee from their hateful looks,\n"+
		"And, in thy closet pent up, rue my shame,\n"+
		"And ban thine enemies, both mine and thine!\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Be patient, gentle Nell; forget this grief.\n"+
		"DUCHESS\n"+
		"Ah, Gloucester, teach me to forget myself!\n"+
		"For whilst I think I am thy married wife\n"+
		"And thou a prince, protector of this land,\n"+
		"Methinks I should not thus be led along,\n"+
		"Mail'd up in shame, with papers on my back,\n"+
		"And followed with a rabble that rejoice\n"+
		"To see my tears and hear my deep-fet groans.\n"+
		"The ruthless flint doth cut my tender feet,\n"+
		"And when I start, the envious people laugh\n"+
		"And bid me be advised how I tread.\n"+
		"Ah, Humphrey, can I bear this shameful yoke?\n"+
		"Trow'st thou that e'er I'll look upon the world,\n"+
		"Or count them happy that enjoy the sun?\n"+
		"No; dark shall be my light and night my day;\n"+
		"To think upon my pomp shall be my hell.\n"+
		"Sometime I'll say, I am Duke Humphrey's wife,\n"+
		"And he a prince and ruler of the land:\n"+
		"Yet so he ruled and such a prince he was\n"+
		"As he stood by whilst I, his forlorn duchess,\n"+
		"Was made a wonder and a pointing-stock\n"+
		"To every idle rascal follower.\n"+
		"But be thou mild and blush not at my shame,\n"+
		"Nor stir at nothing till the axe of death\n"+
		"Hang over thee, as, sure, it shortly will;\n"+
		"For Suffolk, he that can do all in all\n"+
		"With her that hateth thee and hates us all,\n"+
		"And York and impious Beaufort, that false priest,\n"+
		"Have all limed bushes to betray thy wings,\n"+
		"And, fly thou how thou canst, they'll tangle thee:\n"+
		"But fear not thou, until thy foot be snared,\n"+
		"Nor never seek prevention of thy foes.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Ah, Nell, forbear! thou aimest all awry;\n"+
		"I must offend before I be attainted;\n"+
		"And had I twenty times so many foes,\n"+
		"And each of them had twenty times their power,\n"+
		"All these could not procure me any scathe,\n"+
		"So long as I am loyal, true and crimeless.\n"+
		"Wouldst have me rescue thee from this reproach?\n"+
		"Why, yet thy scandal were not wiped away\n"+
		"But I in danger for the breach of law.\n"+

		"Herald\n"+
		"I summon your grace to his majesty's parliament,\n"+

		"This is close dealing. Well, I will be there.\n"+
		"Exit Herald\n"+
		"My Nell, I take my leave: and, master sheriff,\n"+
		"Let not her penance exceed the king's commission.\n"+
		"Sheriff\n"+
		"An't please your grace, here my commission stays,\n"+
		"And Sir John Stanley is appointed now\n"+
		"To take her with him to the Isle of Man.\n"+

		"Must you, Sir John, protect my lady here?\n"+
		"STANLEY\n"+

		"DUCHESS\n"+
		"What, gone, my lord, and bid me not farewell!\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Witness my tears, I cannot stay to speak.\n"+
		"Exeunt GLOUCESTER and Servingmen\n"+
		"DUCHESS\n"+
		"Art thou gone too? all comfort go with thee!\n"+
		"For none abides with me: my joy is death;\n"+
		"Death, at whose name I oft have been afear'd,\n"+
		"Because I wish'd this world's eternity.\n"+
		"Stanley, I prithee, go, and take me hence;\n"+
		"I care not whither, for I beg no favour,\n"+
		"Only convey me where thou art commanded.\n"+
		"STANLEY\n"+
		"Why, madam, that is to the Isle of Man;\n"+
		"There to be used according to your state.\n"+
		"DUCHESS\n"+
		"That's bad enough, for I am but reproach:\n"+
		"And shall I then be used reproachfully?\n"+
		"STANLEY\n"+
		"Like to a duchess, and Duke Humphrey's lady;\n"+
		"According to that state you shall be used.\n"+
		"DUCHESS\n"+
		"Sheriff, farewell, and better than I fare,\n"+
		"Although thou hast been conduct of my shame.\n"+
		"Sheriff\n"+
		"It is my office; and, madam, pardon me.\n"+
		"DUCHESS\n"+
		"Ay, ay, farewell; thy office is discharged.\n"+
		"Come, Stanley, shall we go?\n"+
		"STANLEY\n"+
		"Madam, your penance done, throw off this sheet,\n"+
		"And go we to attire you for our journey.\n"+
		"DUCHESS\n"+
		"My shame will not be shifted with my sheet:\n"+
		"No, it will hang upon my richest robes\n"+
		"And show itself, attire me how I can.\n"+
		"Go, lead the way; I long to see my prison.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT III\n"+
		"SCENE I. The Abbey at Bury St. Edmund's.\n"+
		"Sound a sennet. Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN MARGARET, CARDINAL, SUFFOLK, YORK, BUCKINGHAM, SALISBURY and WARWICK to the Parliament\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"I muse my Lord of Gloucester is not come:\n"+
		"'Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man,\n"+
		"Whate'er occasion keeps him from us now.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Can you not see? or will ye not observe\n"+
		"The strangeness of his alter'd countenance?\n"+
		"With what a majesty he bears himself,\n"+
		"How insolent of late he is become,\n"+
		"How proud, how peremptory, and unlike himself?\n"+
		"We know the time since he was mild and affable,\n"+
		"And if we did but glance a far-off look,\n"+
		"Immediately he was upon his knee,\n"+
		"That all the court admired him for submission:\n"+
		"But meet him now, and, be it in the morn,\n"+
		"When every one will give the time of day,\n"+
		"He knits his brow and shows an angry eye,\n"+
		"And passeth by with stiff unbowed knee,\n"+
		"Disdaining duty that to us belongs.\n"+
		"Small curs are not regarded when they grin;\n"+
		"But great men tremble when the lion roars;\n"+
		"And Humphrey is no little man in England.\n"+
		"First note that he is near you in descent,\n"+
		"And should you fall, he as the next will mount.\n"+
		"Me seemeth then it is no policy,\n"+
		"Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears\n"+
		"And his advantage following your decease,\n"+
		"That he should come about your royal person\n"+
		"Or be admitted to your highness' council.\n"+
		"By flattery hath he won the commons' hearts,\n"+
		"And when he please to make commotion,\n"+
		"'Tis to be fear'd they all will follow him.\n"+
		"Now 'tis the spring, and weeds are shallow-rooted;\n"+
		"Suffer them now, and they'll o'ergrow the garden\n"+
		"And choke the herbs for want of husbandry.\n"+
		"The reverent care I bear unto my lord\n"+
		"Made me collect these dangers in the duke.\n"+
		"If it be fond, call it a woman's fear;\n"+
		"Which fear if better reasons can supplant,\n"+
		"I will subscribe and say I wrong'd the duke.\n"+
		"My Lord of Suffolk, Buckingham, and York,\n"+
		"Reprove my allegation, if you can;\n"+
		"Or else conclude my words effectual.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Well hath your highness seen into this duke;\n"+
		"And, had I first been put to speak my mind,\n"+
		"I think I should have told your grace's tale.\n"+
		"The duchess, by his subornation,\n"+
		"Upon my life, began her devilish practises:\n"+
		"Or, if he were not privy to those faults,\n"+
		"Yet, by reputing of his high descent,\n"+
		"As next the king he was successive heir,\n"+
		"And such high vaunts of his nobility,\n"+
		"Did instigate the bedlam brain-sick duchess\n"+
		"By wicked means to frame our sovereign's fall.\n"+
		"Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep;\n"+
		"And in his simple show he harbours treason.\n"+
		"The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb.\n"+
		"No, no, my sovereign; Gloucester is a man\n"+
		"Unsounded yet and full of deep deceit.\n"+
		"CARDINAL\n"+
		"Did he not, contrary to form of law,\n"+
		"Devise strange deaths for small offences done?\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"And did he not, in his protectorship,\n"+
		"Levy great sums of money through the realm\n"+
		"For soldiers' pay in France, and never sent it?\n"+
		"By means whereof the towns each day revolted.\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Tut, these are petty faults to faults unknown.\n"+
		"Which time will bring to light in smooth\n"+
		"Duke Humphrey.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"My lords, at once: the care you have of us,\n"+
		"To mow down thorns that would annoy our foot,\n"+
		"Is worthy praise: but, shall I speak my conscience,\n"+
		"Our kinsman Gloucester is as innocent\n"+
		"From meaning treason to our royal person\n"+
		"As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove:\n"+
		"The duke is virtuous, mild and too well given\n"+
		"To dream on evil or to work my downfall.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Ah, what's more dangerous than this fond affiance!\n"+
		"Seems he a dove? his feathers are but borrowed,\n"+
		"For he's disposed as the hateful raven:\n"+
		"Is he a lamb? his skin is surely lent him,\n"+
		"For he's inclined as is the ravenous wolf.\n"+
		"Who cannot steal a shape that means deceit?\n"+
		"Take heed, my lord; the welfare of us all\n"+
		"Hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man.\n"+
		"Enter SOMERSET\n"+
		"SOMERSET\n"+
		"All health unto my gracious sovereign!\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Welcome, Lord Somerset. What news from France?\n"+
		"SOMERSET\n"+
		"That all your interest in those territories\n"+
		"Is utterly bereft you; all is lost.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Cold news, Lord Somerset: but God's will be done!\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"[Aside] Cold news for me; for I had hope of France\n"+
		"As firmly as I hope for fertile England.\n"+
		"Thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud\n"+
		"And caterpillars eat my leaves away;\n"+
		"But I will remedy this gear ere long,\n"+
		"Or sell my title for a glorious grave.\n"+
		"Enter GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"All happiness unto my lord the king!\n"+
		"Pardon, my liege, that I have stay'd so long.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Nay, Gloucester, know that thou art come too soon,\n"+
		"Unless thou wert more loyal than thou art:\n"+
		"I do arrest thee of high treason here.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Well, Suffolk, thou shalt not see me blush\n"+
		"Nor change my countenance for this arrest:\n"+
		"A heart unspotted is not easily daunted.\n"+
		"The purest spring is not so free from mud\n"+
		"As I am clear from treason to my sovereign:\n"+
		"Who can accuse me? wherein am I guilty?\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"'Tis thought, my lord, that you took bribes of France,\n"+
		"And, being protector, stayed the soldiers' pay;\n"+
		"By means whereof his highness hath lost France.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Is it but thought so? what are they that think it?\n"+
		"I never robb'd the soldiers of their pay,\n"+
		"Nor ever had one penny bribe from France.\n"+
		"So help me God, as I have watch'd the night,\n"+
		"Ay, night by night, in studying good for England,\n"+
		"That doit that e'er I wrested from the king,\n"+
		"Or any groat I hoarded to my use,\n"+
		"Be brought against me at my trial-day!\n"+
		"No; many a pound of mine own proper store,\n"+
		"Because I would not tax the needy commons,\n"+
		"Have I disbursed to the garrisons,\n"+
		"And never ask'd for restitution.\n"+
		"CARDINAL\n"+
		"It serves you well, my lord, to say so much.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"I say no more than truth, so help me God!\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"In your protectorship you did devise\n"+
		"Strange tortures for offenders never heard of,\n"+
		"That England was defamed by tyranny.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Why, 'tis well known that, whiles I was\n"+
		"protector,\n"+
		"Pity was all the fault that was in me;\n"+
		"For I should melt at an offender's tears,\n"+
		"And lowly words were ransom for their fault.\n"+
		"Unless it were a bloody murderer,\n"+
		"Or foul felonious thief that fleeced poor passengers,\n"+
		"I never gave them condign punishment:\n"+
		"Murder indeed, that bloody sin, I tortured\n"+
		"Above the felon or what trespass else.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"My lord, these faults are easy, quickly answered:\n"+
		"But mightier crimes are laid unto your charge,\n"+
		"Whereof you cannot easily purge yourself.\n"+
		"I do arrest you in his highness' name;\n"+
		"And here commit you to my lord cardinal\n"+
		"To keep, until your further time of trial.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"My lord of Gloucester, 'tis my special hope\n"+
		"That you will clear yourself from all suspect:\n"+
		"My conscience tells me you are innocent.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Ah, gracious lord, these days are dangerous:\n"+
		"Virtue is choked with foul ambition\n"+
		"And charity chased hence by rancour's hand;\n"+
		"Foul subornation is predominant\n"+
		"And equity exiled your highness' land.\n"+
		"I know their complot is to have my life,\n"+
		"And if my death might make this island happy,\n"+
		"And prove the period of their tyranny,\n"+
		"I would expend it with all willingness:\n"+
		"But mine is made the prologue to their play;\n"+
		"For thousands more, that yet suspect no peril,\n"+
		"Will not conclude their plotted tragedy.\n"+
		"Beaufort's red sparkling eyes blab his heart's malice,\n"+
		"And Suffolk's cloudy brow his stormy hate;\n"+
		"Sharp Buckingham unburthens with his tongue\n"+
		"The envious load that lies upon his heart;\n"+
		"And dogged York, that reaches at the moon,\n"+
		"Whose overweening arm I have pluck'd back,\n"+
		"By false accuse doth level at my life:\n"+
		"And you, my sovereign lady, with the rest,\n"+
		"Causeless have laid disgraces on my head,\n"+
		"And with your best endeavour have stirr'd up\n"+
		"My liefest liege to be mine enemy:\n"+
		"Ay, all you have laid your heads together--\n"+
		"Myself had notice of your conventicles--\n"+
		"And all to make away my guiltless life.\n"+
		"I shall not want false witness to condemn me,\n"+
		"Nor store of treasons to augment my guilt;\n"+
		"The ancient proverb will be well effected:\n"+
		"'A staff is quickly found to beat a dog.'\n"+
		"CARDINAL\n"+
		"My liege, his railing is intolerable:\n"+
		"If those that care to keep your royal person\n"+
		"From treason's secret knife and traitors' rage\n"+
		"Be thus upbraided, chid and rated at,\n"+
		"And the offender granted scope of speech,\n"+
		"'Twill make them cool in zeal unto your grace.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Hath he not twit our sovereign lady here\n"+
		"With ignominious words, though clerkly couch'd,\n"+
		"As if she had suborned some to swear\n"+
		"False allegations to o'erthrow his state?\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"But I can give the loser leave to chide.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Far truer spoke than meant: I lose, indeed;\n"+
		"Beshrew the winners, for they play'd me false!\n"+
		"And well such losers may have leave to speak.\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"He'll wrest the sense and hold us here all day:\n"+
		"Lord cardinal, he is your prisoner.\n"+
		"CARDINAL\n"+
		"Sirs, take away the duke, and guard him sure.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Ah! thus King Henry throws away his crutch\n"+
		"Before his legs be firm to bear his body.\n"+
		"Thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side,\n"+
		"And wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first.\n"+
		"Ah, that my fear were false! ah, that it were!\n"+
		"For, good King Henry, thy decay I fear.\n"+
		"Exit, guarded\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"My lords, what to your wisdoms seemeth best,\n"+
		"Do or undo, as if ourself were here.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"What, will your highness leave the parliament?\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Ay, Margaret; my heart is drown'd with grief,\n"+
		"Whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes,\n"+
		"My body round engirt with misery,\n"+
		"For what's more miserable than discontent?\n"+
		"Ah, uncle Humphrey! in thy face I see\n"+
		"The map of honour, truth and loyalty:\n"+
		"And yet, good Humphrey, is the hour to come\n"+
		"That e'er I proved thee false or fear'd thy faith.\n"+
		"What louring star now envies thy estate,\n"+
		"That these great lords and Margaret our queen\n"+
		"Do seek subversion of thy harmless life?\n"+
		"Thou never didst them wrong, nor no man wrong;\n"+
		"And as the butcher takes away the calf\n"+
		"And binds the wretch, and beats it when it strays,\n"+
		"Bearing it to the bloody slaughter-house,\n"+
		"Even so remorseless have they borne him hence;\n"+
		"And as the dam runs lowing up and down,\n"+
		"Looking the way her harmless young one went,\n"+
		"And can do nought but wail her darling's loss,\n"+
		"Even so myself bewails good Gloucester's case\n"+
		"With sad unhelpful tears, and with dimm'd eyes\n"+
		"Look after him and cannot do him good,\n"+
		"So mighty are his vowed enemies.\n"+
		"His fortunes I will weep; and, 'twixt each groan\n"+
		"Say 'Who's a traitor? Gloucester he is none.'\n"+
		"Exeunt all but QUEEN MARGARET, CARDINAL, SUFFOLK, and YORK; SOMERSET remains apart\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Free lords, cold snow melts with the sun's hot beams.\n"+
		"Henry my lord is cold in great affairs,\n"+
		"Too full of foolish pity, and Gloucester's show\n"+
		"Beguiles him as the mournful crocodile\n"+
		"With sorrow snares relenting passengers,\n"+
		"Or as the snake roll'd in a flowering bank,\n"+
		"With shining chequer'd slough, doth sting a child\n"+
		"That for the beauty thinks it excellent.\n"+
		"Believe me, lords, were none more wise than I--\n"+
		"And yet herein I judge mine own wit good--\n"+
		"This Gloucester should be quickly rid the world,\n"+
		"To rid us of the fear we have of him.\n"+
		"CARDINAL\n"+
		"That he should die is worthy policy;\n"+
		"But yet we want a colour for his death:\n"+
		"'Tis meet he be condemn'd by course of law.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"But, in my mind, that were no policy:\n"+
		"The king will labour still to save his life,\n"+
		"The commons haply rise, to save his life;\n"+
		"And yet we have but trivial argument,\n"+
		"More than mistrust, that shows him worthy death.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"So that, by this, you would not have him die.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Ah, York, no man alive so fain as I!\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"'Tis York that hath more reason for his death.\n"+
		"But, my lord cardinal, and you, my Lord of Suffolk,\n"+
		"Say as you think, and speak it from your souls,\n"+
		"Were't not all one, an empty eagle were set\n"+
		"To guard the chicken from a hungry kite,\n"+
		"As place Duke Humphrey for the king's protector?\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"So the poor chicken should be sure of death.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Madam, 'tis true; and were't not madness, then,\n"+
		"To make the fox surveyor of the fold?\n"+
		"Who being accused a crafty murderer,\n"+
		"His guilt should be but idly posted over,\n"+
		"Because his purpose is not executed.\n"+
		"No; let him die, in that he is a fox,\n"+
		"By nature proved an enemy to the flock,\n"+
		"Before his chaps be stain'd with crimson blood,\n"+
		"As Humphrey, proved by reasons, to my liege.\n"+
		"And do not stand on quillets how to slay him:\n"+
		"Be it by gins, by snares, by subtlety,\n"+
		"Sleeping or waking, 'tis no matter how,\n"+
		"So he be dead; for that is good deceit\n"+
		"Which mates him first that first intends deceit.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Thrice-noble Suffolk, 'tis resolutely spoke.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Not resolute, except so much were done;\n"+
		"For things are often spoke and seldom meant:\n"+
		"But that my heart accordeth with my tongue,\n"+
		"Seeing the deed is meritorious,\n"+
		"And to preserve my sovereign from his foe,\n"+
		"Say but the word, and I will be his priest.\n"+
		"CARDINAL\n"+
		"But I would have him dead, my Lord of Suffolk,\n"+
		"Ere you can take due orders for a priest:\n"+
		"Say you consent and censure well the deed,\n"+
		"And I'll provide his executioner,\n"+
		"I tender so the safety of my liege.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Here is my hand, the deed is worthy doing.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"And so say I.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"And I and now we three have spoke it,\n"+
		"It skills not greatly who impugns our doom.\n"+
		"Enter a Post\n"+
		"Post\n"+
		"Great lords, from Ireland am I come amain,\n"+
		"To signify that rebels there are up\n"+
		"And put the Englishmen unto the sword:\n"+
		"Send succors, lords, and stop the rage betime,\n"+
		"Before the wound do grow uncurable;\n"+
		"For, being green, there is great hope of help.\n"+
		"CARDINAL\n"+
		"A breach that craves a quick expedient stop!\n"+
		"What counsel give you in this weighty cause?\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"That Somerset be sent as regent thither:\n"+
		"'Tis meet that lucky ruler be employ'd;\n"+
		"Witness the fortune he hath had in France.\n"+
		"SOMERSET\n"+
		"If York, with all his far-fet policy,\n"+
		"Had been the regent there instead of me,\n"+
		"He never would have stay'd in France so long.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"No, not to lose it all, as thou hast done:\n"+
		"I rather would have lost my life betimes\n"+
		"Than bring a burthen of dishonour home\n"+
		"By staying there so long till all were lost.\n"+
		"Show me one scar character'd on thy skin:\n"+
		"Men's flesh preserved so whole do seldom win.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Nay, then, this spark will prove a raging fire,\n"+
		"If wind and fuel be brought to feed it with:\n"+
		"No more, good York; sweet Somerset, be still:\n"+
		"Thy fortune, York, hadst thou been regent there,\n"+
		"Might happily have proved far worse than his.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"What, worse than nought? nay, then, a shame take all!\n"+
		"SOMERSET\n"+
		"And, in the number, thee that wishest shame!\n"+
		"CARDINAL\n"+
		"My Lord of York, try what your fortune is.\n"+
		"The uncivil kerns of Ireland are in arms\n"+
		"And temper clay with blood of Englishmen:\n"+
		"To Ireland will you lead a band of men,\n"+
		"Collected choicely, from each county some,\n"+
		"And try your hap against the Irishmen?\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"I will, my lord, so please his majesty.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Why, our authority is his consent,\n"+
		"And what we do establish he confirms:\n"+
		"Then, noble York, take thou this task in hand.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"I am content: provide me soldiers, lords,\n"+
		"Whiles I take order for mine own affairs.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"A charge, Lord York, that I will see perform'd.\n"+
		"But now return we to the false Duke Humphrey.\n"+
		"CARDINAL\n"+
		"No more of him; for I will deal with him\n"+
		"That henceforth he shall trouble us no more.\n"+
		"And so break off; the day is almost spent:\n"+
		"Lord Suffolk, you and I must talk of that event.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"My Lord of Suffolk, within fourteen days\n"+
		"At Bristol I expect my soldiers;\n"+
		"For there I'll ship them all for Ireland.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"I'll see it truly done, my Lord of York.\n"+
		"Exeunt all but YORK\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"Now, York, or never, steel thy fearful thoughts,\n"+
		"And change misdoubt to resolution:\n"+
		"Be that thou hopest to be, or what thou art\n"+
		"Resign to death; it is not worth the enjoying:\n"+
		"Let pale-faced fear keep with the mean-born man,\n"+
		"And find no harbour in a royal heart.\n"+
		"Faster than spring-time showers comes thought\n"+
		"on thought,\n"+
		"And not a thought but thinks on dignity.\n"+
		"My brain more busy than the labouring spider\n"+
		"Weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies.\n"+
		"Well, nobles, well, 'tis politicly done,\n"+
		"To send me packing with an host of men:\n"+
		"I fear me you but warm the starved snake,\n"+
		"Who, cherish'd in your breasts, will sting\n"+
		"your hearts.\n"+
		"'Twas men I lack'd and you will give them me:\n"+
		"I take it kindly; and yet be well assured\n"+
		"You put sharp weapons in a madman's hands.\n"+
		"Whiles I in Ireland nourish a mighty band,\n"+
		"I will stir up in England some black storm\n"+
		"Shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell;\n"+
		"And this fell tempest shall not cease to rage\n"+
		"Until the golden circuit on my head,\n"+
		"Like to the glorious sun's transparent beams,\n"+
		"Do calm the fury of this mad-bred flaw.\n"+
		"And, for a minister of my intent,\n"+
		"I have seduced a headstrong Kentishman,\n"+
		"John Cade of Ashford,\n"+
		"To make commotion, as full well he can,\n"+
		"Under the title of John Mortimer.\n"+
		"In Ireland have I seen this stubborn Cade\n"+
		"Oppose himself against a troop of kerns,\n"+
		"And fought so long, till that his thighs with darts\n"+
		"Were almost like a sharp-quill'd porpentine;\n"+
		"And, in the end being rescued, I have seen\n"+
		"Him caper upright like a wild Morisco,\n"+
		"Shaking the bloody darts as he his bells.\n"+
		"Full often, like a shag-hair'd crafty kern,\n"+
		"Hath he conversed with the enemy,\n"+
		"And undiscover'd come to me again\n"+
		"And given me notice of their villanies.\n"+
		"This devil here shall be my substitute;\n"+
		"For that John Mortimer, which now is dead,\n"+
		"In face, in gait, in speech, he doth resemble:\n"+
		"By this I shall perceive the commons' mind,\n"+
		"How they affect the house and claim of York.\n"+
		"Say he be taken, rack'd and tortured,\n"+
		"I know no pain they can inflict upon him\n"+
		"Will make him say I moved him to those arms.\n"+
		"Say that he thrive, as 'tis great like he will,\n"+
		"Why, then from Ireland come I with my strength\n"+
		"And reap the harvest which that rascal sow'd;\n"+
		"For Humphrey being dead, as he shall be,\n"+
		"And Henry put apart, the next for me.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE II. Bury St. Edmund's. A room of state.\n"+
		"Enter certain Murderers, hastily\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"Run to my Lord of Suffolk; let him know\n"+
		"We have dispatch'd the duke, as he commanded.\n"+
		"Second Murderer\n"+
		"O that it were to do! What have we done?\n"+
		"Didst ever hear a man so penitent?\n"+
		"Enter SUFFOLK\n"+
		"First Murder\n"+
		"Here comes my lord.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Now, sirs, have you dispatch'd this thing?\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"Ay, my good lord, he's dead.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Why, that's well said. Go, get you to my house;\n"+
		"I will reward you for this venturous deed.\n"+
		"The king and all the peers are here at hand.\n"+
		"Have you laid fair the bed? Is all things well,\n"+
		"According as I gave directions?\n"+
		"First Murderer\n"+
		"'Tis, my good lord.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Away! be gone.\n"+
		"Exeunt Murderers\n"+
		"Sound trumpets. Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN MARGARET, CARDINAL, SOMERSET, with Attendants\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Go, call our uncle to our presence straight;\n"+
		"Say we intend to try his grace to-day.\n"+
		"If he be guilty, as 'tis published.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"I'll call him presently, my noble lord.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Lords, take your places; and, I pray you all,\n"+
		"Proceed no straiter 'gainst our uncle Gloucester\n"+
		"Than from true evidence of good esteem\n"+
		"He be approved in practise culpable.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"God forbid any malice should prevail,\n"+
		"That faultless may condemn a nobleman!\n"+
		"Pray God he may acquit him of suspicion!\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"I thank thee, Meg; these words content me much.\n"+
		"Re-enter SUFFOLK\n"+
		"How now! why look'st thou pale? why tremblest thou?\n"+
		"Where is our uncle? what's the matter, Suffolk?\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Dead in his bed, my lord; Gloucester is dead.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Marry, God forfend!\n"+
		"CARDINAL\n"+
		"God's secret judgment: I did dream to-night\n"+
		"The duke was dumb and could not speak a word.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI swoons\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"How fares my lord? Help, lords! the king is dead.\n"+
		"SOMERSET\n"+
		"Rear up his body; wring him by the nose.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Run, go, help, help! O Henry, ope thine eyes!\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"He doth revive again: madam, be patient.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"O heavenly God!\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"How fares my gracious lord?\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Comfort, my sovereign! gracious Henry, comfort!\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"What, doth my Lord of Suffolk comfort me?\n"+
		"Came he right now to sing a raven's note,\n"+
		"Whose dismal tune bereft my vital powers;\n"+
		"And thinks he that the chirping of a wren,\n"+
		"By crying comfort from a hollow breast,\n"+
		"Can chase away the first-conceived sound?\n"+
		"Hide not thy poison with such sugar'd words;\n"+
		"Lay not thy hands on me; forbear, I say;\n"+
		"Their touch affrights me as a serpent's sting.\n"+
		"Thou baleful messenger, out of my sight!\n"+
		"Upon thy eye-balls murderous tyranny\n"+
		"Sits in grim majesty, to fright the world.\n"+
		"Look not upon me, for thine eyes are wounding:\n"+
		"Yet do not go away: come, basilisk,\n"+
		"And kill the innocent gazer with thy sight;\n"+
		"For in the shade of death I shall find joy;\n"+
		"In life but double death, now Gloucester's dead.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Why do you rate my Lord of Suffolk thus?\n"+
		"Although the duke was enemy to him,\n"+
		"Yet he most Christian-like laments his death:\n"+
		"And for myself, foe as he was to me,\n"+
		"Might liquid tears or heart-offending groans\n"+
		"Or blood-consuming sighs recall his life,\n"+
		"I would be blind with weeping, sick with groans,\n"+
		"Look pale as primrose with blood-drinking sighs,\n"+
		"And all to have the noble duke alive.\n"+
		"What know I how the world may deem of me?\n"+
		"For it is known we were but hollow friends:\n"+
		"It may be judged I made the duke away;\n"+
		"So shall my name with slander's tongue be wounded,\n"+
		"And princes' courts be fill'd with my reproach.\n"+
		"This get I by his death: ay me, unhappy!\n"+
		"To be a queen, and crown'd with infamy!\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Ah, woe is me for Gloucester, wretched man!\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Be woe for me, more wretched than he is.\n"+
		"What, dost thou turn away and hide thy face?\n"+
		"I am no loathsome leper; look on me.\n"+
		"What! art thou, like the adder, waxen deaf?\n"+
		"Be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn queen.\n"+
		"Is all thy comfort shut in Gloucester's tomb?\n"+
		"Why, then, dame Margaret was ne'er thy joy.\n"+
		"Erect his statue and worship it,\n"+
		"And make my image but an alehouse sign.\n"+
		"Was I for this nigh wreck'd upon the sea\n"+
		"And twice by awkward wind from England's bank\n"+
		"Drove back again unto my native clime?\n"+
		"What boded this, but well forewarning wind\n"+
		"Did seem to say 'Seek not a scorpion's nest,\n"+
		"Nor set no footing on this unkind shore'?\n"+
		"What did I then, but cursed the gentle gusts\n"+
		"And he that loosed them forth their brazen caves:\n"+
		"And bid them blow towards England's blessed shore,\n"+
		"Or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock\n"+
		"Yet AEolus would not be a murderer,\n"+
		"But left that hateful office unto thee:\n"+
		"The pretty-vaulting sea refused to drown me,\n"+
		"Knowing that thou wouldst have me drown'd on shore,\n"+
		"With tears as salt as sea, through thy unkindness:\n"+
		"The splitting rocks cower'd in the sinking sands\n"+
		"And would not dash me with their ragged sides,\n"+
		"Because thy flinty heart, more hard than they,\n"+
		"Might in thy palace perish Margaret.\n"+
		"As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs,\n"+
		"When from thy shore the tempest beat us back,\n"+
		"I stood upon the hatches in the storm,\n"+
		"And when the dusky sky began to rob\n"+
		"My earnest-gaping sight of thy land's view,\n"+
		"I took a costly jewel from my neck,\n"+
		"A heart it was, bound in with diamonds,\n"+
		"And threw it towards thy land: the sea received it,\n"+
		"And so I wish'd thy body might my heart:\n"+
		"And even with this I lost fair England's view\n"+
		"And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart\n"+
		"And call'd them blind and dusky spectacles,\n"+
		"For losing ken of Albion's wished coast.\n"+
		"How often have I tempted Suffolk's tongue,\n"+
		"The agent of thy foul inconstancy,\n"+
		"To sit and witch me, as Ascanius did\n"+
		"When he to madding Dido would unfold\n"+
		"His father's acts commenced in burning Troy!\n"+
		"Am I not witch'd like her? or thou not false like him?\n"+
		"Ay me, I can no more! die, Margaret!\n"+
		"For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long.\n"+
		"Noise within. Enter WARWICK, SALISBURY, and many Commons\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"It is reported, mighty sovereign,\n"+
		"That good Duke Humphrey traitorously is murder'd\n"+
		"By Suffolk and the Cardinal Beaufort's means.\n"+
		"The commons, like an angry hive of bees\n"+
		"That want their leader, scatter up and down\n"+
		"And care not who they sting in his revenge.\n"+
		"Myself have calm'd their spleenful mutiny,\n"+
		"Until they hear the order of his death.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"That he is dead, good Warwick, 'tis too true;\n"+
		"But how he died God knows, not Henry:\n"+
		"Enter his chamber, view his breathless corpse,\n"+
		"And comment then upon his sudden death.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"That shall I do, my liege. Stay, Salisbury,\n"+
		"With the rude multitude till I return.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"O Thou that judgest all things, stay my thoughts,\n"+
		"My thoughts, that labour to persuade my soul\n"+
		"Some violent hands were laid on Humphrey's life!\n"+
		"If my suspect be false, forgive me, God,\n"+
		"For judgment only doth belong to thee.\n"+
		"Fain would I go to chafe his paly lips\n"+
		"With twenty thousand kisses, and to drain\n"+
		"Upon his face an ocean of salt tears,\n"+
		"To tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk,\n"+
		"And with my fingers feel his hand unfeeling:\n"+
		"But all in vain are these mean obsequies;\n"+
		"And to survey his dead and earthly image,\n"+
		"What were it but to make my sorrow greater?\n"+
		"Re-enter WARWICK and others, bearing GLOUCESTER'S body on a bed\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Come hither, gracious sovereign, view this body.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"That is to see how deep my grave is made;\n"+
		"For with his soul fled all my worldly solace,\n"+
		"For seeing him I see my life in death.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"As surely as my soul intends to live\n"+
		"With that dread King that took our state upon him\n"+
		"To free us from his father's wrathful curse,\n"+
		"I do believe that violent hands were laid\n"+
		"Upon the life of this thrice-famed duke.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"A dreadful oath, sworn with a solemn tongue!\n"+
		"What instance gives Lord Warwick for his vow?\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"See how the blood is settled in his face.\n"+
		"Oft have I seen a timely-parted ghost,\n"+
		"Of ashy semblance, meagre, pale and bloodless,\n"+
		"Being all descended to the labouring heart;\n"+
		"Who, in the conflict that it holds with death,\n"+
		"Attracts the same for aidance 'gainst the enemy;\n"+
		"Which with the heart there cools and ne'er returneth\n"+
		"To blush and beautify the cheek again.\n"+
		"But see, his face is black and full of blood,\n"+
		"His eye-balls further out than when he lived,\n"+
		"Staring full ghastly like a strangled man;\n"+
		"His hair uprear'd, his nostrils stretched with struggling;\n"+
		"His hands abroad display'd, as one that grasp'd\n"+
		"And tugg'd for life and was by strength subdued:\n"+
		"Look, on the sheets his hair you see, is sticking;\n"+
		"His well-proportion'd beard made rough and rugged,\n"+
		"Like to the summer's corn by tempest lodged.\n"+
		"It cannot be but he was murder'd here;\n"+
		"The least of all these signs were probable.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Why, Warwick, who should do the duke to death?\n"+
		"Myself and Beaufort had him in protection;\n"+
		"And we, I hope, sir, are no murderers.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"But both of you were vow'd Duke Humphrey's foes,\n"+
		"And you, forsooth, had the good duke to keep:\n"+
		"'Tis like you would not feast him like a friend;\n"+
		"And 'tis well seen he found an enemy.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Then you, belike, suspect these noblemen\n"+
		"As guilty of Duke Humphrey's timeless death.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh\n"+
		"And sees fast by a butcher with an axe,\n"+
		"But will suspect 'twas he that made the slaughter?\n"+
		"Who finds the partridge in the puttock's nest,\n"+
		"But may imagine how the bird was dead,\n"+
		"Although the kite soar with unbloodied beak?\n"+
		"Even so suspicious is this tragedy.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Are you the butcher, Suffolk? Where's your knife?\n"+
		"Is Beaufort term'd a kite? Where are his talons?\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"I wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men;\n"+
		"But here's a vengeful sword, rusted with ease,\n"+
		"That shall be scoured in his rancorous heart\n"+
		"That slanders me with murder's crimson badge.\n"+
		"Say, if thou darest, proud Lord of Warwick-shire,\n"+
		"That I am faulty in Duke Humphrey's death.\n"+
		"Exeunt CARDINAL, SOMERSET, and others\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"What dares not Warwick, if false Suffolk dare him?\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"He dares not calm his contumelious spirit\n"+
		"Nor cease to be an arrogant controller,\n"+
		"Though Suffolk dare him twenty thousand times.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Madam, be still; with reverence may I say;\n"+
		"For every word you speak in his behalf\n"+
		"Is slander to your royal dignity.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Blunt-witted lord, ignoble in demeanor!\n"+
		"If ever lady wrong'd her lord so much,\n"+
		"Thy mother took into her blameful bed\n"+
		"Some stern untutor'd churl, and noble stock\n"+
		"Was graft with crab-tree slip; whose fruit thou art,\n"+
		"And never of the Nevils' noble race.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"But that the guilt of murder bucklers thee\n"+
		"And I should rob the deathsman of his fee,\n"+
		"Quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames,\n"+
		"And that my sovereign's presence makes me mild,\n"+
		"I would, false murderous coward, on thy knee\n"+
		"Make thee beg pardon for thy passed speech,\n"+
		"And say it was thy mother that thou meant'st\n"+
		"That thou thyself was born in bastardy;\n"+
		"And after all this fearful homage done,\n"+
		"Give thee thy hire and send thy soul to hell,\n"+
		"Pernicious blood-sucker of sleeping men!\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Thou shall be waking well I shed thy blood,\n"+
		"If from this presence thou darest go with me.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Away even now, or I will drag thee hence:\n"+
		"Unworthy though thou art, I'll cope with thee\n"+
		"And do some service to Duke Humphrey's ghost.\n"+
		"Exeunt SUFFOLK and WARWICK\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"What stronger breastplate than a heart untainted!\n"+
		"Thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just,\n"+
		"And he but naked, though lock'd up in steel\n"+

		"What noise is this?\n"+
		"Re-enter SUFFOLK and WARWICK, with their weapons drawn\n"+

		"Lest, being suffer'd in that harmful slumber,\n"+
		"The mortal worm might make the sleep eternal;\n"+
		"And therefore do they cry, though you forbid,\n"+
		"That they will guard you, whether you will or no,\n"+
		"From such fell serpents as false Suffolk is,\n"+

		"But you, my lord, were glad to be employ'd,\n"+
		"To show how quaint an orator you are:\n"+

		"I thank them for their tender loving care;\n"+

		"Yet did I purpose as they do entreat;\n"+
		"For, sure, my thoughts do hourly prophesy\n"+

		"And therefore, by His majesty I swear,\n"+

		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"O Henry, let me plead for gentle Suffolk!\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Ungentle queen, to call him gentle Suffolk!\n"+
		"No more, I say: if thou dost plead for him,\n"+
		"Thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath.\n"+
		"Had I but said, I would have kept my word,\n"+
		"But when I swear, it is irrevocable.\n"+
		"If, after three days' space, thou here be'st found\n"+

		"I have great matters to impart to thee.\n"+
		"Exeunt all but QUEEN MARGARET and SUFFOLK\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Mischance and sorrow go along with you!\n"+
		"Heart's discontent and sour affliction\n"+
		"Be playfellows to keep you company!\n"+
		"There's two of you; the devil make a third!\n"+
		"And threefold vengeance tend upon your steps!\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Cease, gentle queen, these execrations,\n"+
		"And let thy Suffolk take his heavy leave.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Fie, coward woman and soft-hearted wretch!\n"+
		"Hast thou not spirit to curse thine enemy?\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"A plague upon them! wherefore should I curse them?\n"+
		"Would curses kill, as doth the mandrake's groan,\n"+
		"I would invent as bitter-searching terms,\n"+
		"As curst, as harsh and horrible to hear,\n"+
		"Deliver'd strongly through my fixed teeth,\n"+
		"With full as many signs of deadly hate,\n"+
		"As lean-faced Envy in her loathsome cave:\n"+
		"My tongue should stumble in mine earnest words;\n"+
		"Mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint;\n"+
		"Mine hair be fixed on end, as one distract;\n"+
		"Ay, every joint should seem to curse and ban:\n"+
		"And even now my burthen'd heart would break,\n"+
		"Should I not curse them. Poison be their drink!\n"+
		"Gall, worse than gall, the daintiest that they taste!\n"+
		"Their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees!\n"+
		"Their chiefest prospect murdering basilisks!\n"+
		"Their softest touch as smart as lizards' sting!\n"+
		"Their music frightful as the serpent's hiss,\n"+
		"And boding screech-owls make the concert full!\n"+
		"All the foul terrors in dark-seated hell--\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Enough, sweet Suffolk; thou torment'st thyself;\n"+
		"And these dread curses, like the sun 'gainst glass,\n"+
		"Or like an overcharged gun, recoil,\n"+
		"And turn the force of them upon thyself.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"You bade me ban, and will you bid me leave?\n"+
		"Now, by the ground that I am banish'd from,\n"+
		"Well could I curse away a winter's night,\n"+
		"Though standing naked on a mountain top,\n"+
		"Where biting cold would never let grass grow,\n"+
		"And think it but a minute spent in sport.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"O, let me entreat thee cease. Give me thy hand,\n"+
		"That I may dew it with my mournful tears;\n"+
		"Nor let the rain of heaven wet this place,\n"+
		"To wash away my woful monuments.\n"+
		"O, could this kiss be printed in thy hand,\n"+
		"That thou mightst think upon these by the seal,\n"+
		"Through whom a thousand sighs are breathed for thee!\n"+
		"So, get thee gone, that I may know my grief;\n"+
		"'Tis but surmised whiles thou art standing by,\n"+
		"As one that surfeits thinking on a want.\n"+
		"I will repeal thee, or, be well assured,\n"+
		"Adventure to be banished myself:\n"+
		"And banished I am, if but from thee.\n"+
		"Go; speak not to me; even now be gone.\n"+
		"O, go not yet! Even thus two friends condemn'd\n"+
		"Embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves,\n"+
		"Loather a hundred times to part than die.\n"+
		"Yet now farewell; and farewell life with thee!\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Thus is poor Suffolk ten times banished;\n"+
		"Once by the king, and three times thrice by thee.\n"+
		"'Tis not the land I care for, wert thou thence;\n"+
		"A wilderness is populous enough,\n"+
		"So Suffolk had thy heavenly company:\n"+
		"For where thou art, there is the world itself,\n"+
		"With every several pleasure in the world,\n"+
		"And where thou art not, desolation.\n"+
		"I can no more: live thou to joy thy life;\n"+
		"Myself no joy in nought but that thou livest.\n"+
		"Enter VAUX\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Wither goes Vaux so fast? what news, I prithee?\n"+
		"VAUX\n"+
		"To signify unto his majesty\n"+
		"That Cardinal Beaufort is at point of death;\n"+
		"For suddenly a grievous sickness took him,\n"+
		"That makes him gasp and stare and catch the air,\n"+
		"Blaspheming God and cursing men on earth.\n"+
		"Sometimes he talks as if Duke Humphrey's ghost\n"+
		"Were by his side; sometime he calls the king,\n"+
		"And whispers to his pillow, as to him,\n"+
		"The secrets of his overcharged soul;\n"+
		"And I am sent to tell his majesty\n"+
		"That even now he cries aloud for him.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Go tell this heavy message to the king.\n"+
		"Exit VAUX\n"+
		"Ay me! what is this world! what news are these!\n"+
		"But wherefore grieve I at an hour's poor loss,\n"+
		"Omitting Suffolk's exile, my soul's treasure?\n"+
		"Why only, Suffolk, mourn I not for thee,\n"+
		"And with the southern clouds contend in tears,\n"+
		"Theirs for the earth's increase, mine for my sorrows?\n"+
		"Now get thee hence: the king, thou know'st, is coming;\n"+
		"If thou be found by me, thou art but dead.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"If I depart from thee, I cannot live;\n"+
		"And in thy sight to die, what were it else\n"+
		"But like a pleasant slumber in thy lap?\n"+
		"Here could I breathe my soul into the air,\n"+
		"As mild and gentle as the cradle-babe\n"+
		"Dying with mother's dug between its lips:\n"+
		"Where, from thy sight, I should be raging mad,\n"+
		"And cry out for thee to close up mine eyes,\n"+
		"To have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth;\n"+
		"So shouldst thou either turn my flying soul,\n"+
		"Or I should breathe it so into thy body,\n"+
		"And then it lived in sweet Elysium.\n"+
		"To die by thee were but to die in jest;\n"+
		"From thee to die were torture more than death:\n"+
		"O, let me stay, befall what may befall!\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Away! though parting be a fretful corrosive,\n"+
		"It is applied to a deathful wound.\n"+
		"To France, sweet Suffolk: let me hear from thee;\n"+
		"For wheresoe'er thou art in this world's globe,\n"+
		"I'll have an Iris that shall find thee out.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"I go.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"And take my heart with thee.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"A jewel, lock'd into the wofull'st cask\n"+
		"That ever did contain a thing of worth.\n"+
		"Even as a splitted bark, so sunder we\n"+
		"This way fall I to death.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"This way for me.\n"+
		"Exeunt severally\n"+
		"SCENE III. A bedchamber.\n"+
		"Enter the KING, SALISBURY, WARWICK, to the CARDINAL in bed\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"How fares my lord? speak, Beaufort, to\n"+
		"thy sovereign.\n"+
		"CARDINAL\n"+
		"If thou be'st death, I'll give thee England's treasure,\n"+
		"Enough to purchase such another island,\n"+
		"So thou wilt let me live, and feel no pain.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Ah, what a sign it is of evil life,\n"+
		"Where death's approach is seen so terrible!\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Beaufort, it is thy sovereign speaks to thee.\n"+
		"CARDINAL\n"+
		"Bring me unto my trial when you will.\n"+
		"Died he not in his bed? where should he die?\n"+
		"Can I make men live, whether they will or no?\n"+
		"O, torture me no more! I will confess.\n"+
		"Alive again? then show me where he is:\n"+
		"I'll give a thousand pound to look upon him.\n"+
		"He hath no eyes, the dust hath blinded them.\n"+
		"Comb down his hair; look, look! it stands upright,\n"+
		"Like lime-twigs set to catch my winged soul.\n"+
		"Give me some drink; and bid the apothecary\n"+
		"Bring the strong poison that I bought of him.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"O thou eternal Mover of the heavens.\n"+
		"Look with a gentle eye upon this wretch!\n"+
		"O, beat away the busy meddling fiend\n"+
		"That lays strong siege unto this wretch's soul.\n"+
		"And from his bosom purge this black despair!\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"See, how the pangs of death do make him grin!\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"Disturb him not; let him pass peaceably.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Peace to his soul, if God's good pleasure be!\n"+
		"Lord cardinal, if thou think'st on heaven's bliss,\n"+
		"Hold up thy hand, make signal of thy hope.\n"+
		"He dies, and makes no sign. O God, forgive him!\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"So bad a death argues a monstrous life.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Forbear to judge, for we are sinners all.\n"+
		"Close up his eyes and draw the curtain close;\n"+
		"And let us all to meditation.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT IV\n"+
		"SCENE I. The coast of Kent.\n"+
		"Alarum. Fight at sea. Ordnance goes off. Enter a Captain, a Master, a Master's-mate, WALTER WHITMORE, and others; with them SUFFOLK, and others, prisoners\n"+
		"Captain\n"+
		"The gaudy, blabbing and remorseful day\n"+
		"Is crept into the bosom of the sea;\n"+
		"And now loud-howling wolves arouse the jades\n"+
		"That drag the tragic melancholy night;\n"+
		"Who, with their drowsy, slow and flagging wings,\n"+
		"Clip dead men's graves and from their misty jaws\n"+
		"Breathe foul contagious darkness in the air.\n"+
		"Therefore bring forth the soldiers of our prize;\n"+
		"For, whilst our pinnace anchors in the Downs,\n"+
		"Here shall they make their ransom on the sand,\n"+
		"Or with their blood stain this discolour'd shore.\n"+
		"Master, this prisoner freely give I thee;\n"+
		"And thou that art his mate, make boot of this;\n"+
		"The other, Walter Whitmore, is thy share.\n"+
		"First Gentleman\n"+
		"What is my ransom, master? let me know.\n"+
		"Master\n"+
		"A thousand crowns, or else lay down your head.\n"+
		"Master's-Mate And so much shall you give, or off goes yours.\n"+
		"Captain\n"+
		"What, think you much to pay two thousand crowns,\n"+
		"And bear the name and port of gentlemen?\n"+
		"Cut both the villains' throats; for die you shall:\n"+
		"The lives of those which we have lost in fight\n"+
		"Be counterpoised with such a petty sum!\n"+
		"First Gentleman\n"+
		"I'll give it, sir; and therefore spare my life.\n"+
		"Second Gentleman\n"+
		"And so will I and write home for it straight.\n"+
		"WHITMORE\n"+
		"I lost mine eye in laying the prize aboard,\n"+
		"And therefore to revenge it, shalt thou die;\n"+
		"To SUFFOLK\n"+
		"And so should these, if I might have my will.\n"+
		"Captain\n"+
		"Be not so rash; take ransom, let him live.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Look on my George; I am a gentleman:\n"+
		"Rate me at what thou wilt, thou shalt be paid.\n"+
		"WHITMORE\n"+
		"And so am I; my name is Walter Whitmore.\n"+
		"How now! why start'st thou? what, doth\n"+
		"death affright?\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Thy name affrights me, in whose sound is death.\n"+
		"A cunning man did calculate my birth\n"+
		"And told me that by water I should die:\n"+
		"Yet let not this make thee be bloody-minded;\n"+
		"Thy name is Gaultier, being rightly sounded.\n"+
		"WHITMORE\n"+
		"Gaultier or Walter, which it is, I care not:\n"+
		"Never yet did base dishonour blur our name,\n"+
		"But with our sword we wiped away the blot;\n"+
		"Therefore, when merchant-like I sell revenge,\n"+
		"Broke be my sword, my arms torn and defaced,\n"+
		"And I proclaim'd a coward through the world!\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Stay, Whitmore; for thy prisoner is a prince,\n"+
		"The Duke of Suffolk, William de la Pole.\n"+
		"WHITMORE\n"+
		"The Duke of Suffolk muffled up in rags!\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Ay, but these rags are no part of the duke:\n"+
		"Jove sometimes went disguised, and why not I?\n"+
		"Captain\n"+
		"But Jove was never slain, as thou shalt be.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Obscure and lowly swain, King Henry's blood,\n"+
		"The honourable blood of Lancaster,\n"+
		"Must not be shed by such a jaded groom.\n"+
		"Hast thou not kiss'd thy hand and held my stirrup?\n"+
		"Bare-headed plodded by my foot-cloth mule\n"+
		"And thought thee happy when I shook my head?\n"+
		"How often hast thou waited at my cup,\n"+
		"Fed from my trencher, kneel'd down at the board.\n"+
		"When I have feasted with Queen Margaret?\n"+
		"Remember it and let it make thee crest-fall'n,\n"+
		"Ay, and allay this thy abortive pride;\n"+
		"How in our voiding lobby hast thou stood\n"+
		"And duly waited for my coming forth?\n"+
		"This hand of mine hath writ in thy behalf,\n"+
		"And therefore shall it charm thy riotous tongue.\n"+
		"WHITMORE\n"+
		"Speak, captain, shall I stab the forlorn swain?\n"+
		"Captain\n"+
		"First let my words stab him, as he hath me.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Base slave, thy words are blunt and so art thou.\n"+
		"Captain\n"+
		"Convey him hence and on our longboat's side\n"+
		"Strike off his head.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Thou darest not, for thy own.\n"+
		"Captain\n"+
		"Yes, Pole.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Pole!\n"+
		"Captain\n"+
		"Pool! Sir Pool! lord!\n"+
		"Ay, kennel, puddle, sink; whose filth and dirt\n"+
		"Troubles the silver spring where England drinks.\n"+
		"Now will I dam up this thy yawning mouth\n"+
		"For swallowing the treasure of the realm:\n"+
		"Thy lips that kiss'd the queen shall sweep the ground;\n"+
		"And thou that smiledst at good Duke Humphrey's death,\n"+
		"Against the senseless winds shalt grin in vain,\n"+
		"Who in contempt shall hiss at thee again:\n"+
		"And wedded be thou to the hags of hell,\n"+
		"For daring to affy a mighty lord\n"+
		"Unto the daughter of a worthless king,\n"+
		"Having neither subject, wealth, nor diadem.\n"+
		"By devilish policy art thou grown great,\n"+
		"And, like ambitious Sylla, overgorged\n"+
		"With gobbets of thy mother's bleeding heart.\n"+
		"By thee Anjou and Maine were sold to France,\n"+
		"The false revolting Normans thorough thee\n"+
		"Disdain to call us lord, and Picardy\n"+
		"Hath slain their governors, surprised our forts,\n"+
		"And sent the ragged soldiers wounded home.\n"+
		"The princely Warwick, and the Nevils all,\n"+
		"Whose dreadful swords were never drawn in vain,\n"+
		"As hating thee, are rising up in arms:\n"+
		"And now the house of York, thrust from the crown\n"+
		"By shameful murder of a guiltless king\n"+
		"And lofty proud encroaching tyranny,\n"+
		"Burns with revenging fire; whose hopeful colours\n"+
		"Advance our half-faced sun, striving to shine,\n"+
		"Under the which is writ 'Invitis nubibus.'\n"+
		"The commons here in Kent are up in arms:\n"+
		"And, to conclude, reproach and beggary\n"+
		"Is crept into the palace of our king.\n"+
		"And all by thee. Away! convey him hence.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"O that I were a god, to shoot forth thunder\n"+
		"Upon these paltry, servile, abject drudges!\n"+
		"Small things make base men proud: this villain here,\n"+
		"Being captain of a pinnace, threatens more\n"+
		"Than Bargulus the strong Illyrian pirate.\n"+
		"Drones suck not eagles' blood but rob beehives:\n"+
		"It is impossible that I should die\n"+
		"By such a lowly vassal as thyself.\n"+
		"Thy words move rage and not remorse in me:\n"+
		"I go of message from the queen to France;\n"+
		"I charge thee waft me safely cross the Channel.\n"+
		"Captain\n"+
		"Walter,--\n"+
		"WHITMORE\n"+
		"Come, Suffolk, I must waft thee to thy death.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Gelidus timor occupat artus it is thee I fear.\n"+
		"WHITMORE\n"+
		"Thou shalt have cause to fear before I leave thee.\n"+
		"What, are ye daunted now? now will ye stoop?\n"+
		"First Gentleman\n"+
		"My gracious lord, entreat him, speak him fair.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Suffolk's imperial tongue is stern and rough,\n"+
		"Used to command, untaught to plead for favour.\n"+
		"Far be it we should honour such as these\n"+
		"With humble suit: no, rather let my head\n"+
		"Stoop to the block than these knees bow to any\n"+
		"Save to the God of heaven and to my king;\n"+
		"And sooner dance upon a bloody pole\n"+
		"Than stand uncover'd to the vulgar groom.\n"+
		"True nobility is exempt from fear:\n"+
		"More can I bear than you dare execute.\n"+
		"Captain\n"+
		"Hale him away, and let him talk no more.\n"+
		"SUFFOLK\n"+
		"Come, soldiers, show what cruelty ye can,\n"+
		"That this my death may never be forgot!\n"+
		"Great men oft die by vile bezonians:\n"+
		"A Roman sworder and banditto slave\n"+
		"Murder'd sweet Tully; Brutus' bastard hand\n"+
		"Stabb'd Julius Caesar; savage islanders\n"+
		"Pompey the Great; and Suffolk dies by pirates.\n"+
		"Exeunt Whitmore and others with Suffolk\n"+
		"Captain\n"+
		"And as for these whose ransom we have set,\n"+
		"It is our pleasure one of them depart;\n"+
		"Therefore come you with us and let him go.\n"+
		"Exeunt all but the First Gentleman\n"+
		"Re-enter WHITMORE with SUFFOLK's body\n"+
		"WHITMORE\n"+
		"There let his head and lifeless body lie,\n"+
		"Until the queen his mistress bury it.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"First Gentleman\n"+
		"O barbarous and bloody spectacle!\n"+
		"His body will I bear unto the king:\n"+
		"If he revenge it not, yet will his friends;\n"+
		"So will the queen, that living held him dear.\n"+
		"Exit with the body\n"+
		"SCENE II. Blackheath.\n"+
		"Enter GEORGE BEVIS and JOHN HOLLAND\n"+
		"BEVIS\n"+
		"Come, and get thee a sword, though made of a lath;\n"+
		"they have been up these two days.\n"+
		"HOLLAND\n"+
		"They have the more need to sleep now, then.\n"+
		"BEVIS\n"+
		"I tell thee, Jack Cade the clothier means to dress\n"+
		"the commonwealth, and turn it, and set a new nap upon it.\n"+
		"HOLLAND\n"+
		"So he had need, for 'tis threadbare. Well, I say it\n"+
		"was never merry world in England since gentlemen came up.\n"+
		"BEVIS\n"+
		"O miserable age! virtue is not regarded in handicrafts-men.\n"+
		"HOLLAND\n"+
		"The nobility think scorn to go in leather aprons.\n"+
		"BEVIS\n"+
		"Nay, more, the king's council are no good workmen.\n"+
		"HOLLAND\n"+
		"True; and yet it is said, labour in thy vocation;\n"+
		"which is as much to say as, let the magistrates be\n"+
		"labouring men; and therefore should we be\n"+
		"magistrates.\n"+
		"BEVIS\n"+
		"Thou hast hit it; for there's no better sign of a\n"+
		"brave mind than a hard hand.\n"+
		"HOLLAND\n"+
		"I see them! I see them! there's Best's son, the\n"+
		"tanner of Wingham,--\n"+
		"BEVIS\n"+
		"He shall have the skin of our enemies, to make\n"+
		"dog's-leather of.\n"+
		"HOLLAND\n"+
		"And Dick the Butcher,--\n"+
		"BEVIS\n"+
		"Then is sin struck down like an ox, and iniquity's\n"+
		"throat cut like a calf.\n"+
		"HOLLAND\n"+
		"And Smith the weaver,--\n"+
		"BEVIS\n"+
		"Argo, their thread of life is spun.\n"+
		"HOLLAND\n"+
		"Come, come, let's fall in with them.\n"+
		"Drum. Enter CADE, DICK the Butcher, SMITH the Weaver, and a Sawyer, with infinite numbers\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"We John Cade, so termed of our supposed father,--\n"+
		"DICK\n"+
		"[Aside] Or rather, of stealing a cade of herrings.\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"For our enemies shall fall before us, inspired with\n"+
		"the spirit of putting down kings and princes,\n"+
		"--Command silence.\n"+
		"DICK\n"+
		"Silence!\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"My father was a Mortimer,--\n"+
		"DICK\n"+
		"[Aside] He was an honest man, and a good\n"+
		"bricklayer.\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"My mother a Plantagenet,--\n"+
		"DICK\n"+
		"[Aside] I knew her well; she was a midwife.\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"My wife descended of the Lacies,--\n"+
		"DICK\n"+
		"[Aside] She was, indeed, a pedler's daughter, and\n"+
		"sold many laces.\n"+
		"SMITH\n"+
		"[Aside] But now of late, notable to travel with her\n"+
		"furred pack, she washes bucks here at home.\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"Therefore am I of an honourable house.\n"+
		"DICK\n"+
		"[Aside] Ay, by my faith, the field is honourable;\n"+
		"and there was he borne, under a hedge, for his\n"+
		"father had never a house but the cage.\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"Valiant I am.\n"+
		"SMITH\n"+
		"[Aside] A' must needs; for beggary is valiant.\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"I am able to endure much.\n"+
		"DICK\n"+
		"[Aside] No question of that; for I have seen him\n"+
		"whipped three market-days together.\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"I fear neither sword nor fire.\n"+
		"SMITH\n"+
		"[Aside] He need not fear the sword; for his coat is of proof.\n"+
		"DICK\n"+
		"[Aside] But methinks he should stand in fear of\n"+
		"fire, being burnt i' the hand for stealing of sheep.\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"Be brave, then; for your captain is brave, and vows\n"+
		"reformation. There shall be in England seven\n"+
		"halfpenny loaves sold for a penny: the three-hooped\n"+
		"pot; shall have ten hoops and I will make it felony\n"+
		"to drink small beer: all the realm shall be in\n"+
		"common; and in Cheapside shall my palfrey go to\n"+
		"grass: and when I am king, as king I will be,--\n"+
		"ALL\n"+
		"God save your majesty!\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"I thank you, good people: there shall be no money;\n"+
		"all shall eat and drink on my score; and I will\n"+
		"apparel them all in one livery, that they may agree\n"+
		"like brothers and worship me their lord.\n"+
		"DICK\n"+
		"The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers.\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"Nay, that I mean to do. Is not this a lamentable\n"+
		"thing, that of the skin of an innocent lamb should\n"+
		"be made parchment? that parchment, being scribbled\n"+
		"o'er, should undo a man? Some say the bee stings:\n"+
		"but I say, 'tis the bee's wax; for I did but seal\n"+

		"since. How now! who's there?\n"+
		"Enter some, bringing forward the Clerk of Chatham\n"+
		"SMITH\n"+
		"The clerk of Chatham: he can write and read and\n"+
		"cast accompt.\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"O monstrous!\n"+
		"SMITH\n"+
		"We took him setting of boys' copies.\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"Here's a villain!\n"+
		"SMITH\n"+
		"Has a book in his pocket with red letters in't.\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"Nay, then, he is a conjurer.\n"+
		"DICK\n"+
		"Nay, he can make obligations, and write court-hand.\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"I am sorry for't: the man is a proper man, of mine\n"+
		"honour; unless I find him guilty, he shall not die.\n"+
		"Come hither, sirrah, I must examine thee: what is thy name?\n"+
		"Clerk\n"+
		"Emmanuel.\n"+
		"DICK\n"+
		"They use to write it on the top of letters: 'twill\n"+
		"go hard with you.\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"Let me alone. Dost thou use to write thy name? or\n"+
		"hast thou a mark to thyself, like an honest\n"+
		"plain-dealing man?\n"+
		"CLERK\n"+
		"Sir, I thank God, I have been so well brought up\n"+
		"that I can write my name.\n"+
		"ALL\n"+
		"He hath confessed: away with him! he's a villain\n"+
		"and a traitor.\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"Away with him, I say! hang him with his pen and\n"+
		"ink-horn about his neck.\n"+
		"Exit one with the Clerk\n"+
		"Enter MICHAEL\n"+
		"MICHAEL\n"+
		"Where's our general?\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"Here I am, thou particular fellow.\n"+
		"MICHAEL\n"+
		"Fly, fly, fly! Sir Humphrey Stafford and his\n"+
		"brother are hard by, with the king's forces.\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"Stand, villain, stand, or I'll fell thee down. He\n"+
		"shall be encountered with a man as good as himself:\n"+
		"he is but a knight, is a'?\n"+
		"MICHAEL\n"+
		"No.\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"To equal him, I will make myself a knight presently.\n"+
		"Kneels\n"+
		"Rise up Sir John Mortimer.\n"+
		"Rises\n"+
		"Now have at him!\n"+
		"Enter SIR HUMPHREY and WILLIAM STAFFORD, with drum and soldiers\n"+
		"SIR HUMPHREY\n"+
		"Rebellious hinds, the filth and scum of Kent,\n"+
		"Mark'd for the gallows, lay your weapons down;\n"+
		"Home to your cottages, forsake this groom:\n"+
		"The king is merciful, if you revolt.\n"+
		"WILLIAM STAFFORD\n"+
		"But angry, wrathful, and inclined to blood,\n"+
		"If you go forward; therefore yield, or die.\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"As for these silken-coated slaves, I pass not:\n"+
		"It is to you, good people, that I speak,\n"+
		"Over whom, in time to come, I hope to reign;\n"+
		"For I am rightful heir unto the crown.\n"+
		"SIR HUMPHREY\n"+
		"Villain, thy father was a plasterer;\n"+
		"And thou thyself a shearman, art thou not?\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"And Adam was a gardener.\n"+
		"WILLIAM STAFFORD\n"+
		"And what of that?\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"Marry, this: Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March.\n"+
		"Married the Duke of Clarence' daughter, did he not?\n"+
		"SIR HUMPHREY\n"+
		"Ay, sir.\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"By her he had two children at one birth.\n"+
		"WILLIAM STAFFORD\n"+
		"That's false.\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"Ay, there's the question; but I say, 'tis true:\n"+
		"The elder of them, being put to nurse,\n"+
		"Was by a beggar-woman stolen away;\n"+
		"And, ignorant of his birth and parentage,\n"+
		"Became a bricklayer when he came to age:\n"+
		"His son am I; deny it, if you can.\n"+
		"DICK\n"+
		"Nay, 'tis too true; therefore he shall be king.\n"+
		"SMITH\n"+
		"Sir, he made a chimney in my father's house, and\n"+
		"the bricks are alive at this day to testify it;\n"+
		"therefore deny it not.\n"+
		"SIR HUMPHREY\n"+
		"And will you credit this base drudge's words,\n"+
		"That speaks he knows not what?\n"+
		"ALL\n"+
		"Ay, marry, will we; therefore get ye gone.\n"+
		"WILLIAM STAFFORD\n"+
		"Jack Cade, the Duke of York hath taught you this.\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"[Aside] He lies, for I invented it myself.\n"+
		"Go to, sirrah, tell the king from me, that, for his\n"+
		"father's sake, Henry the Fifth, in whose time boys\n"+
		"went to span-counter for French crowns, I am content\n"+
		"he shall reign; but I'll be protector over him.\n"+
		"DICK\n"+
		"And furthermore, well have the Lord Say's head for\n"+
		"selling the dukedom of Maine.\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"And good reason; for thereby is England mained, and\n"+
		"fain to go with a staff, but that my puissance holds\n"+
		"it up. Fellow kings, I tell you that that Lord Say\n"+
		"hath gelded the commonwealth, and made it an eunuch:\n"+
		"and more than that, he can speak French; and\n"+
		"therefore he is a traitor.\n"+
		"SIR HUMPHREY\n"+
		"O gross and miserable ignorance!\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"Nay, answer, if you can: the Frenchmen are our\n"+
		"enemies; go to, then, I ask but this: can he that\n"+
		"speaks with the tongue of an enemy be a good\n"+
		"counsellor, or no?\n"+
		"ALL\n"+
		"No, no; and therefore we'll have his head.\n"+
		"WILLIAM STAFFORD\n"+
		"Well, seeing gentle words will not prevail,\n"+
		"Assail them with the army of the king.\n"+
		"SIR HUMPHREY\n"+
		"Herald, away; and throughout every town\n"+
		"Proclaim them traitors that are up with Cade;\n"+
		"That those which fly before the battle ends\n"+
		"May, even in their wives' and children's sight,\n"+
		"Be hang'd up for example at their doors:\n"+
		"And you that be the king's friends, follow me.\n"+
		"Exeunt WILLIAM STAFFORD and SIR HUMPHREY, and soldiers\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"And you that love the commons, follow me.\n"+
		"Now show yourselves men; 'tis for liberty.\n"+
		"We will not leave one lord, one gentleman:\n"+
		"Spare none but such as go in clouted shoon;\n"+
		"For they are thrifty honest men, and such\n"+
		"As would, but that they dare not, take our parts.\n"+
		"DICK\n"+
		"They are all in order and march toward us.\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"But then are we in order when we are most\n"+
		"out of order. Come, march forward.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. Another part of Blackheath.\n"+
		"Alarums to the fight, wherein SIR HUMPHREY and WILLIAM STAFFORD are slain. Enter CADE and the rest\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"Where's Dick, the butcher of Ashford?\n"+
		"DICK\n"+
		"Here, sir.\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"They fell before thee like sheep and oxen, and thou\n"+
		"behavedst thyself as if thou hadst been in thine own\n"+
		"slaughter-house: therefore thus will I reward thee,\n"+
		"the Lent shall be as long again as it is; and thou\n"+
		"shalt have a licence to kill for a hundred lacking\n"+
		"one.\n"+
		"DICK\n"+
		"I desire no more.\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"And, to speak truth, thou deservest no less. This\n"+
		"monument of the victory will I bear;\n"+
		"Putting on SIR HUMPHREY'S brigandine\n"+
		"and the bodies shall be dragged at my horse' heels\n"+
		"till I do come to London, where we will have the\n"+
		"mayor's sword borne before us.\n"+
		"DICK\n"+
		"If we mean to thrive and do good, break open the\n"+
		"gaols and let out the prisoners.\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"Fear not that, I warrant thee. Come, let's march\n"+
		"towards London.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV. London. The palace.\n"+
		"Enter KING HENRY VI with a supplication, and the QUEEN with SUFFOLK'S head, BUCKINGHAM and Lord SAY\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Oft have I heard that grief softens the mind,\n"+

		"Think therefore on revenge and cease to weep.\n"+
		"But who can cease to weep and look on this?\n"+
		"Here may his head lie on my throbbing breast:\n"+
		"But where's the body that I should embrace?\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"What answer makes your grace to the rebels'\n"+
		"supplication?\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"I'll send some holy bishop to entreat;\n"+
		"For God forbid so many simple souls\n"+
		"Should perish by the sword! And I myself,\n"+
		"Rather than bloody war shall cut them short,\n"+
		"Will parley with Jack Cade their general:\n"+
		"But stay, I'll read it over once again.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Ah, barbarous villains! hath this lovely face\n"+
		"Ruled, like a wandering planet, over me,\n"+
		"And could it not enforce them to relent,\n"+
		"That were unworthy to behold the same?\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Lord Say, Jack Cade hath sworn to have thy head.\n"+
		"SAY\n"+
		"Ay, but I hope your highness shall have his.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"How now, madam!\n"+
		"Still lamenting and mourning for Suffolk's death?\n"+
		"I fear me, love, if that I had been dead,\n"+
		"Thou wouldst not have mourn'd so much for me.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"No, my love, I should not mourn, but die for thee.\n"+
		"Enter a Messenger\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"How now! what news? why comest thou in such haste?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"The rebels are in Southwark; fly, my lord!\n"+
		"Jack Cade proclaims himself Lord Mortimer,\n"+
		"Descended from the Duke of Clarence' house,\n"+
		"And calls your grace usurper openly\n"+
		"And vows to crown himself in Westminster.\n"+
		"His army is a ragged multitude\n"+
		"Of hinds and peasants, rude and merciless:\n"+
		"Sir Humphrey Stafford and h is brother's death\n"+
		"Hath given them heart and courage to proceed:\n"+
		"All scholars, lawyers, courtiers, gentlemen,\n"+
		"They call false caterpillars, and intend their death.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"O graceless men! they know not what they do.\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"My gracious lord, return to Killingworth,\n"+
		"Until a power be raised to put them down.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Ah, were the Duke of Suffolk now alive,\n"+
		"These Kentish rebels would be soon appeased!\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Lord Say, the traitors hate thee;\n"+
		"Therefore away with us to Killingworth.\n"+
		"SAY\n"+
		"So might your grace's person be in danger.\n"+
		"The sight of me is odious in their eyes;\n"+
		"And therefore in this city will I stay\n"+
		"And live alone as secret as I may.\n"+
		"Enter another Messenger\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Jack Cade hath gotten London bridge:\n"+
		"The citizens fly and forsake their houses:\n"+
		"The rascal people, thirsting after prey,\n"+
		"Join with the traitor, and they jointly swear\n"+

		"Come, Margaret; God, our hope, will succor us.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"My hope is gone, now Suffolk is deceased.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Farewell, my lord: trust not the Kentish rebels.\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Trust nobody, for fear you be betray'd.\n"+
		"SAY\n"+
		"The trust I have is in mine innocence,\n"+
		"And therefore am I bold and resolute.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE V. London. The Tower.\n"+
		"Enter SCALES upon the Tower, walking. Then enter two or three Citizens below\n"+
		"SCALES\n"+
		"How now! is Jack Cade slain?\n"+
		"First Citizen\n"+
		"No, my lord, nor likely to be slain; for they have\n"+
		"won the bridge, killing all those that withstand\n"+
		"them: the lord mayor craves aid of your honour from\n"+
		"the Tower, to defend the city from the rebels.\n"+
		"SCALES\n"+
		"Such aid as I can spare you shall command;\n"+
		"But I am troubled here with them myself;\n"+
		"The rebels have assay'd to win the Tower.\n"+
		"But get you to Smithfield, and gather head,\n"+

		"Exeunt\n"+

		"Enter CADE and the rest, and strikes his staff on London-stone\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"Now is Mortimer lord of this city. And here, sitting\n"+

		"My lord, there's an army gathered together in\n"+
		"Smithfield.\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"Come, then, let's go fight with them; but first, go\n"+

		"yet.\n"+
		"SMITH\n"+
		"[Aside] Nay, John, it will be stinking law for his\n"+
		"breath stinks with eating toasted cheese.\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"I have thought upon it, it shall be so. Away, burn\n"+
		"all the records of the realm: my mouth shall be\n"+

		"HOLLAND\n"+
		"[Aside] Then we are like to have biting statutes,\n"+

		"CADE\n"+
		"And henceforward all things shall be in common.\n"+
		"Enter a Messenger\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"My lord, a prize, a prize! here's the Lord Say,\n"+
		"which sold the towns in France; he that made us pay\n"+
		"one and twenty fifteens, and one shilling to the\n"+
		"pound, the last subsidy.\n"+
		"Enter BEVIS, with Lord SAY\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"Well, he shall be beheaded for it ten times. Ah,\n"+
		"thou say, thou serge, nay, thou buckram lord! now\n"+
		"art thou within point-blank of our jurisdiction\n"+
		"regal. What canst thou answer to my majesty for\n"+
		"giving up of Normandy unto Mounsieur Basimecu, the\n"+
		"dauphin of France? Be it known unto thee by these\n"+
		"presence, even the presence of Lord Mortimer, that I\n"+
		"am the besom that must sweep the court clean of such\n"+
		"filth as thou art. Thou hast most traitorously\n"+
		"corrupted the youth of the realm in erecting a\n"+
		"grammar school; and whereas, before, our forefathers\n"+
		"had no other books but the score and the tally, thou\n"+
		"hast caused printing to be used, and, contrary to\n"+
		"the king, his crown and dignity, thou hast built a\n"+
		"paper-mill. It will be proved to thy face that thou\n"+
		"hast men about thee that usually talk of a noun and\n"+
		"a verb, and such abominable words as no Christian\n"+
		"ear can endure to hear. Thou hast appointed\n"+
		"justices of peace, to call poor men before them\n"+
		"about matters they were not able to answer.\n"+
		"Moreover, thou hast put them in prison; and because\n"+
		"they could not read, thou hast hanged them; when,\n"+
		"indeed, only for that cause they have been most\n"+
		"worthy to live. Thou dost ride in a foot-cloth, dost thou not?\n"+
		"SAY\n"+
		"What of that?\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"Marry, thou oughtest not to let thy horse wear a\n"+
		"cloak, when honester men than thou go in their hose\n"+
		"and doublets.\n"+
		"DICK\n"+
		"And work in their shirt too; as myself, for example,\n"+
		"that am a butcher.\n"+
		"SAY\n"+
		"You men of Kent,--\n"+

		"What say you of Kent?\n"+
		"SAY\n"+
		"Nothing but this; 'tis 'bona terra, mala gens.'\n"+

		"Away with him, away with him! he speaks Latin.\n"+
		"SAY\n"+
		"Hear me but speak, and bear me where you will.\n"+
		"Kent, in the Commentaries Caesar writ,\n"+
		"Is term'd the civil'st place of this isle:\n"+
		"Sweet is the country, because full of riches;\n"+
		"The people liberal, valiant, active, wealthy;\n"+
		"Which makes me hope you are not void of pity.\n"+
		"I sold not Maine, I lost not Normandy,\n"+
		"Yet, to recover them, would lose my life.\n"+
		"Justice with favour have I always done;\n"+
		"Prayers and tears have moved me, gifts could never.\n"+
		"When have I aught exacted at your hands,\n"+
		"But to maintain the king, the realm and you?\n"+
		"Large gifts have I bestow'd on learned clerks,\n"+
		"Because my book preferr'd me to the king,\n"+
		"And seeing ignorance is the curse of God,\n"+
		"Knowledge the wing wherewith we fly to heaven,\n"+
		"Unless you be possess'd with devilish spirits,\n"+
		"You cannot but forbear to murder me:\n"+
		"This tongue hath parley'd unto foreign kings\n"+
		"For your behoof,--\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"Tut, when struck'st thou one blow in the field?\n"+
		"SAY\n"+
		"Great men have reaching hands: oft have I struck\n"+
		"Those that I never saw and struck them dead.\n"+
		"BEVIS\n"+
		"O monstrous coward! what, to come behind folks?\n"+
		"SAY\n"+
		"These cheeks are pale for watching for your good.\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"Give him a box o' the ear and that will make 'em red again.\n"+
		"SAY\n"+
		"Long sitting to determine poor men's causes\n"+

		"Ye shall have a hempen caudle, then, and the help of hatchet.\n"+
		"DICK\n"+
		"Why dost thou quiver, man?\n"+
		"SAY\n"+
		"The palsy, and not fear, provokes me.\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"Nay, he nods at us, as who should say, I'll be even\n"+
		"with you: I'll see if his head will stand steadier\n"+
		"on a pole, or no. Take him away, and behead him.\n"+
		"SAY\n"+
		"Tell me wherein have I offended most?\n"+
		"Have I affected wealth or honour? speak.\n"+
		"Are my chests fill'd up with extorted gold?\n"+
		"Is my apparel sumptuous to behold?\n"+
		"Whom have I injured, that ye seek my death?\n"+
		"These hands are free from guiltless bloodshedding,\n"+

		"CADE\n"+
		"[Aside] I feel remorse in myself with his words;\n"+

		"son-in-law's house, Sir James Cromer, and strike off\n"+
		"his head, and bring them both upon two poles hither.\n"+
		"ALL\n"+
		"It shall be done.\n"+

		"Ah, countrymen! if when you make your prayers,\n"+
		"God should be so obdurate as yourselves,\n"+
		"How would it fare with your departed souls?\n"+
		"And therefore yet relent, and save my life.\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"Away with him! and do as I command ye.\n"+
		"Exeunt some with Lord SAY\n"+
		"The proudest peer in the realm shall not wear a head\n"+
		"on his shoulders, unless he pay me tribute; there\n"+
		"shall not a maid be married, but she shall pay to me\n"+

		"Was ever feather so lightly blown to and fro as this\n"+
		"multitude? The name of Henry the Fifth hales them\n"+
		"to an hundred mischiefs, and makes them leave me\n"+
		"desolate. I see them lay their heads together to\n"+
		"surprise me. My sword make way for me, for here is\n"+
		"no staying. In despite of the devils and hell, have\n"+
		"through the very middest of you? and heavens and\n"+

		"Sound Trumpets. Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN MARGARET, and SOMERSET, on the terrace\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Was ever king that joy'd an earthly throne,\n"+
		"And could command no more content than I?\n"+
		"No sooner was I crept out of my cradle\n"+
		"But I was made a king, at nine months old.\n"+
		"Was never subject long'd to be a king\n"+
		"As I do long and wish to be a subject.\n"+
		"Enter BUCKINGHAM and CLIFFORD\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Health and glad tidings to your majesty!\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Why, Buckingham, is the traitor Cade surprised?\n"+
		"Or is he but retired to make him strong?\n"+
		"Enter below, multitudes, with halters about their necks\n"+
		"CLIFFORD\n"+
		"He is fled, my lord, and all his powers do yield;\n"+
		"And humbly thus, with halters on their necks,\n"+
		"Expect your highness' doom of life or death.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Then, heaven, set ope thy everlasting gates,\n"+
		"To entertain my vows of thanks and praise!\n"+
		"Soldiers, this day have you redeemed your lives,\n"+
		"And show'd how well you love your prince and country:\n"+
		"Continue still in this so good a mind,\n"+
		"And Henry, though he be infortunate,\n"+
		"Assure yourselves, will never be unkind:\n"+
		"And so, with thanks and pardon to you all,\n"+
		"I do dismiss you to your several countries.\n"+
		"ALL\n"+
		"God save the king! God save the king!\n"+
		"Enter a Messenger\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Please it your grace to be advertised\n"+
		"The Duke of York is newly come from Ireland,\n"+
		"And with a puissant and a mighty power\n"+
		"Of gallowglasses and stout kerns\n"+
		"Is marching hitherward in proud array,\n"+
		"And still proclaimeth, as he comes along,\n"+
		"His arms are only to remove from thee\n"+
		"The Duke of Somerset, whom he terms traitor.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Thus stands my state, 'twixt Cade and York distress'd.\n"+
		"Like to a ship that, having 'scaped a tempest,\n"+
		"Is straightway calm'd and boarded with a pirate:\n"+
		"But now is Cade driven back, his men dispersed;\n"+
		"And now is York in arms to second him.\n"+
		"I pray thee, Buckingham, go and meet him,\n"+
		"And ask him what's the reason of these arms.\n"+
		"Tell him I'll send Duke Edmund to the Tower;\n"+
		"And, Somerset, we'll commit thee thither,\n"+
		"Until his army be dismiss'd from him.\n"+
		"SOMERSET\n"+
		"My lord,\n"+
		"I'll yield myself to prison willingly,\n"+
		"Or unto death, to do my country good.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"In any case, be not too rough in terms;\n"+
		"For he is fierce and cannot brook hard language.\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"I will, my lord; and doubt not so to deal\n"+
		"As all things shall redound unto your good.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Come, wife, let's in, and learn to govern better;\n"+
		"For yet may England curse my wretched reign.\n"+

		"SCENE X. Kent. IDEN's garden.\n"+
		"Enter CADE\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"Fie on ambition! fie on myself, that have a sword,\n"+
		"and yet am ready to famish! These five days have I\n"+
		"hid me in these woods and durst not peep out, for\n"+
		"all the country is laid for me; but now am I so\n"+
		"hungry that if I might have a lease of my life for a\n"+
		"thousand years I could stay no longer. Wherefore,\n"+
		"on a brick wall have I climbed into this garden, to\n"+
		"see if I can eat grass, or pick a sallet another\n"+
		"while, which is not amiss to cool a man's stomach\n"+
		"this hot weather. And I think this word 'sallet'\n"+
		"was born to do me good: for many a time, but for a\n"+
		"sallet, my brainpan had been cleft with a brown\n"+
		"bill; and many a time, when I have been dry and\n"+
		"bravely marching, it hath served me instead of a\n"+
		"quart pot to drink in; and now the word 'sallet'\n"+
		"must serve me to feed on.\n"+
		"Enter IDEN\n"+
		"IDEN\n"+
		"Lord, who would live turmoiled in the court,\n"+
		"And may enjoy such quiet walks as these?\n"+
		"This small inheritance my father left me\n"+
		"Contenteth me, and worth a monarchy.\n"+
		"I seek not to wax great by others' waning,\n"+
		"Or gather wealth, I care not, with what envy:\n"+
		"Sufficeth that I have maintains my state\n"+
		"And sends the poor well pleased from my gate.\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"Here's the lord of the soil come to seize me for a\n"+
		"stray, for entering his fee-simple without leave.\n"+
		"Ah, villain, thou wilt betray me, and get a thousand\n"+
		"crowns of the king carrying my head to him: but\n"+
		"I'll make thee eat iron like an ostrich, and swallow\n"+
		"my sword like a great pin, ere thou and I part.\n"+
		"IDEN\n"+
		"Why, rude companion, whatsoe'er thou be,\n"+
		"I know thee not; why, then, should I betray thee?\n"+
		"Is't not enough to break into my garden,\n"+
		"And, like a thief, to come to rob my grounds,\n"+
		"Climbing my walls in spite of me the owner,\n"+
		"But thou wilt brave me with these saucy terms?\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"Brave thee! ay, by the best blood that ever was\n"+
		"broached, and beard thee too. Look on me well: I\n"+
		"have eat no meat these five days; yet, come thou and\n"+
		"thy five men, and if I do not leave you all as dead\n"+
		"as a doornail, I pray God I may never eat grass more.\n"+
		"IDEN\n"+
		"Nay, it shall ne'er be said, while England stands,\n"+
		"That Alexander Iden, an esquire of Kent,\n"+
		"Took odds to combat a poor famish'd man.\n"+
		"Oppose thy steadfast-gazing eyes to mine,\n"+
		"See if thou canst outface me with thy looks:\n"+
		"Set limb to limb, and thou art far the lesser;\n"+
		"Thy hand is but a finger to my fist,\n"+
		"Thy leg a stick compared with this truncheon;\n"+
		"My foot shall fight with all the strength thou hast;\n"+
		"And if mine arm be heaved in the air,\n"+
		"Thy grave is digg'd already in the earth.\n"+
		"As for words, whose greatness answers words,\n"+
		"Let this my sword report what speech forbears.\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"By my valour, the most complete champion that ever I\n"+
		"heard! Steel, if thou turn the edge, or cut not out\n"+
		"the burly-boned clown in chines of beef ere thou\n"+
		"sleep in thy sheath, I beseech God on my knees thou\n"+
		"mayst be turned to hobnails.\n"+
		"Here they fight. CADE falls\n"+
		"O, I am slain! famine and no other hath slain me:\n"+
		"let ten thousand devils come against me, and give me\n"+
		"but the ten meals I have lost, and I'll defy them\n"+
		"all. Wither, garden; and be henceforth a\n"+
		"burying-place to all that do dwell in this house,\n"+
		"because the unconquered soul of Cade is fled.\n"+
		"IDEN\n"+
		"Is't Cade that I have slain, that monstrous traitor?\n"+
		"Sword, I will hollow thee for this thy deed,\n"+
		"And hang thee o'er my tomb when I am dead:\n"+
		"Ne'er shall this blood be wiped from thy point;\n"+
		"But thou shalt wear it as a herald's coat,\n"+
		"To emblaze the honour that thy master got.\n"+
		"CADE\n"+
		"Iden, farewell, and be proud of thy victory. Tell\n"+
		"Kent from me, she hath lost her best man, and exhort\n"+
		"all the world to be cowards; for I, that never\n"+
		"feared any, am vanquished by famine, not by valour.\n"+
		"Dies\n"+
		"IDEN\n"+
		"How much thou wrong'st me, heaven be my judge.\n"+
		"Die, damned wretch, the curse of her that bare thee;\n"+
		"And as I thrust thy body in with my sword,\n"+
		"So wish I, I might thrust thy soul to hell.\n"+
		"Hence will I drag thee headlong by the heels\n"+
		"Unto a dunghill which shall be thy grave,\n"+
		"And there cut off thy most ungracious head;\n"+
		"Which I will bear in triumph to the king,\n"+
		"Leaving thy trunk for crows to feed upon.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"ACT V\n"+
		"SCENE I. Fields between Dartford and Blackheath.\n"+
		"Enter YORK, and his army of Irish, with drum and colours\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"From Ireland thus comes York to claim his right,\n"+
		"And pluck the crown from feeble Henry's head:\n"+
		"Ring, bells, aloud; burn, bonfires, clear and bright,\n"+
		"To entertain great England's lawful king.\n"+
		"Ah! sancta majestas, who would not buy thee dear?\n"+
		"Let them obey that know not how to rule;\n"+
		"This hand was made to handle naught but gold.\n"+
		"I cannot give due action to my words,\n"+
		"Except a sword or sceptre balance it:\n"+
		"A sceptre shall it have, have I a soul,\n"+
		"On which I'll toss the flower-de-luce of France.\n"+
		"Enter BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Whom have we here? Buckingham, to disturb me?\n"+
		"The king hath sent him, sure: I must dissemble.\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"York, if thou meanest well, I greet thee well.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"Humphrey of Buckingham, I accept thy greeting.\n"+
		"Art thou a messenger, or come of pleasure?\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"A messenger from Henry, our dread liege,\n"+
		"To know the reason of these arms in peace;\n"+
		"Or why thou, being a subject as I am,\n"+
		"Against thy oath and true allegiance sworn,\n"+
		"Should raise so great a power without his leave,\n"+
		"Or dare to bring thy force so near the court.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"[Aside] Scarce can I speak, my choler is so great:\n"+
		"O, I could hew up rocks and fight with flint,\n"+
		"I am so angry at these abject terms;\n"+
		"And now, like Ajax Telamonius,\n"+
		"On sheep or oxen could I spend my fury.\n"+
		"I am far better born than is the king,\n"+
		"More like a king, more kingly in my thoughts:\n"+
		"But I must make fair weather yet a while,\n"+
		"Till Henry be more weak and I more strong,--\n"+
		"Buckingham, I prithee, pardon me,\n"+
		"That I have given no answer all this while;\n"+
		"My mind was troubled with deep melancholy.\n"+
		"The cause why I have brought this army hither\n"+
		"Is to remove proud Somerset from the king,\n"+
		"Seditious to his grace and to the state.\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"That is too much presumption on thy part:\n"+
		"But if thy arms be to no other end,\n"+
		"The king hath yielded unto thy demand:\n"+
		"The Duke of Somerset is in the Tower.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"Upon thine honour, is he prisoner?\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"Upon mine honour, he is prisoner.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"Then, Buckingham, I do dismiss my powers.\n"+
		"Soldiers, I thank you all; disperse yourselves;\n"+
		"Meet me to-morrow in St. George's field,\n"+
		"You shall have pay and every thing you wish.\n"+
		"And let my sovereign, virtuous Henry,\n"+
		"Command my eldest son, nay, all my sons,\n"+
		"As pledges of my fealty and love;\n"+
		"I'll send them all as willing as I live:\n"+
		"Lands, goods, horse, armour, any thing I have,\n"+
		"Is his to use, so Somerset may die.\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"York, I commend this kind submission:\n"+
		"We twain will go into his highness' tent.\n"+
		"Enter KING HENRY VI and Attendants\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Buckingham, doth York intend no harm to us,\n"+
		"That thus he marcheth with thee arm in arm?\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"In all submission and humility\n"+
		"York doth present himself unto your highness.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Then what intends these forces thou dost bring?\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"To heave the traitor Somerset from hence,\n"+
		"And fight against that monstrous rebel Cade,\n"+
		"Who since I heard to be discomfited.\n"+
		"Enter IDEN, with CADE'S head\n"+
		"IDEN\n"+
		"If one so rude and of so mean condition\n"+
		"May pass into the presence of a king,\n"+
		"Lo, I present your grace a traitor's head,\n"+
		"The head of Cade, whom I in combat slew.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"The head of Cade! Great God, how just art Thou!\n"+
		"O, let me view his visage, being dead,\n"+
		"That living wrought me such exceeding trouble.\n"+
		"Tell me, my friend, art thou the man that slew him?\n"+
		"IDEN\n"+
		"I was, an't like your majesty.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"How art thou call'd? and what is thy degree?\n"+
		"IDEN\n"+
		"Alexander Iden, that's my name;\n"+
		"A poor esquire of Kent, that loves his king.\n"+
		"BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"So please it you, my lord, 'twere not amiss\n"+
		"He were created knight for his good service.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Iden, kneel down.\n"+
		"He kneels\n"+
		"Rise up a knight.\n"+
		"We give thee for reward a thousand marks,\n"+
		"And will that thou henceforth attend on us.\n"+
		"IDEN\n"+
		"May Iden live to merit such a bounty.\n"+
		"And never live but true unto his liege!\n"+
		"Rises\n"+
		"Enter QUEEN MARGARET and SOMERSET\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"See, Buckingham, Somerset comes with the queen:\n"+
		"Go, bid her hide him quickly from the duke.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"For thousand Yorks he shall not hide his head,\n"+
		"But boldly stand and front him to his face.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"How now! is Somerset at liberty?\n"+
		"Then, York, unloose thy long-imprison'd thoughts,\n"+
		"And let thy tongue be equal with thy heart.\n"+
		"Shall I endure the sight of Somerset?\n"+
		"False king! why hast thou broken faith with me,\n"+
		"Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse?\n"+
		"King did I call thee? no, thou art not king,\n"+
		"Not fit to govern and rule multitudes,\n"+
		"Which darest not, no, nor canst not rule a traitor.\n"+
		"That head of thine doth not become a crown;\n"+
		"Thy hand is made to grasp a palmer's staff,\n"+
		"And not to grace an awful princely sceptre.\n"+
		"That gold must round engirt these brows of mine,\n"+
		"Whose smile and frown, like to Achilles' spear,\n"+
		"Is able with the change to kill and cure.\n"+
		"Here is a hand to hold a sceptre up\n"+
		"And with the same to act controlling laws.\n"+
		"Give place: by heaven, thou shalt rule no more\n"+
		"O'er him whom heaven created for thy ruler.\n"+
		"SOMERSET\n"+
		"O monstrous traitor! I arrest thee, York,\n"+
		"Of capital treason 'gainst the king and crown;\n"+
		"Obey, audacious traitor; kneel for grace.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"Wouldst have me kneel? first let me ask of these,\n"+
		"If they can brook I bow a knee to man.\n"+
		"Sirrah, call in my sons to be my bail;\n"+
		"Exit Attendant\n"+
		"I know, ere they will have me go to ward,\n"+
		"They'll pawn their swords for my enfranchisement.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Call hither Clifford! bid him come amain,\n"+
		"To say if that the bastard boys of York\n"+
		"Shall be the surety for their traitor father.\n"+
		"Exit BUCKINGHAM\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"O blood-besotted Neapolitan,\n"+
		"Outcast of Naples, England's bloody scourge!\n"+
		"The sons of York, thy betters in their birth,\n"+
		"Shall be their father's bail; and bane to those\n"+
		"That for my surety will refuse the boys!\n"+
		"Enter EDWARD and RICHARD\n"+
		"See where they come: I'll warrant they'll\n"+
		"make it good.\n"+
		"Enter CLIFFORD and YOUNG CLIFFORD\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"And here comes Clifford to deny their bail.\n"+
		"CLIFFORD\n"+
		"Health and all happiness to my lord the king!\n"+
		"Kneels\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"I thank thee, Clifford: say, what news with thee?\n"+
		"Nay, do not fright us with an angry look;\n"+
		"We are thy sovereign, Clifford, kneel again;\n"+
		"For thy mistaking so, we pardon thee.\n"+
		"CLIFFORD\n"+
		"This is my king, York, I do not mistake;\n"+
		"But thou mistakest me much to think I do:\n"+
		"To Bedlam with him! is the man grown mad?\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Ay, Clifford; a bedlam and ambitious humour\n"+
		"Makes him oppose himself against his king.\n"+
		"CLIFFORD\n"+
		"He is a traitor; let him to the Tower,\n"+
		"And chop away that factious pate of his.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"He is arrested, but will not obey;\n"+
		"His sons, he says, shall give their words for him.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"Will you not, sons?\n"+
		"EDWARD\n"+
		"Ay, noble father, if our words will serve.\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"And if words will not, then our weapons shall.\n"+
		"CLIFFORD\n"+
		"Why, what a brood of traitors have we here!\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"Look in a glass, and call thy image so:\n"+
		"I am thy king, and thou a false-heart traitor.\n"+
		"Call hither to the stake my two brave bears,\n"+
		"That with the very shaking of their chains\n"+
		"They may astonish these fell-lurking curs:\n"+
		"Bid Salisbury and Warwick come to me.\n"+
		"Enter the WARWICK and SALISBURY\n"+
		"CLIFFORD\n"+
		"Are these thy bears? we'll bait thy bears to death.\n"+
		"And manacle the bear-ward in their chains,\n"+
		"If thou darest bring them to the baiting place.\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"Oft have I seen a hot o'erweening cur\n"+
		"Run back and bite, because he was withheld;\n"+
		"Who, being suffer'd with the bear's fell paw,\n"+
		"Hath clapp'd his tail between his legs and cried:\n"+
		"And such a piece of service will you do,\n"+
		"If you oppose yourselves to match Lord Warwick.\n"+
		"CLIFFORD\n"+
		"Hence, heap of wrath, foul indigested lump,\n"+
		"As crooked in thy manners as thy shape!\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"Nay, we shall heat you thoroughly anon.\n"+
		"CLIFFORD\n"+
		"Take heed, lest by your heat you burn yourselves.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Why, Warwick, hath thy knee forgot to bow?\n"+
		"Old Salisbury, shame to thy silver hair,\n"+
		"Thou mad misleader of thy brain-sick son!\n"+
		"What, wilt thou on thy death-bed play the ruffian,\n"+
		"And seek for sorrow with thy spectacles?\n"+
		"O, where is faith? O, where is loyalty?\n"+
		"If it be banish'd from the frosty head,\n"+
		"Where shall it find a harbour in the earth?\n"+
		"Wilt thou go dig a grave to find out war,\n"+
		"And shame thine honourable age with blood?\n"+
		"Why art thou old, and want'st experience?\n"+
		"Or wherefore dost abuse it, if thou hast it?\n"+
		"For shame! in duty bend thy knee to me\n"+
		"That bows unto the grave with mickle age.\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"My lord, I have consider'd with myself\n"+
		"The title of this most renowned duke;\n"+
		"And in my conscience do repute his grace\n"+
		"The rightful heir to England's royal seat.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me?\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"I have.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Canst thou dispense with heaven for such an oath?\n"+
		"SALISBURY\n"+
		"It is great sin to swear unto a sin,\n"+
		"But greater sin to keep a sinful oath.\n"+
		"Who can be bound by any solemn vow\n"+
		"To do a murderous deed, to rob a man,\n"+
		"To force a spotless virgin's chastity,\n"+
		"To reave the orphan of his patrimony,\n"+
		"To wring the widow from her custom'd right,\n"+
		"And have no other reason for this wrong\n"+
		"But that he was bound by a solemn oath?\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"A subtle traitor needs no sophister.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Call Buckingham, and bid him arm himself.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"Call Buckingham, and all the friends thou hast,\n"+
		"I am resolved for death or dignity.\n"+
		"CLIFFORD\n"+
		"The first I warrant thee, if dreams prove true.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"You were best to go to bed and dream again,\n"+
		"To keep thee from the tempest of the field.\n"+
		"CLIFFORD\n"+
		"I am resolved to bear a greater storm\n"+
		"Than any thou canst conjure up to-day;\n"+
		"And that I'll write upon thy burgonet,\n"+
		"Might I but know thee by thy household badge.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Now, by my father's badge, old Nevil's crest,\n"+
		"The rampant bear chain'd to the ragged staff,\n"+
		"This day I'll wear aloft my burgonet,\n"+
		"As on a mountain top the cedar shows\n"+
		"That keeps his leaves in spite of any storm,\n"+
		"Even to affright thee with the view thereof.\n"+
		"CLIFFORD\n"+
		"And from thy burgonet I'll rend thy bear\n"+
		"And tread it under foot with all contempt,\n"+
		"Despite the bear-ward that protects the bear.\n"+
		"YOUNG CLIFFORD\n"+
		"And so to arms, victorious father,\n"+
		"To quell the rebels and their complices.\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"Fie! charity, for shame! speak not in spite,\n"+
		"For you shall sup with Jesu Christ to-night.\n"+
		"YOUNG CLIFFORD\n"+
		"Foul stigmatic, that's more than thou canst tell.\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"If not in heaven, you'll surely sup in hell.\n"+
		"Exeunt severally\n"+
		"SCENE II. Saint Alban's.\n"+
		"Alarums to the battle. Enter WARWICK\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Clifford of Cumberland, 'tis Warwick calls:\n"+

		"And dead men's cries do fill the empty air,\n"+
		"Clifford, I say, come forth and fight with me:\n"+
		"Proud northern lord, Clifford of Cumberland,\n"+
		"Warwick is hoarse with calling thee to arms.\n"+
		"Enter YORK\n"+
		"How now, my noble lord? what, all afoot?\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"The deadly-handed Clifford slew my steed,\n"+
		"But match to match I have encounter'd him\n"+

		"Enter CLIFFORD\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Of one or both of us the time is come.\n"+

		"WARWICK\n"+
		"I wonder how the king escaped our hands.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"While we pursued the horsemen of the north,\n"+
		"He slily stole away and left his men:\n"+
		"Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland,\n"+
		"Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat,\n"+
		"Cheer'd up the drooping army; and himself,\n"+
		"Lord Clifford and Lord Stafford, all abreast,\n"+
		"Charged our main battle's front, and breaking in\n"+
		"Were by the swords of common soldiers slain.\n"+
		"EDWARD\n"+
		"Lord Stafford's father, Duke of Buckingham,\n"+

		"Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt!\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"Thus do I hope to shake King Henry's head.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"And so do I. Victorious Prince of York,\n"+
		"Before I see thee seated in that throne\n"+
		"Which now the house of Lancaster usurps,\n"+
		"I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close.\n"+
		"This is the palace of the fearful king,\n"+
		"And this the regal seat: possess it, York;\n"+
		"For this is thine and not King Henry's heirs'\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"Assist me, then, sweet Warwick, and I will;\n"+
		"For hither we have broken in by force.\n"+
		"NORFOLK\n"+
		"We'll all assist you; he that flies shall die.\n"+

		"Arm'd as we are, let's stay within this house.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"The bloody parliament shall this be call'd,\n"+
		"Unless Plantagenet, Duke of York, be king,\n"+
		"And bashful Henry deposed, whose cowardice\n"+
		"Hath made us by-words to our enemies.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"Then leave me not, my lords; be resolute;\n"+
		"I mean to take possession of my right.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Neither the king, nor he that loves him best,\n"+
		"The proudest he that holds up Lancaster,\n"+
		"Dares stir a wing, if Warwick shake his bells.\n"+
		"I'll plant Plantagenet, root him up who dares:\n"+
		"Resolve thee, Richard; claim the English crown.\n"+
		"Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI, CLIFFORD, NORTHUMBERLAND, WESTMORELAND, EXETER, and the rest\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,\n"+
		"Even in the chair of state: belike he means,\n"+
		"Back'd by the power of Warwick, that false peer,\n"+
		"To aspire unto the crown and reign as king.\n"+
		"Earl of Northumberland, he slew thy father.\n"+
		"And thine, Lord Clifford; and you both have vow'd revenge\n"+
		"On him, his sons, his favourites and his friends.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"If I be not, heavens be revenged on me!\n"+
		"CLIFFORD\n"+
		"The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel.\n"+
		"WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"What, shall we suffer this? let's pluck him down:\n"+
		"My heart for anger burns; I cannot brook it.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmoreland.\n"+
		"CLIFFORD\n"+
		"Patience is for poltroons, such as he:\n"+
		"He durst not sit there, had your father lived.\n"+
		"My gracious lord, here in the parliament\n"+
		"Let us assail the family of York.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"Well hast thou spoken, cousin: be it so.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Ah, know you not the city favours them,\n"+
		"And they have troops of soldiers at their beck?\n"+
		"EXETER\n"+
		"But when the duke is slain, they'll quickly fly.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Far be the thought of this from Henry's heart,\n"+
		"To make a shambles of the parliament-house!\n"+
		"Cousin of Exeter, frowns, words and threats\n"+
		"Shall be the war that Henry means to use.\n"+
		"Thou factious Duke of York, descend my throne,\n"+
		"and kneel for grace and mercy at my feet;\n"+
		"I am thy sovereign.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"I am thine.\n"+
		"EXETER\n"+
		"For shame, come down: he made thee Duke of York.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"'Twas my inheritance, as the earldom was.\n"+
		"EXETER\n"+
		"Thy father was a traitor to the crown.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown\n"+
		"In following this usurping Henry.\n"+
		"CLIFFORD\n"+
		"Whom should he follow but his natural king?\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"True, Clifford; and that's Richard Duke of York.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"It must and shall be so: content thyself.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Be Duke of Lancaster; let him be king.\n"+
		"WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"He is both king and Duke of Lancaster;\n"+
		"And that the Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget\n"+
		"That we are those which chased you from the field\n"+
		"And slew your fathers, and with colours spread\n"+
		"March'd through the city to the palace gates.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief;\n"+
		"And, by his soul, thou and thy house shall rue it.\n"+
		"WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"Plantagenet, of thee and these thy sons,\n"+
		"Thy kinsman and thy friends, I'll have more lives\n"+
		"Than drops of blood were in my father's veins.\n"+
		"CLIFFORD\n"+
		"Urge it no more; lest that, instead of words,\n"+
		"I send thee, Warwick, such a messenger\n"+
		"As shall revenge his death before I stir.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Poor Clifford! how I scorn his worthless threats!\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"Will you we show our title to the crown?\n"+
		"If not, our swords shall plead it in the field.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?\n"+
		"Thy father was, as thou art, Duke of York;\n"+
		"Thy grandfather, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March:\n"+
		"I am the son of Henry the Fifth,\n"+
		"Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop\n"+
		"And seized upon their towns and provinces.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"The lord protector lost it, and not I:\n"+
		"When I was crown'd I was but nine months old.\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"You are old enough now, and yet, methinks, you lose.\n"+
		"Father, tear the crown from the usurper's head.\n"+
		"EDWARD\n"+
		"Sweet father, do so; set it on your head.\n"+
		"MONTAGUE\n"+
		"Good brother, as thou lovest and honourest arms,\n"+
		"Let's fight it out and not stand cavilling thus.\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"Sound drums and trumpets, and the king will fly.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"Sons, peace!\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Peace, thou! and give King Henry leave to speak.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Plantagenet shall speak first: hear him, lords;\n"+
		"And be you silent and attentive too,\n"+
		"For he that interrupts him shall not live.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,\n"+
		"Wherein my grandsire and my father sat?\n"+
		"No: first shall war unpeople this my realm;\n"+
		"Ay, and their colours, often borne in France,\n"+
		"And now in England to our heart's great sorrow,\n"+
		"Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords?\n"+
		"My title's good, and better far than his.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be king.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"'Twas by rebellion against his king.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"[Aside] I know not what to say; my title's weak.--\n"+
		"Tell me, may not a king adopt an heir?\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"What then?\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"An if he may, then am I lawful king;\n"+
		"For Richard, in the view of many lords,\n"+
		"Resign'd the crown to Henry the Fourth,\n"+
		"Whose heir my father was, and I am his.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"He rose against him, being his sovereign,\n"+
		"And made him to resign his crown perforce.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain'd,\n"+
		"Think you 'twere prejudicial to his crown?\n"+
		"EXETER\n"+
		"No; for he could not so resign his crown\n"+
		"But that the next heir should succeed and reign.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter?\n"+
		"EXETER\n"+
		"His is the right, and therefore pardon me.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not?\n"+
		"EXETER\n"+
		"My conscience tells me he is lawful king.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"[Aside] All will revolt from me, and turn to him.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"Plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay'st,\n"+
		"Think not that Henry shall be so deposed.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Deposed he shall be, in despite of all.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"Thou art deceived: 'tis not thy southern power,\n"+
		"Of Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, nor of Kent,\n"+
		"Which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud,\n"+
		"Can set the duke up in despite of me.\n"+
		"CLIFFORD\n"+
		"King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,\n"+
		"Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence:\n"+
		"May that ground gape and swallow me alive,\n"+
		"Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father!\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart!\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown.\n"+
		"What mutter you, or what conspire you, lords?\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Do right unto this princely Duke of York,\n"+
		"Or I will fill the house with armed men,\n"+
		"And over the chair of state, where now he sits,\n"+
		"Write up his title with usurping blood.\n"+
		"He stamps with his foot and the soldiers show themselves\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"My Lord of Warwick, hear me but one word:\n"+
		"Let me for this my life-time reign as king.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs,\n"+
		"And thou shalt reign in quiet while thou livest.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"I am content: Richard Plantagenet,\n"+
		"Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.\n"+
		"CLIFFORD\n"+
		"What wrong is this unto the prince your son!\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"What good is this to England and himself!\n"+
		"WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"Base, fearful and despairing Henry!\n"+
		"CLIFFORD\n"+
		"How hast thou injured both thyself and us!\n"+
		"WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"I cannot stay to hear these articles.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"Nor I.\n"+
		"CLIFFORD\n"+
		"Come, cousin, let us tell the queen these news.\n"+
		"WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"Farewell, faint-hearted and degenerate king,\n"+
		"In whose cold blood no spark of honour bides.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"Be thou a prey unto the house of York,\n"+
		"And die in bands for this unmanly deed!\n"+
		"CLIFFORD\n"+
		"In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome,\n"+
		"Or live in peace abandon'd and despised!\n"+
		"Exeunt NORTHUMBERLAND, CLIFFORD, and WESTMORELAND\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Turn this way, Henry, and regard them not.\n"+
		"EXETER\n"+
		"They seek revenge and therefore will not yield.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Ah, Exeter!\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Why should you sigh, my lord?\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Not for myself, Lord Warwick, but my son,\n"+
		"Whom I unnaturally shall disinherit.\n"+
		"But be it as it may: I here entail\n"+
		"The crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever;\n"+
		"Conditionally, that here thou take an oath\n"+
		"To cease this civil war, and, whilst I live,\n"+
		"To honour me as thy king and sovereign,\n"+
		"And neither by treason nor hostility\n"+
		"To seek to put me down and reign thyself.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"This oath I willingly take and will perform.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Long live King Henry! Plantagenet embrace him.\n"+

		"EXETER\n"+
		"Accursed be he that seeks to make them foes!\n"+
		"Sennet. Here they come down\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"Farewell, my gracious lord; I'll to my castle.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"And I'll keep London with my soldiers.\n"+
		"NORFOLK\n"+
		"And I to Norfolk with my followers.\n"+
		"MONTAGUE\n"+
		"And I unto the sea from whence I came.\n"+
		"Exeunt YORK, EDWARD, EDMUND, GEORGE, RICHARD, WARWICK, NORFOLK, MONTAGUE, their Soldiers, and Attendants\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"And I, with grief and sorrow, to the court.\n"+
		"Enter QUEEN MARGARET and PRINCE EDWARD\n"+
		"EXETER\n"+
		"Here comes the queen, whose looks bewray her anger:\n"+
		"I'll steal away.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Exeter, so will I.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Nay, go not from me; I will follow thee.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Be patient, gentle queen, and I will stay.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Who can be patient in such extremes?\n"+
		"Ah, wretched man! would I had died a maid\n"+
		"And never seen thee, never borne thee son,\n"+
		"Seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father\n"+
		"Hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus?\n"+
		"Hadst thou but loved him half so well as I,\n"+
		"Or felt that pain which I did for him once,\n"+
		"Or nourish'd him as I did with my blood,\n"+
		"Thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blood there,\n"+
		"Rather than have that savage duke thine heir\n"+
		"And disinherited thine only son.\n"+
		"PRINCE EDWARD\n"+
		"Father, you cannot disinherit me:\n"+
		"If you be king, why should not I succeed?\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Pardon me, Margaret; pardon me, sweet son:\n"+
		"The Earl of Warwick and the duke enforced me.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Enforced thee! art thou king, and wilt be forced?\n"+
		"I shame to hear thee speak. Ah, timorous wretch!\n"+
		"Thou hast undone thyself, thy son and me;\n"+
		"And given unto the house of York such head\n"+
		"As thou shalt reign but by their sufferance.\n"+
		"To entail him and his heirs unto the crown,\n"+
		"What is it, but to make thy sepulchre\n"+
		"And creep into it far before thy time?\n"+
		"Warwick is chancellor and the lord of Calais;\n"+
		"Stern Falconbridge commands the narrow seas;\n"+
		"The duke is made protector of the realm;\n"+
		"And yet shalt thou be safe? such safety finds\n"+
		"The trembling lamb environed with wolves.\n"+
		"Had I been there, which am a silly woman,\n"+
		"The soldiers should have toss'd me on their pikes\n"+
		"Before I would have granted to that act.\n"+
		"But thou preferr'st thy life before thine honour:\n"+
		"And seeing thou dost, I here divorce myself\n"+
		"Both from thy table, Henry, and thy bed,\n"+
		"Until that act of parliament be repeal'd\n"+
		"Whereby my son is disinherited.\n"+
		"The northern lords that have forsworn thy colours\n"+
		"Will follow mine, if once they see them spread;\n"+
		"And spread they shall be, to thy foul disgrace\n"+
		"And utter ruin of the house of York.\n"+
		"Thus do I leave thee. Come, son, let's away;\n"+
		"Our army is ready; come, we'll after them.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Stay, gentle Margaret, and hear me speak.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Thou hast spoke too much already: get thee gone.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Gentle son Edward, thou wilt stay with me?\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Ay, to be murder'd by his enemies.\n"+
		"PRINCE EDWARD\n"+
		"When I return with victory from the field\n"+
		"I'll see your grace: till then I'll follow her.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Come, son, away; we may not linger thus.\n"+
		"Exeunt QUEEN MARGARET and PRINCE EDWARD\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Poor queen! how love to me and to her son\n"+
		"Hath made her break out into terms of rage!\n"+
		"Revenged may she be on that hateful duke,\n"+
		"Whose haughty spirit, winged with desire,\n"+
		"Will cost my crown, and like an empty eagle\n"+
		"Tire on the flesh of me and of my son!\n"+
		"The loss of those three lords torments my heart:\n"+
		"I'll write unto them and entreat them fair.\n"+

		"RICHARD\n"+
		"Brother, though I be youngest, give me leave.\n"+
		"EDWARD\n"+
		"No, I can better play the orator.\n"+

		"But I have reasons strong and forcible.\n"+
		"Enter YORK\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"Why, how now, sons and brother! at a strife?\n"+
		"What is your quarrel? how began it first?\n"+
		"EDWARD\n"+
		"No quarrel, but a slight contention.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"About what?\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"About that which concerns your grace and us;\n"+
		"The crown of England, father, which is yours.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"Mine boy? not till King Henry be dead.\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"Your right depends not on his life or death.\n"+
		"EDWARD\n"+
		"Now you are heir, therefore enjoy it now:\n"+
		"By giving the house of Lancaster leave to breathe,\n"+
		"It will outrun you, father, in the end.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"I took an oath that he should quietly reign.\n"+
		"EDWARD\n"+
		"But for a kingdom any oath may be broken:\n"+
		"I would break a thousand oaths to reign one year.\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"No; God forbid your grace should be forsworn.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"I shall be, if I claim by open war.\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"I'll prove the contrary, if you'll hear me speak.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"Thou canst not, son; it is impossible.\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"An oath is of no moment, being not took\n"+
		"Before a true and lawful magistrate,\n"+
		"That hath authority over him that swears:\n"+
		"Henry had none, but did usurp the place;\n"+
		"Then, seeing 'twas he that made you to depose,\n"+
		"Your oath, my lord, is vain and frivolous.\n"+
		"Therefore, to arms! And, father, do but think\n"+
		"How sweet a thing it is to wear a crown;\n"+
		"Within whose circuit is Elysium\n"+
		"And all that poets feign of bliss and joy.\n"+
		"Why do we finger thus? I cannot rest\n"+
		"Until the white rose that I wear be dyed\n"+
		"Even in the lukewarm blood of Henry's heart.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"Richard, enough; I will be king, or die.\n"+
		"Brother, thou shalt to London presently,\n"+
		"And whet on Warwick to this enterprise.\n"+
		"Thou, Richard, shalt to the Duke of Norfolk,\n"+
		"And tell him privily of our intent.\n"+
		"You Edward, shall unto my Lord Cobham,\n"+
		"With whom the Kentishmen will willingly rise:\n"+
		"In them I trust; for they are soldiers,\n"+
		"Witty, courteous, liberal, full of spirit.\n"+
		"While you are thus employ'd, what resteth more,\n"+
		"But that I seek occasion how to rise,\n"+
		"And yet the king not privy to my drift,\n"+
		"Nor any of the house of Lancaster?\n"+
		"Enter a Messenger\n"+
		"But, stay: what news? Why comest thou in such post?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"The queen with all the northern earls and lords\n"+
		"Intend here to besiege you in your castle:\n"+
		"She is hard by with twenty thousand men;\n"+
		"And therefore fortify your hold, my lord.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"Ay, with my sword. What! think'st thou that we fear them?\n"+
		"Edward and Richard, you shall stay with me;\n"+
		"My brother Montague shall post to London:\n"+
		"Let noble Warwick, Cobham, and the rest,\n"+
		"Whom we have left protectors of the king,\n"+
		"With powerful policy strengthen themselves,\n"+
		"And trust not simple Henry nor his oaths.\n"+
		"MONTAGUE\n"+
		"Brother, I go; I'll win them, fear it not:\n"+

		"Exit\n"+
		"Enter JOHN MORTIMER and HUGH MORTIMER\n"+
		"Sir John and Sir Hugh Mortimer, mine uncles,\n"+
		"You are come to Sandal in a happy hour;\n"+
		"The army of the queen mean to besiege us.\n"+
		"JOHN MORTIMER\n"+
		"She shall not need; we'll meet her in the field.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"What, with five thousand men?\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"Ay, with five hundred, father, for a need:\n"+
		"A woman's general; what should we fear?\n"+
		"A march afar off\n"+
		"EDWARD\n"+
		"I hear their drums: let's set our men in order,\n"+
		"And issue forth and bid them battle straight.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"Five men to twenty! though the odds be great,\n"+
		"I doubt not, uncle, of our victory.\n"+
		"Many a battle have I won in France,\n"+
		"When as the enemy hath been ten to one:\n"+
		"Why should I not now have the like success?\n"+
		"Alarum. Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. Field of battle betwixt Sandal Castle and Wakefield.\n"+
		"Alarums. Enter RUTLAND and his Tutor\n"+
		"RUTLAND\n"+
		"Ah, whither shall I fly to 'scape their hands?\n"+
		"Ah, tutor, look where bloody Clifford comes!\n"+
		"Enter CLIFFORD and Soldiers\n"+
		"CLIFFORD\n"+
		"Chaplain, away! thy priesthood saves thy life.\n"+
		"As for the brat of this accursed duke,\n"+
		"Whose father slew my father, he shall die.\n"+
		"Tutor\n"+
		"And I, my lord, will bear him company.\n"+
		"CLIFFORD\n"+
		"Soldiers, away with him!\n"+
		"Tutor\n"+
		"Ah, Clifford, murder not this innocent child,\n"+
		"Lest thou be hated both of God and man!\n"+
		"Exit, dragged off by Soldiers\n"+
		"CLIFFORD\n"+
		"How now! is he dead already? or is it fear\n"+
		"That makes him close his eyes? I'll open them.\n"+
		"RUTLAND\n"+
		"So looks the pent-up lion o'er the wretch\n"+
		"That trembles under his devouring paws;\n"+
		"And so he walks, insulting o'er his prey,\n"+
		"And so he comes, to rend his limbs asunder.\n"+
		"Ah, gentle Clifford, kill me with thy sword,\n"+
		"And not with such a cruel threatening look.\n"+
		"Sweet Clifford, hear me speak before I die.\n"+
		"I am too mean a subject for thy wrath:\n"+
		"Be thou revenged on men, and let me live.\n"+
		"CLIFFORD\n"+
		"In vain thou speak'st, poor boy; my father's blood\n"+
		"Hath stopp'd the passage where thy words should enter.\n"+
		"RUTLAND\n"+
		"Then let my father's blood open it again:\n"+
		"He is a man, and, Clifford, cope with him.\n"+
		"CLIFFORD\n"+
		"Had thy brethren here, their lives and thine\n"+
		"Were not revenge sufficient for me;\n"+
		"No, if I digg'd up thy forefathers' graves\n"+
		"And hung their rotten coffins up in chains,\n"+
		"It could not slake mine ire, nor ease my heart.\n"+
		"The sight of any of the house of York\n"+
		"Is as a fury to torment my soul;\n"+
		"And till I root out their accursed line\n"+
		"And leave not one alive, I live in hell.\n"+
		"Therefore--\n"+
		"Lifting his hand\n"+
		"RUTLAND\n"+
		"O, let me pray before I take my death!\n"+
		"To thee I pray; sweet Clifford, pity me!\n"+
		"CLIFFORD\n"+
		"Such pity as my rapier's point affords.\n"+
		"RUTLAND\n"+
		"I never did thee harm: why wilt thou slay me?\n"+
		"CLIFFORD\n"+
		"Thy father hath.\n"+
		"RUTLAND\n"+
		"But 'twas ere I was born.\n"+
		"Thou hast one son; for his sake pity me,\n"+
		"Lest in revenge thereof, sith God is just,\n"+
		"He be as miserably slain as I.\n"+
		"Ah, let me live in prison all my days;\n"+
		"And when I give occasion of offence,\n"+
		"Then let me die, for now thou hast no cause.\n"+
		"CLIFFORD\n"+
		"No cause!\n"+
		"Thy father slew my father; therefore, die.\n"+
		"Stabs him\n"+
		"RUTLAND\n"+
		"Di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae!\n"+
		"Dies\n"+
		"CLIFFORD\n"+
		"Plantagenet! I come, Plantagenet!\n"+
		"And this thy son's blood cleaving to my blade\n"+
		"Shall rust upon my weapon, till thy blood,\n"+
		"Congeal'd with this, do make me wipe off both.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE IV. Another part of the field.\n"+
		"Alarum. Enter YORK\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"The army of the queen hath got the field:\n"+
		"My uncles both are slain in rescuing me;\n"+
		"And all my followers to the eager foe\n"+
		"Turn back and fly, like ships before the wind\n"+
		"Or lambs pursued by hunger-starved wolves.\n"+
		"My sons, God knows what hath bechanced them:\n"+
		"But this I know, they have demean'd themselves\n"+
		"Like men born to renown by life or death.\n"+
		"Three times did Richard make a lane to me.\n"+
		"And thrice cried 'Courage, father! fight it out!'\n"+
		"And full as oft came Edward to my side,\n"+
		"With purple falchion, painted to the hilt\n"+
		"In blood of those that had encounter'd him:\n"+
		"And when the hardiest warriors did retire,\n"+
		"Richard cried 'Charge! and give no foot of ground!'\n"+
		"And cried 'A crown, or else a glorious tomb!\n"+
		"A sceptre, or an earthly sepulchre!'\n"+
		"With this, we charged again: but, out, alas!\n"+
		"We bodged again; as I have seen a swan\n"+
		"With bootless labour swim against the tide\n"+
		"And spend her strength with over-matching waves.\n"+
		"A short alarum within\n"+
		"Ah, hark! the fatal followers do pursue;\n"+
		"And I am faint and cannot fly their fury:\n"+
		"And were I strong, I would not shun their fury:\n"+
		"The sands are number'd that make up my life;\n"+
		"Here must I stay, and here my life must end.\n"+
		"Enter QUEEN MARGARET, CLIFFORD, NORTHUMBERLAND, PRINCE EDWARD, and Soldiers\n"+
		"Come, bloody Clifford, rough Northumberland,\n"+
		"I dare your quenchless fury to more rage:\n"+
		"I am your butt, and I abide your shot.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"Yield to our mercy, proud Plantagenet.\n"+
		"CLIFFORD\n"+
		"Ay, to such mercy as his ruthless arm,\n"+
		"With downright payment, show'd unto my father.\n"+
		"Now Phaethon hath tumbled from his car,\n"+
		"And made an evening at the noontide prick.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"My ashes, as the phoenix, may bring forth\n"+
		"A bird that will revenge upon you all:\n"+
		"And in that hope I throw mine eyes to heaven,\n"+
		"Scorning whate'er you can afflict me with.\n"+
		"Why come you not? what! multitudes, and fear?\n"+
		"CLIFFORD\n"+
		"So cowards fight when they can fly no further;\n"+
		"So doves do peck the falcon's piercing talons;\n"+
		"So desperate thieves, all hopeless of their lives,\n"+
		"Breathe out invectives 'gainst the officers.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"O Clifford, but bethink thee once again,\n"+
		"And in thy thought o'er-run my former time;\n"+
		"And, if though canst for blushing, view this face,\n"+
		"And bite thy tongue, that slanders him with cowardice\n"+
		"Whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this!\n"+
		"CLIFFORD\n"+
		"I will not bandy with thee word for word,\n"+
		"But buckle with thee blows, twice two for one.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Hold, valiant Clifford! for a thousand causes\n"+
		"I would prolong awhile the traitor's life.\n"+
		"Wrath makes him deaf: speak thou, Northumberland.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"Hold, Clifford! do not honour him so much\n"+
		"To prick thy finger, though to wound his heart:\n"+
		"What valour were it, when a cur doth grin,\n"+
		"For one to thrust his hand between his teeth,\n"+
		"When he might spurn him with his foot away?\n"+
		"It is war's prize to take all vantages;\n"+
		"And ten to one is no impeach of valour.\n"+
		"They lay hands on YORK, who struggles\n"+
		"CLIFFORD\n"+
		"Ay, ay, so strives the woodcock with the gin.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"So doth the cony struggle in the net.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"So triumph thieves upon their conquer'd booty;\n"+
		"So true men yield, with robbers so o'ermatch'd.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"What would your grace have done unto him now?\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Brave warriors, Clifford and Northumberland,\n"+
		"Come, make him stand upon this molehill here,\n"+
		"That raught at mountains with outstretched arms,\n"+
		"Yet parted but the shadow with his hand.\n"+
		"What! was it you that would be England's king?\n"+
		"Was't you that revell'd in our parliament,\n"+
		"And made a preachment of your high descent?\n"+
		"Where are your mess of sons to back you now?\n"+
		"The wanton Edward, and the lusty George?\n"+
		"And where's that valiant crook-back prodigy,\n"+
		"Dicky your boy, that with his grumbling voice\n"+
		"Was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies?\n"+
		"Or, with the rest, where is your darling Rutland?\n"+
		"Look, York: I stain'd this napkin with the blood\n"+
		"That valiant Clifford, with his rapier's point,\n"+
		"Made issue from the bosom of the boy;\n"+
		"And if thine eyes can water for his death,\n"+
		"I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal.\n"+
		"Alas poor York! but that I hate thee deadly,\n"+
		"I should lament thy miserable state.\n"+
		"I prithee, grieve, to make me merry, York.\n"+
		"What, hath thy fiery heart so parch'd thine entrails\n"+
		"That not a tear can fall for Rutland's death?\n"+
		"Why art thou patient, man? thou shouldst be mad;\n"+
		"And I, to make thee mad, do mock thee thus.\n"+
		"Stamp, rave, and fret, that I may sing and dance.\n"+
		"Thou wouldst be fee'd, I see, to make me sport:\n"+
		"York cannot speak, unless he wear a crown.\n"+
		"A crown for York! and, lords, bow low to him:\n"+
		"Hold you his hands, whilst I do set it on.\n"+
		"Putting a paper crown on his head\n"+
		"Ay, marry, sir, now looks he like a king!\n"+
		"Ay, this is he that took King Henry's chair,\n"+
		"And this is he was his adopted heir.\n"+
		"But how is it that great Plantagenet\n"+
		"Is crown'd so soon, and broke his solemn oath?\n"+
		"As I bethink me, you should not be king\n"+
		"Till our King Henry had shook hands with death.\n"+
		"And will you pale your head in Henry's glory,\n"+
		"And rob his temples of the diadem,\n"+
		"Now in his life, against your holy oath?\n"+
		"O, 'tis a fault too too unpardonable!\n"+
		"Off with the crown, and with the crown his head;\n"+
		"And, whilst we breathe, take time to do him dead.\n"+
		"CLIFFORD\n"+
		"That is my office, for my father's sake.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Nay, stay; lets hear the orisons he makes.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"She-wolf of France, but worse than wolves of France,\n"+
		"Whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth!\n"+
		"How ill-beseeming is it in thy sex\n"+
		"To triumph, like an Amazonian trull,\n"+
		"Upon their woes whom fortune captivates!\n"+
		"But that thy face is, vizard-like, unchanging,\n"+
		"Made impudent with use of evil deeds,\n"+
		"I would assay, proud queen, to make thee blush.\n"+
		"To tell thee whence thou camest, of whom derived,\n"+
		"Were shame enough to shame thee, wert thou not shameless.\n"+
		"Thy father bears the type of King of Naples,\n"+
		"Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem,\n"+
		"Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman.\n"+
		"Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult?\n"+
		"It needs not, nor it boots thee not, proud queen,\n"+
		"Unless the adage must be verified,\n"+
		"That beggars mounted run their horse to death.\n"+
		"'Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud;\n"+
		"But, God he knows, thy share thereof is small:\n"+
		"'Tis virtue that doth make them most admired;\n"+
		"The contrary doth make thee wonder'd at:\n"+
		"'Tis government that makes them seem divine;\n"+
		"The want thereof makes thee abominable:\n"+
		"Thou art as opposite to every good\n"+
		"As the Antipodes are unto us,\n"+
		"Or as the south to the septentrion.\n"+
		"O tiger's heart wrapt in a woman's hide!\n"+
		"How couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child,\n"+
		"To bid the father wipe his eyes withal,\n"+
		"And yet be seen to bear a woman's face?\n"+
		"Women are soft, mild, pitiful and flexible;\n"+
		"Thou stern, obdurate, flinty, rough, remorseless.\n"+
		"Bids't thou me rage? why, now thou hast thy wish:\n"+
		"Wouldst have me weep? why, now thou hast thy will:\n"+
		"For raging wind blows up incessant showers,\n"+
		"And when the rage allays, the rain begins.\n"+
		"These tears are my sweet Rutland's obsequies:\n"+
		"And every drop cries vengeance for his death,\n"+
		"'Gainst thee, fell Clifford, and thee, false\n"+
		"Frenchwoman.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"Beshrew me, but his passion moves me so\n"+
		"That hardly can I cheque my eyes from tears.\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"That face of his the hungry cannibals\n"+
		"Would not have touch'd, would not have stain'd with blood:\n"+
		"But you are more inhuman, more inexorable,\n"+
		"O, ten times more, than tigers of Hyrcania.\n"+
		"See, ruthless queen, a hapless father's tears:\n"+
		"This cloth thou dip'dst in blood of my sweet boy,\n"+
		"And I with tears do wash the blood away.\n"+
		"Keep thou the napkin, and go boast of this:\n"+
		"And if thou tell'st the heavy story right,\n"+
		"Upon my soul, the hearers will shed tears;\n"+
		"Yea even my foes will shed fast-falling tears,\n"+
		"And say 'Alas, it was a piteous deed!'\n"+
		"There, take the crown, and, with the crown, my curse;\n"+
		"And in thy need such comfort come to thee\n"+
		"As now I reap at thy too cruel hand!\n"+
		"Hard-hearted Clifford, take me from the world:\n"+
		"My soul to heaven, my blood upon your heads!\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"Had he been slaughter-man to all my kin,\n"+
		"I should not for my life but weep with him.\n"+
		"To see how inly sorrow gripes his soul.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"What, weeping-ripe, my Lord Northumberland?\n"+
		"Think but upon the wrong he did us all,\n"+
		"And that will quickly dry thy melting tears.\n"+
		"CLIFFORD\n"+
		"Here's for my oath, here's for my father's death.\n"+
		"Stabbing him\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"And here's to right our gentle-hearted king.\n"+
		"Stabbing him\n"+
		"YORK\n"+
		"Open Thy gate of mercy, gracious God!\n"+
		"My soul flies through these wounds to seek out Thee.\n"+
		"Dies\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Off with his head, and set it on York gates;\n"+
		"So York may overlook the town of York.\n"+
		"Flourish. Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT II\n"+
		"SCENE I. A plain near Mortimer's Cross in Herefordshire.\n"+
		"A march. Enter EDWARD, RICHARD, and their power\n"+
		"EDWARD\n"+
		"I wonder how our princely father 'scaped,\n"+
		"Or whether he be 'scaped away or no\n"+
		"From Clifford's and Northumberland's pursuit:\n"+
		"Had he been ta'en, we should have heard the news;\n"+
		"Had he been slain, we should have heard the news;\n"+
		"Or had he 'scaped, methinks we should have heard\n"+
		"The happy tidings of his good escape.\n"+
		"How fares my brother? why is he so sad?\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"I cannot joy, until I be resolved\n"+
		"Where our right valiant father is become.\n"+
		"I saw him in the battle range about;\n"+
		"And watch'd him how he singled Clifford forth.\n"+
		"Methought he bore him in the thickest troop\n"+
		"As doth a lion in a herd of neat;\n"+
		"Or as a bear, encompass'd round with dogs,\n"+
		"Who having pinch'd a few and made them cry,\n"+
		"The rest stand all aloof, and bark at him.\n"+
		"So fared our father with his enemies;\n"+
		"So fled his enemies my warlike father:\n"+
		"Methinks, 'tis prize enough to be his son.\n"+
		"See how the morning opes her golden gates,\n"+
		"And takes her farewell of the glorious sun!\n"+
		"How well resembles it the prime of youth,\n"+
		"Trimm'd like a younker prancing to his love!\n"+
		"EDWARD\n"+
		"Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"Three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun;\n"+
		"Not separated with the racking clouds,\n"+
		"But sever'd in a pale clear-shining sky.\n"+
		"See, see! they join, embrace, and seem to kiss,\n"+
		"As if they vow'd some league inviolable:\n"+
		"Now are they but one lamp, one light, one sun.\n"+
		"In this the heaven figures some event.\n"+
		"EDWARD\n"+
		"'Tis wondrous strange, the like yet never heard of.\n"+
		"I think it cites us, brother, to the field,\n"+
		"That we, the sons of brave Plantagenet,\n"+
		"Each one already blazing by our meeds,\n"+
		"Should notwithstanding join our lights together\n"+
		"And over-shine the earth as this the world.\n"+
		"Whate'er it bodes, henceforward will I bear\n"+
		"Upon my target three fair-shining suns.\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"Nay, bear three daughters: by your leave I speak it,\n"+
		"You love the breeder better than the male.\n"+
		"Enter a Messenger\n"+
		"But what art thou, whose heavy looks foretell\n"+
		"Some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Ah, one that was a woful looker-on\n"+
		"When as the noble Duke of York was slain,\n"+
		"Your princely father and my loving lord!\n"+
		"EDWARD\n"+
		"O, speak no more, for I have heard too much.\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"Say how he died, for I will hear it all.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Environed he was with many foes,\n"+
		"And stood against them, as the hope of Troy\n"+
		"Against the Greeks that would have enter'd Troy.\n"+
		"But Hercules himself must yield to odds;\n"+
		"And many strokes, though with a little axe,\n"+
		"Hew down and fell the hardest-timber'd oak.\n"+
		"By many hands your father was subdued;\n"+
		"But only slaughter'd by the ireful arm\n"+
		"Of unrelenting Clifford and the queen,\n"+
		"Who crown'd the gracious duke in high despite,\n"+
		"Laugh'd in his face; and when with grief he wept,\n"+
		"The ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks\n"+
		"A napkin steeped in the harmless blood\n"+
		"Of sweet young Rutland, by rough Clifford slain:\n"+
		"And after many scorns, many foul taunts,\n"+
		"They took his head, and on the gates of York\n"+
		"They set the same; and there it doth remain,\n"+
		"The saddest spectacle that e'er I view'd.\n"+
		"EDWARD\n"+
		"Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon,\n"+
		"Now thou art gone, we have no staff, no stay.\n"+
		"O Clifford, boisterous Clifford! thou hast slain\n"+
		"The flower of Europe for his chivalry;\n"+
		"And treacherously hast thou vanquish'd him,\n"+
		"For hand to hand he would have vanquish'd thee.\n"+
		"Now my soul's palace is become a prison:\n"+
		"Ah, would she break from hence, that this my body\n"+
		"Might in the ground be closed up in rest!\n"+
		"For never henceforth shall I joy again,\n"+
		"Never, O never shall I see more joy!\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"I cannot weep; for all my body's moisture\n"+
		"Scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart:\n"+
		"Nor can my tongue unload my heart's great burthen;\n"+
		"For selfsame wind that I should speak withal\n"+
		"Is kindling coals that fires all my breast,\n"+
		"And burns me up with flames that tears would quench.\n"+
		"To weep is to make less the depth of grief:\n"+
		"Tears then for babes; blows and revenge for me\n"+
		"Richard, I bear thy name; I'll venge thy death,\n"+
		"Or die renowned by attempting it.\n"+
		"EDWARD\n"+
		"His name that valiant duke hath left with thee;\n"+
		"His dukedom and his chair with me is left.\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"Nay, if thou be that princely eagle's bird,\n"+
		"Show thy descent by gazing 'gainst the sun:\n"+
		"For chair and dukedom, throne and kingdom say;\n"+
		"Either that is thine, or else thou wert not his.\n"+
		"March. Enter WARWICK, MONTAGUE, and their army\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"How now, fair lords! What fare? what news abroad?\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"Great Lord of Warwick, if we should recount\n"+
		"Our baleful news, and at each word's deliverance\n"+
		"Stab poniards in our flesh till all were told,\n"+
		"The words would add more anguish than the wounds.\n"+
		"O valiant lord, the Duke of York is slain!\n"+
		"EDWARD\n"+
		"O Warwick, Warwick! that Plantagenet,\n"+
		"Which held three dearly as his soul's redemption,\n"+
		"Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Ten days ago I drown'd these news in tears;\n"+
		"And now, to add more measure to your woes,\n"+
		"I come to tell you things sith then befall'n.\n"+
		"After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought,\n"+
		"Where your brave father breathed his latest gasp,\n"+
		"Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run,\n"+
		"Were brought me of your loss and his depart.\n"+
		"I, then in London keeper of the king,\n"+
		"Muster'd my soldiers, gather'd flocks of friends,\n"+
		"And very well appointed, as I thought,\n"+
		"March'd toward Saint Alban's to intercept the queen,\n"+
		"Bearing the king in my behalf along;\n"+
		"For by my scouts I was advertised\n"+
		"That she was coming with a full intent\n"+
		"To dash our late decree in parliament\n"+
		"Touching King Henry's oath and your succession.\n"+
		"Short tale to make, we at Saint Alban's met\n"+
		"Our battles join'd, and both sides fiercely fought:\n"+
		"But whether 'twas the coldness of the king,\n"+
		"Who look'd full gently on his warlike queen,\n"+
		"That robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen;\n"+
		"Or whether 'twas report of her success;\n"+
		"Or more than common fear of Clifford's rigour,\n"+
		"Who thunders to his captives blood and death,\n"+
		"I cannot judge: but to conclude with truth,\n"+
		"Their weapons like to lightning came and went;\n"+
		"Our soldiers', like the night-owl's lazy flight,\n"+
		"Or like an idle thresher with a flail,\n"+
		"Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends.\n"+
		"I cheer'd them up with justice of our cause,\n"+
		"With promise of high pay and great rewards:\n"+
		"But all in vain; they had no heart to fight,\n"+
		"And we in them no hope to win the day;\n"+
		"So that we fled; the king unto the queen;\n"+
		"Lord George your brother, Norfolk and myself,\n"+
		"In haste, post-haste, are come to join with you:\n"+
		"For in the marches here we heard you were,\n"+
		"Making another head to fight again.\n"+
		"EDWARD\n"+
		"Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick?\n"+
		"And when came George from Burgundy to England?\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers;\n"+
		"And for your brother, he was lately sent\n"+
		"From your kind aunt, Duchess of Burgundy,\n"+
		"With aid of soldiers to this needful war.\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"'Twas odds, belike, when valiant Warwick fled:\n"+
		"Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit,\n"+
		"But ne'er till now his scandal of retire.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear;\n"+
		"For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine\n"+
		"Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry's head,\n"+
		"And wring the awful sceptre from his fist,\n"+
		"Were he as famous and as bold in war\n"+
		"As he is famed for mildness, peace, and prayer.\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"I know it well, Lord Warwick; blame me not:\n"+
		"'Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak.\n"+
		"But in this troublous time what's to be done?\n"+
		"Shall we go throw away our coats of steel,\n"+
		"And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns,\n"+
		"Numbering our Ave-Maries with our beads?\n"+
		"Or shall we on the helmets of our foes\n"+
		"Tell our devotion with revengeful arms?\n"+
		"If for the last, say ay, and to it, lords.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;\n"+
		"And therefore comes my brother Montague.\n"+
		"Attend me, lords. The proud insulting queen,\n"+
		"With Clifford and the haught Northumberland,\n"+
		"And of their feather many more proud birds,\n"+
		"Have wrought the easy-melting king like wax.\n"+
		"He swore consent to your succession,\n"+
		"His oath enrolled in the parliament;\n"+
		"And now to London all the crew are gone,\n"+
		"To frustrate both his oath and what beside\n"+
		"May make against the house of Lancaster.\n"+
		"Their power, I think, is thirty thousand strong:\n"+
		"Now, if the help of Norfolk and myself,\n"+
		"With all the friends that thou, brave Earl of March,\n"+
		"Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure,\n"+
		"Will but amount to five and twenty thousand,\n"+
		"Why, Via! to London will we march amain,\n"+
		"And once again bestride our foaming steeds,\n"+
		"And once again cry 'Charge upon our foes!'\n"+
		"But never once again turn back and fly.\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak:\n"+
		"Ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day,\n"+
		"That cries 'Retire,' if Warwick bid him stay.\n"+
		"EDWARD\n"+
		"Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean;\n"+
		"And when thou fail'st--as God forbid the hour!--\n"+
		"Must Edward fall, which peril heaven forfend!\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York:\n"+
		"The next degree is England's royal throne;\n"+
		"For King of England shalt thou be proclaim'd\n"+
		"In every borough as we pass along;\n"+
		"And he that throws not up his cap for joy\n"+
		"Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head.\n"+
		"King Edward, valiant Richard, Montague,\n"+
		"Stay we no longer, dreaming of renown,\n"+
		"But sound the trumpets, and about our task.\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"Then, Clifford, were thy heart as hard as steel,\n"+
		"As thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds,\n"+
		"I come to pierce it, or to give thee mine.\n"+
		"EDWARD\n"+
		"Then strike up drums: God and Saint George for us!\n"+
		"Enter a Messenger\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"How now! what news?\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"The Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me,\n"+
		"The queen is coming with a puissant host;\n"+
		"And craves your company for speedy counsel.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Why then it sorts, brave warriors, let's away.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. Before York.\n"+
		"Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN MARGARET, PRINCE EDWARD, CLIFFORD, and NORTHUMBERLAND, with drum and trumpets\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Welcome, my lord, to this brave town of York.\n"+
		"Yonder's the head of that arch-enemy\n"+
		"That sought to be encompass'd with your crown:\n"+
		"Doth not the object cheer your heart, my lord?\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck:\n"+
		"To see this sight, it irks my very soul.\n"+
		"Withhold revenge, dear God! 'tis not my fault,\n"+
		"Nor wittingly have I infringed my vow.\n"+
		"CLIFFORD\n"+
		"My gracious liege, this too much lenity\n"+
		"And harmful pity must be laid aside.\n"+
		"To whom do lions cast their gentle looks?\n"+
		"Not to the beast that would usurp their den.\n"+
		"Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick?\n"+
		"Not his that spoils her young before her face.\n"+
		"Who 'scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting?\n"+
		"Not he that sets his foot upon her back.\n"+
		"The smallest worm will turn being trodden on,\n"+
		"And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood.\n"+
		"Ambitious York doth level at thy crown,\n"+
		"Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows:\n"+
		"He, but a duke, would have his son a king,\n"+
		"And raise his issue, like a loving sire;\n"+
		"Thou, being a king, blest with a goodly son,\n"+
		"Didst yield consent to disinherit him,\n"+
		"Which argued thee a most unloving father.\n"+
		"Unreasonable creatures feed their young;\n"+
		"And though man's face be fearful to their eyes,\n"+
		"Yet, in protection of their tender ones,\n"+
		"Who hath not seen them, even with those wings\n"+
		"Which sometime they have used with fearful flight,\n"+
		"Make war with him that climb'd unto their nest,\n"+
		"Offer their own lives in their young's defence?\n"+
		"For shame, my liege, make them your precedent!\n"+
		"Were it not pity that this goodly boy\n"+
		"Should lose his birthright by his father's fault,\n"+
		"And long hereafter say unto his child,\n"+
		"'What my great-grandfather and his grandsire got\n"+
		"My careless father fondly gave away'?\n"+
		"Ah, what a shame were this! Look on the boy;\n"+
		"And let his manly face, which promiseth\n"+
		"Successful fortune, steel thy melting heart\n"+
		"To hold thine own and leave thine own with him.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Full well hath Clifford play'd the orator,\n"+
		"Inferring arguments of mighty force.\n"+
		"But, Clifford, tell me, didst thou never hear\n"+
		"That things ill-got had ever bad success?\n"+
		"And happy always was it for that son\n"+
		"Whose father for his hoarding went to hell?\n"+
		"I'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind;\n"+
		"And would my father had left me no more!\n"+
		"For all the rest is held at such a rate\n"+
		"As brings a thousand-fold more care to keep\n"+
		"Than in possession and jot of pleasure.\n"+
		"Ah, cousin York! would thy best friends did know\n"+
		"How it doth grieve me that thy head is here!\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"My lord, cheer up your spirits: our foes are nigh,\n"+
		"And this soft courage makes your followers faint.\n"+
		"You promised knighthood to our forward son:\n"+
		"Unsheathe your sword, and dub him presently.\n"+
		"Edward, kneel down.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight;\n"+
		"And learn this lesson, draw thy sword in right.\n"+
		"PRINCE\n"+
		"My gracious father, by your kingly leave,\n"+
		"I'll draw it as apparent to the crown,\n"+
		"And in that quarrel use it to the death.\n"+
		"CLIFFORD\n"+
		"Why, that is spoken like a toward prince.\n"+
		"Enter a Messenger\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Royal commanders, be in readiness:\n"+
		"For with a band of thirty thousand men\n"+
		"Comes Warwick, backing of the Duke of York;\n"+
		"And in the towns, as they do march along,\n"+
		"Proclaims him king, and many fly to him:\n"+
		"Darraign your battle, for they are at hand.\n"+
		"CLIFFORD\n"+
		"I would your highness would depart the field:\n"+
		"The queen hath best success when you are absent.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Ay, good my lord, and leave us to our fortune.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Why, that's my fortune too; therefore I'll stay.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"Be it with resolution then to fight.\n"+
		"PRINCE EDWARD\n"+
		"My royal father, cheer these noble lords\n"+
		"And hearten those that fight in your defence:\n"+
		"Unsheathe your sword, good father; cry 'Saint George!'\n"+
		"March. Enter EDWARD, GEORGE, RICHARD, WARWICK, NORFOLK, MONTAGUE, and Soldiers\n"+
		"EDWARD\n"+
		"Now, perjured Henry! wilt thou kneel for grace,\n"+
		"And set thy diadem upon my head;\n"+
		"Or bide the mortal fortune of the field?\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Go, rate thy minions, proud insulting boy!\n"+
		"Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms\n"+
		"Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king?\n"+
		"EDWARD\n"+
		"I am his king, and he should bow his knee;\n"+
		"I was adopted heir by his consent:\n"+
		"Since when, his oath is broke; for, as I hear,\n"+
		"You, that are king, though he do wear the crown,\n"+
		"Have caused him, by new act of parliament,\n"+
		"To blot out me, and put his own son in.\n"+
		"CLIFFORD\n"+
		"And reason too:\n"+
		"Who should succeed the father but the son?\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"Are you there, butcher? O, I cannot speak!\n"+
		"CLIFFORD\n"+
		"Ay, crook-back, here I stand to answer thee,\n"+
		"Or any he the proudest of thy sort.\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"'Twas you that kill'd young Rutland, was it not?\n"+
		"CLIFFORD\n"+
		"Ay, and old York, and yet not satisfied.\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"For God's sake, lords, give signal to the fight.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"What say'st thou, Henry, wilt thou yield the crown?\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Why, how now, long-tongued Warwick! dare you speak?\n"+
		"When you and I met at Saint Alban's last,\n"+
		"Your legs did better service than your hands.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Then 'twas my turn to fly, and now 'tis thine.\n"+
		"CLIFFORD\n"+
		"You said so much before, and yet you fled.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"'Twas not your valour, Clifford, drove me thence.\n"+
		"NORTHUMBERLAND\n"+
		"No, nor your manhood that durst make you stay.\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"Northumberland, I hold thee reverently.\n"+
		"Break off the parley; for scarce I can refrain\n"+
		"The execution of my big-swoln heart\n"+
		"Upon that Clifford, that cruel child-killer.\n"+
		"CLIFFORD\n"+
		"I slew thy father, call'st thou him a child?\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"Ay, like a dastard and a treacherous coward,\n"+
		"As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland;\n"+
		"But ere sunset I'll make thee curse the deed.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Have done with words, my lords, and hear me speak.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Defy them then, or else hold close thy lips.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"I prithee, give no limits to my tongue:\n"+
		"I am a king, and privileged to speak.\n"+
		"CLIFFORD\n"+
		"My liege, the wound that bred this meeting here\n"+
		"Cannot be cured by words; therefore be still.\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"Then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword:\n"+
		"By him that made us all, I am resolved\n"+
		"that Clifford's manhood lies upon his tongue.\n"+
		"EDWARD\n"+
		"Say, Henry, shall I have my right, or no?\n"+
		"A thousand men have broke their fasts to-day,\n"+
		"That ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"If thou deny, their blood upon thy head;\n"+
		"For York in justice puts his armour on.\n"+
		"PRINCE EDWARD\n"+
		"If that be right which Warwick says is right,\n"+
		"There is no wrong, but every thing is right.\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"Whoever got thee, there thy mother stands;\n"+
		"For, well I wot, thou hast thy mother's tongue.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam;\n"+
		"But like a foul mis-shapen stigmatic,\n"+
		"Mark'd by the destinies to be avoided,\n"+
		"As venom toads, or lizards' dreadful stings.\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"Iron of Naples hid with English gilt,\n"+
		"Whose father bears the title of a king,--\n"+
		"As if a channel should be call'd the sea,--\n"+
		"Shamest thou not, knowing whence thou art extraught,\n"+
		"To let thy tongue detect thy base-born heart?\n"+
		"EDWARD\n"+
		"A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns,\n"+
		"To make this shameless callet know herself.\n"+
		"Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou,\n"+
		"Although thy husband may be Menelaus;\n"+
		"And ne'er was Agamemnon's brother wrong'd\n"+
		"By that false woman, as this king by thee.\n"+
		"His father revell'd in the heart of France,\n"+
		"And tamed the king, and made the dauphin stoop;\n"+
		"And had he match'd according to his state,\n"+
		"He might have kept that glory to this day;\n"+
		"But when he took a beggar to his bed,\n"+
		"And graced thy poor sire with his bridal-day,\n"+
		"Even then that sunshine brew'd a shower for him,\n"+
		"That wash'd his father's fortunes forth of France,\n"+
		"And heap'd sedition on his crown at home.\n"+
		"For what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride?\n"+
		"Hadst thou been meek, our title still had slept;\n"+
		"And we, in pity of the gentle king,\n"+
		"Had slipp'd our claim until another age.\n"+
		"GEORGE\n"+
		"But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring,\n"+
		"And that thy summer bred us no increase,\n"+
		"We set the axe to thy usurping root;\n"+
		"And though the edge hath something hit ourselves,\n"+
		"Yet, know thou, since we have begun to strike,\n"+
		"We'll never leave till we have hewn thee down,\n"+
		"Or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods.\n"+
		"EDWARD\n"+
		"And, in this resolution, I defy thee;\n"+
		"Not willing any longer conference,\n"+
		"Since thou deniest the gentle king to speak.\n"+
		"Sound trumpets! let our bloody colours wave!\n"+
		"And either victory, or else a grave.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Stay, Edward.\n"+
		"EDWARD\n"+
		"No, wrangling woman, we'll no longer stay:\n"+
		"These words will cost ten thousand lives this day.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. A field of battle between Towton and Saxton, in\n"+
		"Yorkshire.\n"+
		"Alarum. Excursions. Enter WARWICK\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Forspent with toil, as runners with a race,\n"+
		"I lay me down a little while to breathe;\n"+
		"For strokes received, and many blows repaid,\n"+
		"Have robb'd my strong-knit sinews of their strength,\n"+
		"And spite of spite needs must I rest awhile.\n"+
		"Enter EDWARD, running\n"+
		"EDWARD\n"+
		"Smile, gentle heaven! or strike, ungentle death!\n"+
		"For this world frowns, and Edward's sun is clouded.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"How now, my lord! what hap? what hope of good?\n"+
		"Enter GEORGE\n"+
		"GEORGE\n"+
		"Our hap is loss, our hope but sad despair;\n"+
		"Our ranks are broke, and ruin follows us:\n"+
		"What counsel give you? whither shall we fly?\n"+
		"EDWARD\n"+
		"Bootless is flight, they follow us with wings;\n"+
		"And weak we are and cannot shun pursuit.\n"+
		"Enter RICHARD\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"Ah, Warwick, why hast thou withdrawn thyself?\n"+
		"Thy brother's blood the thirsty earth hath drunk,\n"+
		"Broach'd with the steely point of Clifford's lance;\n"+
		"And in the very pangs of death he cried,\n"+
		"Like to a dismal clangour heard from far,\n"+
		"'Warwick, revenge! brother, revenge my death!'\n"+
		"So, underneath the belly of their steeds,\n"+
		"That stain'd their fetlocks in his smoking blood,\n"+
		"The noble gentleman gave up the ghost.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Then let the earth be drunken with our blood:\n"+
		"I'll kill my horse, because I will not fly.\n"+
		"Why stand we like soft-hearted women here,\n"+
		"Wailing our losses, whiles the foe doth rage;\n"+
		"And look upon, as if the tragedy\n"+
		"Were play'd in jest by counterfeiting actors?\n"+
		"Here on my knee I vow to God above,\n"+
		"I'll never pause again, never stand still,\n"+
		"Till either death hath closed these eyes of mine\n"+
		"Or fortune given me measure of revenge.\n"+
		"EDWARD\n"+
		"O Warwick, I do bend my knee with thine;\n"+
		"And in this vow do chain my soul to thine!\n"+
		"And, ere my knee rise from the earth's cold face,\n"+
		"I throw my hands, mine eyes, my heart to thee,\n"+
		"Thou setter up and plucker down of kings,\n"+
		"Beseeching thee, if with they will it stands\n"+
		"That to my foes this body must be prey,\n"+
		"Yet that thy brazen gates of heaven may ope,\n"+
		"And give sweet passage to my sinful soul!\n"+
		"Now, lords, take leave until we meet again,\n"+
		"Where'er it be, in heaven or in earth.\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"Brother, give me thy hand; and, gentle Warwick,\n"+
		"Let me embrace thee in my weary arms:\n"+
		"I, that did never weep, now melt with woe\n"+
		"That winter should cut off our spring-time so.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Away, away! Once more, sweet lords farewell.\n"+
		"GEORGE\n"+
		"Yet let us all together to our troops,\n"+
		"And give them leave to fly that will not stay;\n"+
		"And call them pillars that will stand to us;\n"+
		"And, if we thrive, promise them such rewards\n"+
		"As victors wear at the Olympian games:\n"+
		"This may plant courage in their quailing breasts;\n"+
		"For yet is hope of life and victory.\n"+
		"Forslow no longer, make we hence amain.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV. Another part of the field.\n"+
		"Excursions. Enter RICHARD and CLIFFORD\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"Now, Clifford, I have singled thee alone:\n"+
		"Suppose this arm is for the Duke of York,\n"+
		"And this for Rutland; both bound to revenge,\n"+
		"Wert thou environ'd with a brazen wall.\n"+
		"CLIFFORD\n"+
		"Now, Richard, I am with thee here alone:\n"+
		"This is the hand that stabb'd thy father York;\n"+
		"And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland;\n"+
		"And here's the heart that triumphs in their death\n"+
		"And cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother\n"+
		"To execute the like upon thyself;\n"+
		"And so, have at thee!\n"+
		"They fight. WARWICK comes; CLIFFORD flies\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"Nay Warwick, single out some other chase;\n"+
		"For I myself will hunt this wolf to death.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE V. Another part of the field.\n"+
		"Alarum. Enter KING HENRY VI alone\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"This battle fares like to the morning's war,\n"+
		"When dying clouds contend with growing light,\n"+
		"What time the shepherd, blowing of his nails,\n"+
		"Can neither call it perfect day nor night.\n"+
		"Now sways it this way, like a mighty sea\n"+
		"Forced by the tide to combat with the wind;\n"+
		"Now sways it that way, like the selfsame sea\n"+
		"Forced to retire by fury of the wind:\n"+
		"Sometime the flood prevails, and then the wind;\n"+
		"Now one the better, then another best;\n"+
		"Both tugging to be victors, breast to breast,\n"+
		"Yet neither conqueror nor conquered:\n"+
		"So is the equal of this fell war.\n"+
		"Here on this molehill will I sit me down.\n"+
		"To whom God will, there be the victory!\n"+
		"For Margaret my queen, and Clifford too,\n"+
		"Have chid me from the battle; swearing both\n"+
		"They prosper best of all when I am thence.\n"+
		"Would I were dead! if God's good will were so;\n"+
		"For what is in this world but grief and woe?\n"+
		"O God! methinks it were a happy life,\n"+
		"To be no better than a homely swain;\n"+
		"To sit upon a hill, as I do now,\n"+
		"To carve out dials quaintly, point by point,\n"+
		"Thereby to see the minutes how they run,\n"+
		"How many make the hour full complete;\n"+
		"How many hours bring about the day;\n"+
		"How many days will finish up the year;\n"+
		"How many years a mortal man may live.\n"+
		"When this is known, then to divide the times:\n"+
		"So many hours must I tend my flock;\n"+
		"So many hours must I take my rest;\n"+
		"So many hours must I contemplate;\n"+
		"So many hours must I sport myself;\n"+
		"So many days my ewes have been with young;\n"+
		"So many weeks ere the poor fools will ean:\n"+
		"So many years ere I shall shear the fleece:\n"+
		"So minutes, hours, days, months, and years,\n"+
		"Pass'd over to the end they were created,\n"+
		"Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave.\n"+
		"Ah, what a life were this! how sweet! how lovely!\n"+
		"Gives not the hawthorn-bush a sweeter shade\n"+
		"To shepherds looking on their silly sheep,\n"+
		"Than doth a rich embroider'd canopy\n"+
		"To kings that fear their subjects' treachery?\n"+
		"O, yes, it doth; a thousand-fold it doth.\n"+
		"And to conclude, the shepherd's homely curds,\n"+
		"His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle.\n"+
		"His wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade,\n"+
		"All which secure and sweetly he enjoys,\n"+
		"Is far beyond a prince's delicates,\n"+
		"His viands sparkling in a golden cup,\n"+
		"His body couched in a curious bed,\n"+
		"When care, mistrust, and treason waits on him.\n"+
		"Alarum. Enter a Son that has killed his father, dragging in the dead body\n"+
		"Son\n"+
		"Ill blows the wind that profits nobody.\n"+
		"This man, whom hand to hand I slew in fight,\n"+
		"May be possessed with some store of crowns;\n"+
		"And I, that haply take them from him now,\n"+
		"May yet ere night yield both my life and them\n"+
		"To some man else, as this dead man doth me.\n"+
		"Who's this? O God! it is my father's face,\n"+
		"Whom in this conflict I unwares have kill'd.\n"+
		"O heavy times, begetting such events!\n"+
		"From London by the king was I press'd forth;\n"+
		"My father, being the Earl of Warwick's man,\n"+
		"Came on the part of York, press'd by his master;\n"+
		"And I, who at his hands received my life, him\n"+
		"Have by my hands of life bereaved him.\n"+
		"Pardon me, God, I knew not what I did!\n"+
		"And pardon, father, for I knew not thee!\n"+
		"My tears shall wipe away these bloody marks;\n"+
		"And no more words till they have flow'd their fill.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"O piteous spectacle! O bloody times!\n"+
		"Whiles lions war and battle for their dens,\n"+
		"Poor harmless lambs abide their enmity.\n"+
		"Weep, wretched man, I'll aid thee tear for tear;\n"+
		"And let our hearts and eyes, like civil war,\n"+
		"Be blind with tears, and break o'ercharged with grief.\n"+
		"Enter a Father that has killed his son, bringing in the body\n"+
		"Father\n"+
		"Thou that so stoutly hast resisted me,\n"+
		"Give me thy gold, if thou hast any gold:\n"+
		"For I have bought it with an hundred blows.\n"+
		"But let me see: is this our foeman's face?\n"+
		"Ah, no, no, no, it is mine only son!\n"+
		"Ah, boy, if any life be left in thee,\n"+
		"Throw up thine eye! see, see what showers arise,\n"+
		"Blown with the windy tempest of my heart,\n"+
		"Upon thy words, that kill mine eye and heart!\n"+
		"O, pity, God, this miserable age!\n"+
		"What stratagems, how fell, how butcherly,\n"+
		"Erroneous, mutinous and unnatural,\n"+
		"This deadly quarrel daily doth beget!\n"+
		"O boy, thy father gave thee life too soon,\n"+
		"And hath bereft thee of thy life too late!\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Woe above woe! grief more than common grief!\n"+
		"O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds!\n"+
		"O pity, pity, gentle heaven, pity!\n"+
		"The red rose and the white are on his face,\n"+
		"The fatal colours of our striving houses:\n"+
		"The one his purple blood right well resembles;\n"+
		"The other his pale cheeks, methinks, presenteth:\n"+
		"Wither one rose, and let the other flourish;\n"+
		"If you contend, a thousand lives must wither.\n"+
		"Son\n"+
		"How will my mother for a father's death\n"+
		"Take on with me and ne'er be satisfied!\n"+
		"Father\n"+
		"How will my wife for slaughter of my son\n"+
		"Shed seas of tears and ne'er be satisfied!\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"How will the country for these woful chances\n"+
		"Misthink the king and not be satisfied!\n"+
		"Son\n"+
		"Was ever son so rued a father's death?\n"+
		"Father\n"+
		"Was ever father so bemoan'd his son?\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Was ever king so grieved for subjects' woe?\n"+
		"Much is your sorrow; mine ten times so much.\n"+
		"Son\n"+
		"I'll bear thee hence, where I may weep my fill.\n"+
		"Exit with the body\n"+
		"Father\n"+
		"These arms of mine shall be thy winding-sheet;\n"+
		"My heart, sweet boy, shall be thy sepulchre,\n"+
		"For from my heart thine image ne'er shall go;\n"+
		"My sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell;\n"+
		"And so obsequious will thy father be,\n"+
		"Even for the loss of thee, having no more,\n"+
		"As Priam was for all his valiant sons.\n"+
		"I'll bear thee hence; and let them fight that will,\n"+
		"For I have murdered where I should not kill.\n"+
		"Exit with the body\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Sad-hearted men, much overgone with care,\n"+
		"Here sits a king more woful than you are.\n"+
		"Alarums: excursions. Enter QUEEN MARGARET, PRINCE EDWARD, and EXETER\n"+
		"PRINCE EDWARD\n"+
		"Fly, father, fly! for all your friends are fled,\n"+
		"And Warwick rages like a chafed bull:\n"+
		"Away! for death doth hold us in pursuit.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Mount you, my lord; towards Berwick post amain:\n"+
		"Edward and Richard, like a brace of greyhounds\n"+
		"Having the fearful flying hare in sight,\n"+
		"With fiery eyes sparkling for very wrath,\n"+
		"And bloody steel grasp'd in their ireful hands,\n"+
		"Are at our backs; and therefore hence amain.\n"+
		"EXETER\n"+
		"Away! for vengeance comes along with them:\n"+
		"Nay, stay not to expostulate, make speed;\n"+
		"Or else come after: I'll away before.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Nay, take me with thee, good sweet Exeter:\n"+
		"Not that I fear to stay, but love to go\n"+
		"Whither the queen intends. Forward; away!\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE VI. Another part of the field.\n"+
		"A loud alarum. Enter CLIFFORD, wounded\n"+
		"CLIFFORD\n"+
		"Here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies,\n"+
		"Which, whiles it lasted, gave King Henry light.\n"+
		"O Lancaster, I fear thy overthrow\n"+
		"More than my body's parting with my soul!\n"+
		"My love and fear glued many friends to thee;\n"+
		"And, now I fall, thy tough commixture melts.\n"+
		"Impairing Henry, strengthening misproud York,\n"+
		"The common people swarm like summer flies;\n"+
		"And whither fly the gnats but to the sun?\n"+
		"And who shines now but Henry's enemies?\n"+
		"O Phoebus, hadst thou never given consent\n"+
		"That Phaethon should cheque thy fiery steeds,\n"+
		"Thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth!\n"+
		"And, Henry, hadst thou sway'd as kings should do,\n"+
		"Or as thy father and his father did,\n"+
		"Giving no ground unto the house of York,\n"+
		"They never then had sprung like summer flies;\n"+
		"I and ten thousand in this luckless realm\n"+
		"Had left no mourning widows for our death;\n"+
		"And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace.\n"+
		"For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air?\n"+
		"And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity?\n"+
		"Bootless are plaints, and cureless are my wounds;\n"+
		"No way to fly, nor strength to hold out flight:\n"+
		"The foe is merciless, and will not pity;\n"+
		"For at their hands I have deserved no pity.\n"+
		"The air hath got into my deadly wounds,\n"+
		"And much effuse of blood doth make me faint.\n"+
		"Come, York and Richard, Warwick and the rest;\n"+
		"I stabb'd your fathers' bosoms, split my breast.\n"+
		"He faints\n"+
		"Alarum and retreat. Enter EDWARD, GEORGE, RICHARD, MONTAGUE, WARWICK, and Soldiers\n"+
		"EDWARD\n"+
		"Now breathe we, lords: good fortune bids us pause,\n"+
		"And smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks.\n"+
		"Some troops pursue the bloody-minded queen,\n"+
		"That led calm Henry, though he were a king,\n"+
		"As doth a sail, fill'd with a fretting gust,\n"+
		"Command an argosy to stem the waves.\n"+
		"But think you, lords, that Clifford fled with them?\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"No, 'tis impossible he should escape,\n"+
		"For, though before his face I speak the words\n"+
		"Your brother Richard mark'd him for the grave:\n"+
		"And wheresoe'er he is, he's surely dead.\n"+
		"CLIFFORD groans, and dies\n"+
		"EDWARD\n"+
		"Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave?\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"A deadly groan, like life and death's departing.\n"+
		"EDWARD\n"+
		"See who it is: and, now the battle's ended,\n"+
		"If friend or foe, let him be gently used.\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"Revoke that doom of mercy, for 'tis Clifford;\n"+
		"Who not contented that he lopp'd the branch\n"+
		"In hewing Rutland when his leaves put forth,\n"+
		"But set his murdering knife unto the root\n"+
		"From whence that tender spray did sweetly spring,\n"+
		"I mean our princely father, Duke of York.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"From off the gates of York fetch down the head,\n"+
		"Your father's head, which Clifford placed there;\n"+
		"Instead whereof let this supply the room:\n"+
		"Measure for measure must be answered.\n"+
		"EDWARD\n"+
		"Bring forth that fatal screech-owl to our house,\n"+
		"That nothing sung but death to us and ours:\n"+
		"Now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound,\n"+
		"And his ill-boding tongue no more shall speak.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"I think his understanding is bereft.\n"+
		"Speak, Clifford, dost thou know who speaks to thee?\n"+
		"Dark cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life,\n"+
		"And he nor sees nor hears us what we say.\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"O, would he did! and so perhaps he doth:\n"+
		"'Tis but his policy to counterfeit,\n"+
		"Because he would avoid such bitter taunts\n"+
		"Which in the time of death he gave our father.\n"+
		"GEORGE\n"+
		"If so thou think'st, vex him with eager words.\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"Clifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace.\n"+
		"EDWARD\n"+
		"Clifford, repent in bootless penitence.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Clifford, devise excuses for thy faults.\n"+
		"GEORGE\n"+
		"While we devise fell tortures for thy faults.\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"Thou didst love York, and I am son to York.\n"+
		"EDWARD\n"+
		"Thou pitied'st Rutland; I will pity thee.\n"+
		"GEORGE\n"+
		"Where's Captain Margaret, to fence you now?\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"They mock thee, Clifford: swear as thou wast wont.\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"What, not an oath? nay, then the world goes hard\n"+
		"When Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath.\n"+
		"I know by that he's dead; and, by my soul,\n"+
		"If this right hand would buy two hour's life,\n"+
		"That I in all despite might rail at him,\n"+
		"This hand should chop it off, and with the\n"+
		"issuing blood\n"+
		"Stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst\n"+
		"York and young Rutland could not satisfy.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Ay, but he's dead: off with the traitor's head,\n"+
		"And rear it in the place your father's stands.\n"+
		"And now to London with triumphant march,\n"+
		"There to be crowned England's royal king:\n"+
		"From whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France,\n"+
		"And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen:\n"+
		"So shalt thou sinew both these lands together;\n"+
		"And, having France thy friend, thou shalt not dread\n"+
		"The scatter'd foe that hopes to rise again;\n"+
		"For though they cannot greatly sting to hurt,\n"+
		"Yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears.\n"+
		"First will I see the coronation;\n"+
		"And then to Brittany I'll cross the sea,\n"+
		"To effect this marriage, so it please my lord.\n"+
		"EDWARD\n"+
		"Even as thou wilt, sweet Warwick, let it be;\n"+
		"For in thy shoulder do I build my seat,\n"+
		"And never will I undertake the thing\n"+
		"Wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting.\n"+
		"Richard, I will create thee Duke of Gloucester,\n"+
		"And George, of Clarence: Warwick, as ourself,\n"+
		"Shall do and undo as him pleaseth best.\n"+
		"RICHARD\n"+
		"Let me be Duke of Clarence, George of Gloucester;\n"+
		"For Gloucester's dukedom is too ominous.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Tut, that's a foolish observation:\n"+
		"Richard, be Duke of Gloucester. Now to London,\n"+
		"To see these honours in possession.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT III\n"+
		"SCENE I. A forest in the north of England.\n"+
		"Enter two Keepers, with cross-bows in their hands\n"+
		"First Keeper\n"+
		"Under this thick-grown brake we'll shroud ourselves;\n"+
		"For through this laund anon the deer will come;\n"+
		"And in this covert will we make our stand,\n"+
		"Culling the principal of all the deer.\n"+
		"Second Keeper\n"+
		"I'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot.\n"+
		"First Keeper\n"+
		"That cannot be; the noise of thy cross-bow\n"+
		"Will scare the herd, and so my shoot is lost.\n"+
		"Here stand we both, and aim we at the best:\n"+
		"And, for the time shall not seem tedious,\n"+
		"I'll tell thee what befell me on a day\n"+
		"In this self-place where now we mean to stand.\n"+
		"Second Keeper\n"+
		"Here comes a man; let's stay till he be past.\n"+
		"Enter KING HENRY VI, disguised, with a prayerbook\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"From Scotland am I stol'n, even of pure love,\n"+
		"To greet mine own land with my wishful sight.\n"+
		"No, Harry, Harry, 'tis no land of thine;\n"+
		"Thy place is fill'd, thy sceptre wrung from thee,\n"+
		"Thy balm wash'd off wherewith thou wast anointed:\n"+
		"No bending knee will call thee Caesar now,\n"+
		"No humble suitors press to speak for right,\n"+
		"No, not a man comes for redress of thee;\n"+
		"For how can I help them, and not myself?\n"+
		"First Keeper\n"+
		"Ay, here's a deer whose skin's a keeper's fee:\n"+
		"This is the quondam king; let's seize upon him.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Let me embrace thee, sour adversity,\n"+
		"For wise men say it is the wisest course.\n"+
		"Second Keeper\n"+
		"Why linger we? let us lay hands upon him.\n"+
		"First Keeper\n"+
		"Forbear awhile; we'll hear a little more.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"My queen and son are gone to France for aid;\n"+
		"And, as I hear, the great commanding Warwick\n"+
		"Is thither gone, to crave the French king's sister\n"+
		"To wife for Edward: if this news be true,\n"+
		"Poor queen and son, your labour is but lost;\n"+
		"For Warwick is a subtle orator,\n"+
		"And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words.\n"+
		"By this account then Margaret may win him;\n"+
		"For she's a woman to be pitied much:\n"+
		"Her sighs will make a battery in his breast;\n"+
		"Her tears will pierce into a marble heart;\n"+
		"The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn;\n"+
		"And Nero will be tainted with remorse,\n"+
		"To hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears.\n"+
		"Ay, but she's come to beg, Warwick to give;\n"+
		"She, on his left side, craving aid for Henry,\n"+
		"He, on his right, asking a wife for Edward.\n"+
		"She weeps, and says her Henry is deposed;\n"+
		"He smiles, and says his Edward is install'd;\n"+
		"That she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more;\n"+
		"Whiles Warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong,\n"+
		"Inferreth arguments of mighty strength,\n"+
		"And in conclusion wins the king from her,\n"+
		"With promise of his sister, and what else,\n"+
		"To strengthen and support King Edward's place.\n"+
		"O Margaret, thus 'twill be; and thou, poor soul,\n"+
		"Art then forsaken, as thou went'st forlorn!\n"+
		"Second Keeper\n"+
		"Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"More than I seem, and less than I was born to:\n"+
		"A man at least, for less I should not be;\n"+
		"And men may talk of kings, and why not I?\n"+
		"Second Keeper\n"+
		"Ay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Why, so I am, in mind; and that's enough.\n"+
		"Second Keeper\n"+
		"But, if thou be a king, where is thy crown?\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"My crown is in my heart, not on my head;\n"+
		"Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones,\n"+
		"Nor to be seen: my crown is called content:\n"+
		"A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.\n"+
		"Second Keeper\n"+
		"Well, if you be a king crown'd with content,\n"+
		"Your crown content and you must be contented\n"+
		"To go along with us; for as we think,\n"+
		"You are the king King Edward hath deposed;\n"+
		"And we his subjects sworn in all allegiance\n"+
		"Will apprehend you as his enemy.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"But did you never swear, and break an oath?\n"+
		"Second Keeper\n"+
		"No, never such an oath; nor will not now.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Where did you dwell when I was King of England?\n"+
		"Second Keeper\n"+
		"Here in this country, where we now remain.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"I was anointed king at nine months old;\n"+
		"My father and my grandfather were kings,\n"+
		"And you were sworn true subjects unto me:\n"+
		"And tell me, then, have you not broke your oaths?\n"+
		"First Keeper\n"+
		"No;\n"+
		"For we were subjects but while you were king.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Why, am I dead? do I not breathe a man?\n"+
		"Ah, simple men, you know not what you swear!\n"+
		"Look, as I blow this feather from my face,\n"+
		"And as the air blows it to me again,\n"+
		"Obeying with my wind when I do blow,\n"+
		"And yielding to another when it blows,\n"+
		"Commanded always by the greater gust;\n"+
		"Such is the lightness of you common men.\n"+
		"But do not break your oaths; for of that sin\n"+
		"My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty.\n"+
		"Go where you will, the king shall be commanded;\n"+
		"And be you kings, command, and I'll obey.\n"+
		"First Keeper\n"+
		"We are true subjects to the king, King Edward.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"So would you be again to Henry,\n"+
		"If he were seated as King Edward is.\n"+
		"First Keeper\n"+
		"We charge you, in God's name, and the king's,\n"+
		"To go with us unto the officers.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"In God's name, lead; your king's name be obey'd:\n"+
		"And what God will, that let your king perform;\n"+
		"And what he will, I humbly yield unto.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. London. The palace.\n"+
		"Enter KING EDWARD IV, GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, and LADY GREY\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Brother of Gloucester, at Saint Alban's field\n"+
		"This lady's husband, Sir Richard Grey, was slain,\n"+
		"His lands then seized on by the conqueror:\n"+
		"Her suit is now to repossess those lands;\n"+
		"Which we in justice cannot well deny,\n"+
		"Because in quarrel of the house of York\n"+
		"The worthy gentleman did lose his life.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Your highness shall do well to grant her suit;\n"+
		"It were dishonour to deny it her.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"It were no less; but yet I'll make a pause.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"[Aside to CLARENCE] Yea, is it so?\n"+
		"I see the lady hath a thing to grant,\n"+
		"Before the king will grant her humble suit.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"[Aside to GLOUCESTER] He knows the game: how true\n"+
		"he keeps the wind!\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"[Aside to CLARENCE] Silence!\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Widow, we will consider of your suit;\n"+
		"And come some other time to know our mind.\n"+
		"LADY GREY\n"+
		"Right gracious lord, I cannot brook delay:\n"+
		"May it please your highness to resolve me now;\n"+
		"And what your pleasure is, shall satisfy me.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"[Aside to CLARENCE] Ay, widow? then I'll warrant\n"+
		"you all your lands,\n"+
		"An if what pleases him shall pleasure you.\n"+
		"Fight closer, or, good faith, you'll catch a blow.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"[Aside to GLOUCESTER] I fear her not, unless she\n"+
		"chance to fall.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"[Aside to CLARENCE] God forbid that! for he'll\n"+
		"take vantages.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"How many children hast thou, widow? tell me.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"[Aside to GLOUCESTER] I think he means to beg a\n"+
		"child of her.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"[Aside to CLARENCE] Nay, whip me then: he'll rather\n"+
		"give her two.\n"+
		"LADY GREY\n"+
		"Three, my most gracious lord.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"[Aside to CLARENCE] You shall have four, if you'll\n"+
		"be ruled by him.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"'Twere pity they should lose their father's lands.\n"+
		"LADY GREY\n"+
		"Be pitiful, dread lord, and grant it then.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Lords, give us leave: I'll try this widow's wit.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"[Aside to CLARENCE] Ay, good leave have you; for\n"+
		"you will have leave,\n"+
		"Till youth take leave and leave you to the crutch.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER and CLARENCE retire\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Now tell me, madam, do you love your children?\n"+
		"LADY GREY\n"+
		"Ay, full as dearly as I love myself.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"And would you not do much to do them good?\n"+
		"LADY GREY\n"+
		"To do them good, I would sustain some harm.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Then get your husband's lands, to do them good.\n"+
		"LADY GREY\n"+
		"Therefore I came unto your majesty.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"I'll tell you how these lands are to be got.\n"+
		"LADY GREY\n"+
		"So shall you bind me to your highness' service.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"What service wilt thou do me, if I give them?\n"+
		"LADY GREY\n"+
		"What you command, that rests in me to do.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"But you will take exceptions to my boon.\n"+
		"LADY GREY\n"+
		"No, gracious lord, except I cannot do it.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Ay, but thou canst do what I mean to ask.\n"+
		"LADY GREY\n"+
		"Why, then I will do what your grace commands.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"[Aside to CLARENCE] He plies her hard; and much rain\n"+
		"wears the marble.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"[Aside to GLOUCESTER] As red as fire! nay, then\n"+
		"her wax must melt.\n"+
		"LADY GREY\n"+
		"Why stops my lord, shall I not hear my task?\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"An easy task; 'tis but to love a king.\n"+
		"LADY GREY\n"+
		"That's soon perform'd, because I am a subject.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Why, then, thy husband's lands I freely give thee.\n"+
		"LADY GREY\n"+
		"I take my leave with many thousand thanks.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"[Aside to CLARENCE] The match is made; she seals it\n"+
		"with a curtsy.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"But stay thee, 'tis the fruits of love I mean.\n"+
		"LADY GREY\n"+
		"The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Ay, but, I fear me, in another sense.\n"+
		"What love, think'st thou, I sue so much to get?\n"+
		"LADY GREY\n"+
		"My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers;\n"+
		"That love which virtue begs and virtue grants.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"No, by my troth, I did not mean such love.\n"+
		"LADY GREY\n"+
		"Why, then you mean not as I thought you did.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"But now you partly may perceive my mind.\n"+
		"LADY GREY\n"+
		"My mind will never grant what I perceive\n"+
		"Your highness aims at, if I aim aright.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"To tell thee plain, I aim to lie with thee.\n"+
		"LADY GREY\n"+
		"To tell you plain, I had rather lie in prison.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Why, then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands.\n"+
		"LADY GREY\n"+
		"Why, then mine honesty shall be my dower;\n"+
		"For by that loss I will not purchase them.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily.\n"+
		"LADY GREY\n"+
		"Herein your highness wrongs both them and me.\n"+
		"But, mighty lord, this merry inclination\n"+
		"Accords not with the sadness of my suit:\n"+
		"Please you dismiss me either with 'ay' or 'no.'\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Ay, if thou wilt say 'ay' to my request;\n"+
		"No if thou dost say 'no' to my demand.\n"+
		"LADY GREY\n"+
		"Then, no, my lord. My suit is at an end.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"[Aside to CLARENCE] The widow likes him not, she\n"+
		"knits her brows.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"[Aside to GLOUCESTER] He is the bluntest wooer in\n"+
		"Christendom.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"[Aside] Her looks do argue her replete with modesty;\n"+
		"Her words do show her wit incomparable;\n"+
		"All her perfections challenge sovereignty:\n"+
		"One way or other, she is for a king;\n"+
		"And she shall be my love, or else my queen.--\n"+
		"Say that King Edward take thee for his queen?\n"+
		"LADY GREY\n"+
		"'Tis better said than done, my gracious lord:\n"+
		"I am a subject fit to jest withal,\n"+
		"But far unfit to be a sovereign.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Sweet widow, by my state I swear to thee\n"+
		"I speak no more than what my soul intends;\n"+
		"And that is, to enjoy thee for my love.\n"+
		"LADY GREY\n"+
		"And that is more than I will yield unto:\n"+
		"I know I am too mean to be your queen,\n"+
		"And yet too good to be your concubine.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"You cavil, widow: I did mean, my queen.\n"+
		"LADY GREY\n"+
		"'Twill grieve your grace my sons should call you father.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"No more than when my daughters call thee mother.\n"+
		"Thou art a widow, and thou hast some children;\n"+
		"And, by God's mother, I, being but a bachelor,\n"+
		"Have other some: why, 'tis a happy thing\n"+
		"To be the father unto many sons.\n"+
		"Answer no more, for thou shalt be my queen.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"[Aside to CLARENCE] The ghostly father now hath done\n"+
		"his shrift.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"[Aside to GLOUCESTER] When he was made a shriver,\n"+
		"'twas for shift.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Brothers, you muse what chat we two have had.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"The widow likes it not, for she looks very sad.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"You'll think it strange if I should marry her.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"To whom, my lord?\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Why, Clarence, to myself.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"That would be ten days' wonder at the least.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"That's a day longer than a wonder lasts.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"By so much is the wonder in extremes.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Well, jest on, brothers: I can tell you both\n"+
		"Her suit is granted for her husband's lands.\n"+
		"Enter a Nobleman\n"+
		"Nobleman\n"+
		"My gracious lord, Henry your foe is taken,\n"+
		"And brought your prisoner to your palace gate.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"See that he be convey'd unto the Tower:\n"+
		"And go we, brothers, to the man that took him,\n"+
		"To question of his apprehension.\n"+
		"Widow, go you along. Lords, use her honourably.\n"+
		"Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Ay, Edward will use women honourably.\n"+
		"Would he were wasted, marrow, bones and all,\n"+
		"That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring,\n"+
		"To cross me from the golden time I look for!\n"+
		"And yet, between my soul's desire and me--\n"+
		"The lustful Edward's title buried--\n"+
		"Is Clarence, Henry, and his son young Edward,\n"+
		"And all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies,\n"+
		"To take their rooms, ere I can place myself:\n"+
		"A cold premeditation for my purpose!\n"+
		"Why, then, I do but dream on sovereignty;\n"+
		"Like one that stands upon a promontory,\n"+
		"And spies a far-off shore where he would tread,\n"+
		"Wishing his foot were equal with his eye,\n"+
		"And chides the sea that sunders him from thence,\n"+
		"Saying, he'll lade it dry to have his way:\n"+
		"So do I wish the crown, being so far off;\n"+
		"And so I chide the means that keeps me from it;\n"+
		"And so I say, I'll cut the causes off,\n"+
		"Flattering me with impossibilities.\n"+
		"My eye's too quick, my heart o'erweens too much,\n"+
		"Unless my hand and strength could equal them.\n"+
		"Well, say there is no kingdom then for Richard;\n"+
		"What other pleasure can the world afford?\n"+
		"I'll make my heaven in a lady's lap,\n"+
		"And deck my body in gay ornaments,\n"+
		"And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks.\n"+
		"O miserable thought! and more unlikely\n"+
		"Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns!\n"+
		"Why, love forswore me in my mother's womb:\n"+
		"And, for I should not deal in her soft laws,\n"+
		"She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe,\n"+
		"To shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub;\n"+
		"To make an envious mountain on my back,\n"+
		"Where sits deformity to mock my body;\n"+
		"To shape my legs of an unequal size;\n"+
		"To disproportion me in every part,\n"+
		"Like to a chaos, or an unlick'd bear-whelp\n"+
		"That carries no impression like the dam.\n"+
		"And am I then a man to be beloved?\n"+
		"O monstrous fault, to harbour such a thought!\n"+
		"Then, since this earth affords no joy to me,\n"+
		"But to command, to cheque, to o'erbear such\n"+
		"As are of better person than myself,\n"+
		"I'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown,\n"+
		"And, whiles I live, to account this world but hell,\n"+
		"Until my mis-shaped trunk that bears this head\n"+
		"Be round impaled with a glorious crown.\n"+
		"And yet I know not how to get the crown,\n"+
		"For many lives stand between me and home:\n"+
		"And I,--like one lost in a thorny wood,\n"+
		"That rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns,\n"+
		"Seeking a way and straying from the way;\n"+
		"Not knowing how to find the open air,\n"+
		"But toiling desperately to find it out,--\n"+
		"Torment myself to catch the English crown:\n"+
		"And from that torment I will free myself,\n"+
		"Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.\n"+
		"Why, I can smile, and murder whiles I smile,\n"+
		"And cry 'Content' to that which grieves my heart,\n"+
		"And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,\n"+
		"And frame my face to all occasions.\n"+
		"I'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall;\n"+
		"I'll slay more gazers than the basilisk;\n"+
		"I'll play the orator as well as Nestor,\n"+
		"Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,\n"+
		"And, like a Sinon, take another Troy.\n"+
		"I can add colours to the chameleon,\n"+
		"Change shapes with Proteus for advantages,\n"+
		"And set the murderous Machiavel to school.\n"+
		"Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?\n"+
		"Tut, were it farther off, I'll pluck it down.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE III. France. KING LEWIS XI's palace.\n"+
		"Flourish. Enter KING LEWIS XI, his sister BONA, his Admiral, called BOURBON, PRINCE EDWARD, QUEEN MARGARET, and OXFORD. KING LEWIS XI sits, and riseth up again\n"+
		"KING LEWIS XI\n"+
		"Fair Queen of England, worthy Margaret,\n"+
		"Sit down with us: it ill befits thy state\n"+
		"And birth, that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"No, mighty King of France: now Margaret\n"+
		"Must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve\n"+
		"Where kings command. I was, I must confess,\n"+
		"Great Albion's queen in former golden days:\n"+
		"But now mischance hath trod my title down,\n"+
		"And with dishonour laid me on the ground;\n"+
		"Where I must take like seat unto my fortune,\n"+
		"And to my humble seat conform myself.\n"+
		"KING LEWIS XI\n"+
		"Why, say, fair queen, whence springs this deep despair?\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears\n"+
		"And stops my tongue, while heart is drown'd in cares.\n"+
		"KING LEWIS XI\n"+
		"Whate'er it be, be thou still like thyself,\n"+
		"And sit thee by our side:\n"+
		"Seats her by him\n"+
		"Yield not thy neck\n"+
		"To fortune's yoke, but let thy dauntless mind\n"+
		"Still ride in triumph over all mischance.\n"+
		"Be plain, Queen Margaret, and tell thy grief;\n"+
		"It shall be eased, if France can yield relief.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts\n"+
		"And give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak.\n"+
		"Now, therefore, be it known to noble Lewis,\n"+
		"That Henry, sole possessor of my love,\n"+
		"Is of a king become a banish'd man,\n"+
		"And forced to live in Scotland a forlorn;\n"+
		"While proud ambitious Edward Duke of York\n"+
		"Usurps the regal title and the seat\n"+
		"Of England's true-anointed lawful king.\n"+
		"This is the cause that I, poor Margaret,\n"+
		"With this my son, Prince Edward, Henry's heir,\n"+
		"Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid;\n"+
		"And if thou fail us, all our hope is done:\n"+
		"Scotland hath will to help, but cannot help;\n"+
		"Our people and our peers are both misled,\n"+
		"Our treasures seized, our soldiers put to flight,\n"+
		"And, as thou seest, ourselves in heavy plight.\n"+
		"KING LEWIS XI\n"+
		"Renowned queen, with patience calm the storm,\n"+
		"While we bethink a means to break it off.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe.\n"+
		"KING LEWIS XI\n"+
		"The more I stay, the more I'll succor thee.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"O, but impatience waiteth on true sorrow.\n"+
		"And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow!\n"+
		"Enter WARWICK\n"+
		"KING LEWIS XI\n"+
		"What's he approacheth boldly to our presence?\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Our Earl of Warwick, Edward's greatest friend.\n"+
		"KING LEWIS XI\n"+
		"Welcome, brave Warwick! What brings thee to France?\n"+
		"He descends. She ariseth\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Ay, now begins a second storm to rise;\n"+
		"For this is he that moves both wind and tide.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"From worthy Edward, King of Albion,\n"+
		"My lord and sovereign, and thy vowed friend,\n"+
		"I come, in kindness and unfeigned love,\n"+
		"First, to do greetings to thy royal person;\n"+
		"And then to crave a league of amity;\n"+
		"And lastly, to confirm that amity\n"+
		"With a nuptial knot, if thou vouchsafe to grant\n"+
		"That virtuous Lady Bona, thy fair sister,\n"+
		"To England's king in lawful marriage.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"[Aside] If that go forward, Henry's hope is done.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"[To BONA] And, gracious madam, in our king's behalf,\n"+
		"I am commanded, with your leave and favour,\n"+
		"Humbly to kiss your hand, and with my tongue\n"+
		"To tell the passion of my sovereign's heart;\n"+
		"Where fame, late entering at his heedful ears,\n"+
		"Hath placed thy beauty's image and thy virtue.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak,\n"+
		"Before you answer Warwick. His demand\n"+
		"Springs not from Edward's well-meant honest love,\n"+
		"But from deceit bred by necessity;\n"+
		"For how can tyrants safely govern home,\n"+
		"Unless abroad they purchase great alliance?\n"+
		"To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice,\n"+
		"That Henry liveth still: but were he dead,\n"+
		"Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry's son.\n"+
		"Look, therefore, Lewis, that by this league and marriage\n"+
		"Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour;\n"+
		"For though usurpers sway the rule awhile,\n"+
		"Yet heavens are just, and time suppresseth wrongs.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Injurious Margaret!\n"+
		"PRINCE EDWARD\n"+
		"And why not queen?\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Because thy father Henry did usurp;\n"+
		"And thou no more are prince than she is queen.\n"+
		"OXFORD\n"+
		"Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,\n"+
		"Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain;\n"+
		"And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,\n"+
		"Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest;\n"+
		"And, after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,\n"+
		"Who by his prowess conquered all France:\n"+
		"From these our Henry lineally descends.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Oxford, how haps it, in this smooth discourse,\n"+
		"You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost\n"+
		"All that which Henry Fifth had gotten?\n"+
		"Methinks these peers of France should smile at that.\n"+
		"But for the rest, you tell a pedigree\n"+
		"Of threescore and two years; a silly time\n"+
		"To make prescription for a kingdom's worth.\n"+
		"OXFORD\n"+
		"Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,\n"+
		"Whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years,\n"+
		"And not bewray thy treason with a blush?\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Can Oxford, that did ever fence the right,\n"+
		"Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree?\n"+
		"For shame! leave Henry, and call Edward king.\n"+
		"OXFORD\n"+
		"Call him my king by whose injurious doom\n"+
		"My elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere,\n"+
		"Was done to death? and more than so, my father,\n"+
		"Even in the downfall of his mellow'd years,\n"+
		"When nature brought him to the door of death?\n"+
		"No, Warwick, no; while life upholds this arm,\n"+
		"This arm upholds the house of Lancaster.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"And I the house of York.\n"+
		"KING LEWIS XI\n"+
		"Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford,\n"+
		"Vouchsafe, at our request, to stand aside,\n"+
		"While I use further conference with Warwick.\n"+
		"They stand aloof\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Heavens grant that Warwick's words bewitch him not!\n"+
		"KING LEWIS XI\n"+
		"Now Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience,\n"+
		"Is Edward your true king? for I were loath\n"+
		"To link with him that were not lawful chosen.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour.\n"+
		"KING LEWIS XI\n"+
		"But is he gracious in the people's eye?\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"The more that Henry was unfortunate.\n"+
		"KING LEWIS XI\n"+
		"Then further, all dissembling set aside,\n"+
		"Tell me for truth the measure of his love\n"+
		"Unto our sister Bona.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Such it seems\n"+
		"As may beseem a monarch like himself.\n"+
		"Myself have often heard him say and swear\n"+
		"That this his love was an eternal plant,\n"+
		"Whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground,\n"+
		"The leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun,\n"+
		"Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,\n"+
		"Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain.\n"+
		"KING LEWIS XI\n"+
		"Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.\n"+
		"BONA\n"+
		"Your grant, or your denial, shall be mine:\n"+
		"To WARWICK\n"+
		"Yet I confess that often ere this day,\n"+
		"When I have heard your king's desert recounted,\n"+
		"Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire.\n"+
		"KING LEWIS XI\n"+
		"Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward's;\n"+
		"And now forthwith shall articles be drawn\n"+
		"Touching the jointure that your king must make,\n"+
		"Which with her dowry shall be counterpoised.\n"+
		"Draw near, Queen Margaret, and be a witness\n"+
		"That Bona shall be wife to the English king.\n"+
		"PRINCE EDWARD\n"+
		"To Edward, but not to the English king.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Deceitful Warwick! it was thy device\n"+
		"By this alliance to make void my suit:\n"+
		"Before thy coming Lewis was Henry's friend.\n"+
		"KING LEWIS XI\n"+
		"And still is friend to him and Margaret:\n"+
		"But if your title to the crown be weak,\n"+
		"As may appear by Edward's good success,\n"+
		"Then 'tis but reason that I be released\n"+
		"From giving aid which late I promised.\n"+
		"Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand\n"+
		"That your estate requires and mine can yield.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease,\n"+
		"Where having nothing, nothing can he lose.\n"+
		"And as for you yourself, our quondam queen,\n"+
		"You have a father able to maintain you;\n"+
		"And better 'twere you troubled him than France.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick, peace,\n"+
		"Proud setter up and puller down of kings!\n"+
		"I will not hence, till, with my talk and tears,\n"+
		"Both full of truth, I make King Lewis behold\n"+
		"Thy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love;\n"+
		"For both of you are birds of selfsame feather.\n"+
		"Post blows a horn within\n"+
		"KING LEWIS XI\n"+
		"Warwick, this is some post to us or thee.\n"+
		"Enter a Post\n"+
		"Post\n"+
		"[To WARWICK] My lord ambassador, these letters are for you,\n"+
		"Sent from your brother, Marquess Montague:\n"+
		"To KING LEWIS XI\n"+
		"These from our king unto your majesty:\n"+
		"To QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"And, madam, these for you; from whom I know not.\n"+
		"They all read their letters\n"+
		"OXFORD\n"+
		"I like it well that our fair queen and mistress\n"+
		"Smiles at her news, while Warwick frowns at his.\n"+
		"PRINCE EDWARD\n"+
		"Nay, mark how Lewis stamps, as he were nettled:\n"+
		"I hope all's for the best.\n"+
		"KING LEWIS XI\n"+
		"Warwick, what are thy news? and yours, fair queen?\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Mine, such as fill my heart with unhoped joys.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Mine, full of sorrow and heart's discontent.\n"+
		"KING LEWIS XI\n"+
		"What! has your king married the Lady Grey!\n"+
		"And now, to soothe your forgery and his,\n"+
		"Sends me a paper to persuade me patience?\n"+
		"Is this the alliance that he seeks with France?\n"+
		"Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner?\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"I told your majesty as much before:\n"+
		"This proveth Edward's love and Warwick's honesty.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"King Lewis, I here protest, in sight of heaven,\n"+
		"And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss,\n"+
		"That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward's,\n"+
		"No more my king, for he dishonours me,\n"+
		"But most himself, if he could see his shame.\n"+
		"Did I forget that by the house of York\n"+
		"My father came untimely to his death?\n"+
		"Did I let pass the abuse done to my niece?\n"+
		"Did I impale him with the regal crown?\n"+
		"Did I put Henry from his native right?\n"+
		"And am I guerdon'd at the last with shame?\n"+
		"Shame on himself! for my desert is honour:\n"+
		"And to repair my honour lost for him,\n"+
		"I here renounce him and return to Henry.\n"+
		"My noble queen, let former grudges pass,\n"+
		"And henceforth I am thy true servitor:\n"+
		"I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona,\n"+
		"And replant Henry in his former state.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Warwick, these words have turn'd my hate to love;\n"+
		"And I forgive and quite forget old faults,\n"+
		"And joy that thou becomest King Henry's friend.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"So much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend,\n"+
		"That, if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us\n"+
		"With some few bands of chosen soldiers,\n"+
		"I'll undertake to land them on our coast\n"+
		"And force the tyrant from his seat by war.\n"+
		"'Tis not his new-made bride shall succor him:\n"+
		"And as for Clarence, as my letters tell me,\n"+
		"He's very likely now to fall from him,\n"+
		"For matching more for wanton lust than honour,\n"+
		"Or than for strength and safety of our country.\n"+
		"BONA\n"+
		"Dear brother, how shall Bona be revenged\n"+
		"But by thy help to this distressed queen?\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Renowned prince, how shall poor Henry live,\n"+
		"Unless thou rescue him from foul despair?\n"+
		"BONA\n"+
		"My quarrel and this English queen's are one.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"And mine, fair lady Bona, joins with yours.\n"+
		"KING LEWIS XI\n"+
		"And mine with hers, and thine, and Margaret's.\n"+
		"Therefore at last I firmly am resolved\n"+
		"You shall have aid.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Let me give humble thanks for all at once.\n"+
		"KING LEWIS XI\n"+
		"Then, England's messenger, return in post,\n"+
		"And tell false Edward, thy supposed king,\n"+
		"That Lewis of France is sending over masquers\n"+
		"To revel it with him and his new bride:\n"+
		"Thou seest what's past, go fear thy king withal.\n"+
		"BONA\n"+
		"Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,\n"+
		"I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Tell him, my mourning weeds are laid aside,\n"+
		"And I am ready to put armour on.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,\n"+
		"And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.\n"+
		"There's thy reward: be gone.\n"+
		"Exit Post\n"+
		"KING LEWIS XI\n"+
		"But, Warwick,\n"+
		"Thou and Oxford, with five thousand men,\n"+
		"Shall cross the seas, and bid false Edward battle;\n"+
		"And, as occasion serves, this noble queen\n"+
		"And prince shall follow with a fresh supply.\n"+
		"Yet, ere thou go, but answer me one doubt,\n"+
		"What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty?\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"This shall assure my constant loyalty,\n"+
		"That if our queen and this young prince agree,\n"+
		"I'll join mine eldest daughter and my joy\n"+
		"To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Yes, I agree, and thank you for your motion.\n"+
		"Son Edward, she is fair and virtuous,\n"+
		"Therefore delay not, give thy hand to Warwick;\n"+
		"And, with thy hand, thy faith irrevocable,\n"+
		"That only Warwick's daughter shall be thine.\n"+
		"PRINCE EDWARD\n"+
		"Yes, I accept her, for she well deserves it;\n"+
		"And here, to pledge my vow, I give my hand.\n"+
		"He gives his hand to WARWICK\n"+
		"KING LEWIS XI\n"+
		"Why stay we now? These soldiers shall be levied,\n"+
		"And thou, Lord Bourbon, our high admiral,\n"+
		"Shalt waft them over with our royal fleet.\n"+
		"I long till Edward fall by war's mischance,\n"+
		"For mocking marriage with a dame of France.\n"+
		"Exeunt all but WARWICK\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"I came from Edward as ambassador,\n"+
		"But I return his sworn and mortal foe:\n"+
		"Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me,\n"+
		"But dreadful war shall answer his demand.\n"+
		"Had he none else to make a stale but me?\n"+
		"Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow.\n"+
		"I was the chief that raised him to the crown,\n"+
		"And I'll be chief to bring him down again:\n"+
		"Not that I pity Henry's misery,\n"+
		"But seek revenge on Edward's mockery.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"ACT IV\n"+
		"SCENE I. London. The palace.\n"+
		"Enter GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, SOMERSET, and MONTAGUE\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Now tell me, brother Clarence, what think you\n"+
		"Of this new marriage with the Lady Grey?\n"+
		"Hath not our brother made a worthy choice?\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"Alas, you know, 'tis far from hence to France;\n"+
		"How could he stay till Warwick made return?\n"+
		"SOMERSET\n"+
		"My lords, forbear this talk; here comes the king.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"And his well-chosen bride.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"I mind to tell him plainly what I think.\n"+
		"Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV, attended; QUEEN ELIZABETH, PEMBROKE, STAFFORD, HASTINGS, and others\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Now, brother of Clarence, how like you our choice,\n"+
		"That you stand pensive, as half malcontent?\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"As well as Lewis of France, or the Earl of Warwick,\n"+
		"Which are so weak of courage and in judgment\n"+
		"That they'll take no offence at our abuse.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Suppose they take offence without a cause,\n"+
		"They are but Lewis and Warwick: I am Edward,\n"+
		"Your king and Warwick's, and must have my will.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"And shall have your will, because our king:\n"+
		"Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Yea, brother Richard, are you offended too?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Not I:\n"+
		"No, God forbid that I should wish them sever'd\n"+
		"Whom God hath join'd together; ay, and 'twere pity\n"+
		"To sunder them that yoke so well together.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Setting your scorns and your mislike aside,\n"+
		"Tell me some reason why the Lady Grey\n"+
		"Should not become my wife and England's queen.\n"+
		"And you too, Somerset and Montague,\n"+
		"Speak freely what you think.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"Then this is mine opinion: that King Lewis\n"+
		"Becomes your enemy, for mocking him\n"+
		"About the marriage of the Lady Bona.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"And Warwick, doing what you gave in charge,\n"+
		"Is now dishonoured by this new marriage.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeased\n"+
		"By such invention as I can devise?\n"+
		"MONTAGUE\n"+
		"Yet, to have join'd with France in such alliance\n"+
		"Would more have strengthen'd this our commonwealth\n"+
		"'Gainst foreign storms than any home-bred marriage.\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"Why, knows not Montague that of itself\n"+
		"England is safe, if true within itself?\n"+
		"MONTAGUE\n"+
		"But the safer when 'tis back'd with France.\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"'Tis better using France than trusting France:\n"+
		"Let us be back'd with God and with the seas\n"+
		"Which He hath given for fence impregnable,\n"+
		"And with their helps only defend ourselves;\n"+
		"In them and in ourselves our safety lies.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves\n"+
		"To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Ay, what of that? it was my will and grant;\n"+
		"And for this once my will shall stand for law.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"And yet methinks your grace hath not done well,\n"+
		"To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales\n"+
		"Unto the brother of your loving bride;\n"+
		"She better would have fitted me or Clarence:\n"+
		"But in your bride you bury brotherhood.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"Or else you would not have bestow'd the heir\n"+
		"Of the Lord Bonville on your new wife's son,\n"+
		"And leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Alas, poor Clarence! is it for a wife\n"+
		"That thou art malcontent? I will provide thee.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"In choosing for yourself, you show'd your judgment,\n"+
		"Which being shallow, you give me leave\n"+
		"To play the broker in mine own behalf;\n"+
		"And to that end I shortly mind to leave you.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Leave me, or tarry, Edward will be king,\n"+
		"And not be tied unto his brother's will.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"My lords, before it pleased his majesty\n"+
		"To raise my state to title of a queen,\n"+
		"Do me but right, and you must all confess\n"+
		"That I was not ignoble of descent;\n"+
		"And meaner than myself have had like fortune.\n"+
		"But as this title honours me and mine,\n"+
		"So your dislike, to whom I would be pleasing,\n"+
		"Doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns:\n"+
		"What danger or what sorrow can befall thee,\n"+
		"So long as Edward is thy constant friend,\n"+
		"And their true sovereign, whom they must obey?\n"+
		"Nay, whom they shall obey, and love thee too,\n"+
		"Unless they seek for hatred at my hands;\n"+
		"Which if they do, yet will I keep thee safe,\n"+
		"And they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"[Aside] I hear, yet say not much, but think the more.\n"+
		"Enter a Post\n"+

		"Now, messenger, what letters or what news\n"+
		"From France?\n"+
		"Post\n"+
		"My sovereign liege, no letters; and few words,\n"+
		"But such as I, without your special pardon,\n"+
		"Dare not relate.\n"+

		"Is Lewis so brave? belike he thinks me Henry.\n"+
		"But what said Lady Bona to my marriage?\n"+
		"Post\n"+
		"These were her words, utter'd with mad disdain:\n"+
		"'Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,\n"+
		"I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.'\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"I blame not her, she could say little less;\n"+
		"She had the wrong. But what said Henry's queen?\n"+
		"For I have heard that she was there in place.\n"+
		"Post\n"+
		"'Tell him,' quoth she, 'my mourning weeds are done,\n"+
		"And I am ready to put armour on.'\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Belike she minds to play the Amazon.\n"+
		"But what said Warwick to these injuries?\n"+
		"Post\n"+
		"He, more incensed against your majesty\n"+
		"Than all the rest, discharged me with these words:\n"+
		"'Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,\n"+
		"And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.'\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Ha! durst the traitor breathe out so proud words?\n"+
		"Well I will arm me, being thus forewarn'd:\n"+
		"They shall have wars and pay for their presumption.\n"+
		"But say, is Warwick friends with Margaret?\n"+
		"Post\n"+
		"Ay, gracious sovereign; they are so link'd in\n"+
		"friendship\n"+
		"That young Prince Edward marries Warwick's daughter.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"Belike the elder; Clarence will have the younger.\n"+
		"Now, brother king, farewell, and sit you fast,\n"+
		"For I will hence to Warwick's other daughter;\n"+
		"That, though I want a kingdom, yet in marriage\n"+
		"I may not prove inferior to yourself.\n"+
		"You that love me and Warwick, follow me.\n"+
		"Exit CLARENCE, and SOMERSET follows\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"[Aside] Not I:\n"+
		"My thoughts aim at a further matter; I\n"+
		"Stay not for the love of Edward, but the crown.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick!\n"+
		"Yet am I arm'd against the worst can happen;\n"+
		"And haste is needful in this desperate case.\n"+
		"Pembroke and Stafford, you in our behalf\n"+
		"Go levy men, and make prepare for war;\n"+
		"They are already, or quickly will be landed:\n"+
		"Myself in person will straight follow you.\n"+
		"Exeunt PEMBROKE and STAFFORD\n"+
		"But, ere I go, Hastings and Montague,\n"+
		"Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,\n"+
		"Are near to Warwick by blood and by alliance:\n"+
		"Tell me if you love Warwick more than me?\n"+
		"If it be so, then both depart to him;\n"+
		"I rather wish you foes than hollow friends:\n"+
		"But if you mind to hold your true obedience,\n"+
		"Give me assurance with some friendly vow,\n"+
		"That I may never have you in suspect.\n"+
		"MONTAGUE\n"+
		"So God help Montague as he proves true!\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"And Hastings as he favours Edward's cause!\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Now, brother Richard, will you stand by us?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Ay, in despite of all that shall withstand you.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Why, so! then am I sure of victory.\n"+
		"Now therefore let us hence; and lose no hour,\n"+
		"Till we meet Warwick with his foreign power.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. A plain in Warwickshire.\n"+
		"Enter WARWICK and OXFORD, with French soldiers\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Trust me, my lord, all hitherto goes well;\n"+
		"The common people by numbers swarm to us.\n"+
		"Enter CLARENCE and SOMERSET\n"+
		"But see where Somerset and Clarence come!\n"+
		"Speak suddenly, my lords, are we all friends?\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"Fear not that, my lord.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Then, gentle Clarence, welcome unto Warwick;\n"+
		"And welcome, Somerset: I hold it cowardice\n"+
		"To rest mistrustful where a noble heart\n"+
		"Hath pawn'd an open hand in sign of love;\n"+
		"Else might I think that Clarence, Edward's brother,\n"+
		"Were but a feigned friend to our proceedings:\n"+
		"But welcome, sweet Clarence; my daughter shall be thine.\n"+
		"And now what rests but, in night's coverture,\n"+
		"Thy brother being carelessly encamp'd,\n"+
		"His soldiers lurking in the towns about,\n"+
		"And but attended by a simple guard,\n"+
		"We may surprise and take him at our pleasure?\n"+
		"Our scouts have found the adventure very easy:\n"+
		"That as Ulysses and stout Diomede\n"+
		"With sleight and manhood stole to Rhesus' tents,\n"+
		"And brought from thence the Thracian fatal steeds,\n"+
		"So we, well cover'd with the night's black mantle,\n"+
		"At unawares may beat down Edward's guard\n"+
		"And seize himself; I say not, slaughter him,\n"+
		"For I intend but only to surprise him.\n"+
		"You that will follow me to this attempt,\n"+
		"Applaud the name of Henry with your leader.\n"+
		"They all cry, 'Henry!'\n"+
		"Why, then, let's on our way in silent sort:\n"+
		"For Warwick and his friends, God and Saint George!\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. Edward's camp, near Warwick.\n"+
		"Enter three Watchmen, to guard KING EDWARD IV's tent\n"+
		"First Watchman\n"+
		"Come on, my masters, each man take his stand:\n"+
		"The king by this is set him down to sleep.\n"+
		"Second Watchman\n"+
		"What, will he not to bed?\n"+
		"First Watchman\n"+
		"Why, no; for he hath made a solemn vow\n"+
		"Never to lie and take his natural rest\n"+
		"Till Warwick or himself be quite suppress'd.\n"+
		"Second Watchman\n"+
		"To-morrow then belike shall be the day,\n"+
		"If Warwick be so near as men report.\n"+
		"Third Watchman\n"+
		"But say, I pray, what nobleman is that\n"+
		"That with the king here resteth in his tent?\n"+
		"First Watchman\n"+
		"'Tis the Lord Hastings, the king's chiefest friend.\n"+
		"Third Watchman\n"+
		"O, is it so? But why commands the king\n"+
		"That his chief followers lodge in towns about him,\n"+
		"While he himself keeps in the cold field?\n"+
		"Second Watchman\n"+
		"'Tis the more honour, because more dangerous.\n"+
		"Third Watchman\n"+
		"Ay, but give me worship and quietness;\n"+
		"I like it better than a dangerous honour.\n"+
		"If Warwick knew in what estate he stands,\n"+
		"'Tis to be doubted he would waken him.\n"+
		"First Watchman\n"+
		"Unless our halberds did shut up his passage.\n"+
		"Second Watchman\n"+
		"Ay, wherefore else guard we his royal tent,\n"+
		"But to defend his person from night-foes?\n"+
		"Enter WARWICK, CLARENCE, OXFORD, SOMERSET, and French soldiers, silent all\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"This is his tent; and see where stand his guard.\n"+
		"Courage, my masters! honour now or never!\n"+
		"But follow me, and Edward shall be ours.\n"+
		"First Watchman\n"+
		"Who goes there?\n"+
		"Second Watchman\n"+
		"Stay, or thou diest!\n"+
		"WARWICK and the rest cry all, 'Warwick! Warwick!' and set upon the Guard, who fly, crying, 'Arm! arm!' WARWICK and the rest following them\n"+
		"The drum playing and trumpet sounding, reenter WARWICK, SOMERSET, and the rest, bringing KING EDWARD IV out in his gown, sitting in a chair. RICHARD and HASTINGS fly over the stage\n"+
		"SOMERSET\n"+
		"What are they that fly there?\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Richard and Hastings: let them go; here is The duke.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"The duke! Why, Warwick, when we parted,\n"+
		"Thou call'dst me king.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Ay, but the case is alter'd:\n"+
		"When you disgraced me in my embassade,\n"+
		"Then I degraded you from being king,\n"+
		"And come now to create you Duke of York.\n"+
		"Alas! how should you govern any kingdom,\n"+
		"That know not how to use ambassadors,\n"+
		"Nor how to be contented with one wife,\n"+
		"Nor how to use your brothers brotherly,\n"+
		"Nor how to study for the people's welfare,\n"+
		"Nor how to shroud yourself from enemies?\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Yea, brother of Clarence, are thou here too?\n"+
		"Nay, then I see that Edward needs must down.\n"+
		"Yet, Warwick, in despite of all mischance,\n"+
		"Of thee thyself and all thy complices,\n"+
		"Edward will always bear himself as king:\n"+
		"Though fortune's malice overthrow my state,\n"+
		"My mind exceeds the compass of her wheel.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Then, for his mind, be Edward England's king:\n"+
		"Takes off his crown\n"+
		"But Henry now shall wear the English crown,\n"+
		"And be true king indeed, thou but the shadow.\n"+
		"My Lord of Somerset, at my request,\n"+
		"See that forthwith Duke Edward be convey'd\n"+
		"Unto my brother, Archbishop of York.\n"+
		"When I have fought with Pembroke and his fellows,\n"+
		"I'll follow you, and tell what answer\n"+
		"Lewis and the Lady Bona send to him.\n"+
		"Now, for a while farewell, good Duke of York.\n"+
		"They lead him out forcibly\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"What fates impose, that men must needs abide;\n"+
		"It boots not to resist both wind and tide.\n"+
		"Exit, guarded\n"+
		"OXFORD\n"+
		"What now remains, my lords, for us to do\n"+
		"But march to London with our soldiers?\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Ay, that's the first thing that we have to do;\n"+
		"To free King Henry from imprisonment\n"+
		"And see him seated in the regal throne.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV. London. The palace.\n"+
		"Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH and RIVERS\n"+
		"RIVERS\n"+
		"Madam, what makes you in this sudden change?\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"Why brother Rivers, are you yet to learn\n"+
		"What late misfortune is befall'n King Edward?\n"+
		"RIVERS\n"+
		"What! loss of some pitch'd battle against Warwick?\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"No, but the loss of his own royal person.\n"+
		"RIVERS\n"+
		"Then is my sovereign slain?\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"Ay, almost slain, for he is taken prisoner,\n"+
		"Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard\n"+
		"Or by his foe surprised at unawares:\n"+
		"And, as I further have to understand,\n"+
		"Is new committed to the Bishop of York,\n"+
		"Fell Warwick's brother and by that our foe.\n"+
		"RIVERS\n"+
		"These news I must confess are full of grief;\n"+
		"Yet, gracious madam, bear it as you may:\n"+
		"Warwick may lose, that now hath won the day.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"Till then fair hope must hinder life's decay.\n"+
		"And I the rather wean me from despair\n"+
		"For love of Edward's offspring in my womb:\n"+
		"This is it that makes me bridle passion\n"+
		"And bear with mildness my misfortune's cross;\n"+
		"Ay, ay, for this I draw in many a tear\n"+
		"And stop the rising of blood-sucking sighs,\n"+
		"Lest with my sighs or tears I blast or drown\n"+
		"King Edward's fruit, true heir to the English crown.\n"+
		"RIVERS\n"+
		"But, madam, where is Warwick then become?\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"I am inform'd that he comes towards London,\n"+
		"To set the crown once more on Henry's head:\n"+
		"Guess thou the rest; King Edward's friends must down,\n"+
		"But, to prevent the tyrant's violence,--\n"+
		"For trust not him that hath once broken faith,--\n"+
		"I'll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary,\n"+
		"To save at least the heir of Edward's right:\n"+
		"There shall I rest secure from force and fraud.\n"+
		"Come, therefore, let us fly while we may fly:\n"+
		"If Warwick take us we are sure to die.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE V. A park near Middleham Castle In Yorkshire.\n"+
		"Enter GLOUCESTER, HASTINGS, and STANLEY\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Now, my Lord Hastings and Sir William Stanley,\n"+
		"Leave off to wonder why I drew you hither,\n"+
		"Into this chiefest thicket of the park.\n"+
		"Thus stands the case: you know our king, my brother,\n"+
		"Is prisoner to the bishop here, at whose hands\n"+
		"He hath good usage and great liberty,\n"+
		"And, often but attended with weak guard,\n"+
		"Comes hunting this way to disport himself.\n"+
		"I have advertised him by secret means\n"+
		"That if about this hour he make his way\n"+
		"Under the colour of his usual game,\n"+
		"He shall here find his friends with horse and men\n"+
		"To set him free from his captivity.\n"+
		"Enter KING EDWARD IV and a Huntsman with him\n"+
		"Huntsman\n"+
		"This way, my lord; for this way lies the game.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Nay, this way, man: see where the huntsmen stand.\n"+
		"Now, brother of Gloucester, Lord Hastings, and the rest,\n"+
		"Stand you thus close, to steal the bishop's deer?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Brother, the time and case requireth haste:\n"+
		"Your horse stands ready at the park-corner.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"But whither shall we then?\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"To Lynn, my lord,\n"+
		"And ship from thence to Flanders.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Well guess'd, believe me; for that was my meaning.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Stanley, I will requite thy forwardness.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"But wherefore stay we? 'tis no time to talk.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Huntsman, what say'st thou? wilt thou go along?\n"+
		"Huntsman\n"+
		"Better do so than tarry and be hang'd.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Come then, away; let's ha' no more ado.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Bishop, farewell: shield thee from Warwick's frown;\n"+
		"And pray that I may repossess the crown.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE VI. London. The Tower.\n"+
		"Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI, CLARENCE, WARWICK, SOMERSET, HENRY OF RICHMOND, OXFORD, MONTAGUE, and Lieutenant of the Tower\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Master lieutenant, now that God and friends\n"+
		"Have shaken Edward from the regal seat,\n"+
		"And turn'd my captive state to liberty,\n"+
		"My fear to hope, my sorrows unto joys,\n"+
		"At our enlargement what are thy due fees?\n"+
		"Lieutenant\n"+
		"Subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns;\n"+
		"But if an humble prayer may prevail,\n"+
		"I then crave pardon of your majesty.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"For what, lieutenant? for well using me?\n"+
		"Nay, be thou sure I'll well requite thy kindness,\n"+
		"For that it made my imprisonment a pleasure;\n"+
		"Ay, such a pleasure as incaged birds\n"+
		"Conceive when after many moody thoughts\n"+
		"At last by notes of household harmony\n"+
		"They quite forget their loss of liberty.\n"+
		"But, Warwick, after God, thou set'st me free,\n"+
		"And chiefly therefore I thank God and thee;\n"+
		"He was the author, thou the instrument.\n"+
		"Therefore, that I may conquer fortune's spite\n"+
		"By living low, where fortune cannot hurt me,\n"+
		"And that the people of this blessed land\n"+
		"May not be punish'd with my thwarting stars,\n"+
		"Warwick, although my head still wear the crown,\n"+
		"I here resign my government to thee,\n"+
		"For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Your grace hath still been famed for virtuous;\n"+
		"And now may seem as wise as virtuous,\n"+
		"By spying and avoiding fortune's malice,\n"+
		"For few men rightly temper with the stars:\n"+
		"Yet in this one thing let me blame your grace,\n"+
		"For choosing me when Clarence is in place.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"No, Warwick, thou art worthy of the sway,\n"+
		"To whom the heavens in thy nativity\n"+
		"Adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown,\n"+
		"As likely to be blest in peace and war;\n"+
		"And therefore I yield thee my free consent.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"And I choose Clarence only for protector.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Warwick and Clarence give me both your hands:\n"+
		"Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts,\n"+
		"That no dissension hinder government:\n"+
		"I make you both protectors of this land,\n"+
		"While I myself will lead a private life\n"+
		"And in devotion spend my latter days,\n"+
		"To sin's rebuke and my Creator's praise.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"What answers Clarence to his sovereign's will?\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"That he consents, if Warwick yield consent;\n"+
		"For on thy fortune I repose myself.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Why, then, though loath, yet must I be content:\n"+
		"We'll yoke together, like a double shadow\n"+
		"To Henry's body, and supply his place;\n"+
		"I mean, in bearing weight of government,\n"+
		"While he enjoys the honour and his ease.\n"+
		"And, Clarence, now then it is more than needful\n"+
		"Forthwith that Edward be pronounced a traitor,\n"+
		"And all his lands and goods be confiscate.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"What else? and that succession be determined.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Ay, therein Clarence shall not want his part.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"But, with the first of all your chief affairs,\n"+
		"Let me entreat, for I command no more,\n"+
		"That Margaret your queen and my son Edward\n"+
		"Be sent for, to return from France with speed;\n"+
		"For, till I see them here, by doubtful fear\n"+
		"My joy of liberty is half eclipsed.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"It shall be done, my sovereign, with all speed.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"My Lord of Somerset, what youth is that,\n"+
		"Of whom you seem to have so tender care?\n"+
		"SOMERSET\n"+
		"My liege, it is young Henry, earl of Richmond.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Come hither, England's hope.\n"+
		"Lays his hand on his head\n"+
		"If secret powers\n"+
		"Suggest but truth to my divining thoughts,\n"+
		"This pretty lad will prove our country's bliss.\n"+
		"His looks are full of peaceful majesty,\n"+
		"His head by nature framed to wear a crown,\n"+
		"His hand to wield a sceptre, and himself\n"+
		"Likely in time to bless a regal throne.\n"+
		"Make much of him, my lords, for this is he\n"+
		"Must help you more than you are hurt by me.\n"+
		"Enter a Post\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"What news, my friend?\n"+
		"Post\n"+
		"That Edward is escaped from your brother,\n"+
		"And fled, as he hears since, to Burgundy.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Unsavoury news! but how made he escape?\n"+
		"Post\n"+
		"He was convey'd by Richard Duke of Gloucester\n"+
		"And the Lord Hastings, who attended him\n"+
		"In secret ambush on the forest side\n"+
		"And from the bishop's huntsmen rescued him;\n"+
		"For hunting was his daily exercise.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"My brother was too careless of his charge.\n"+
		"But let us hence, my sovereign, to provide\n"+
		"A salve for any sore that may betide.\n"+
		"Exeunt all but SOMERSET, HENRY OF RICHMOND, and OXFORD\n"+
		"SOMERSET\n"+
		"My lord, I like not of this flight of Edward's;\n"+
		"For doubtless Burgundy will yield him help,\n"+
		"And we shall have more wars before 't be long.\n"+
		"As Henry's late presaging prophecy\n"+
		"Did glad my heart with hope of this young Richmond,\n"+
		"So doth my heart misgive me, in these conflicts\n"+
		"What may befall him, to his harm and ours:\n"+
		"Therefore, Lord Oxford, to prevent the worst,\n"+
		"Forthwith we'll send him hence to Brittany,\n"+
		"Till storms be past of civil enmity.\n"+
		"OXFORD\n"+
		"Ay, for if Edward repossess the crown,\n"+
		"'Tis like that Richmond with the rest shall down.\n"+
		"SOMERSET\n"+
		"It shall be so; he shall to Brittany.\n"+
		"Come, therefore, let's about it speedily.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE VII. Before York.\n"+
		"Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV, GLOUCESTER, HASTINGS, and Soldiers\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Now, brother Richard, Lord Hastings, and the rest,\n"+
		"Yet thus far fortune maketh us amends,\n"+
		"And says that once more I shall interchange\n"+
		"My waned state for Henry's regal crown.\n"+
		"Well have we pass'd and now repass'd the seas\n"+
		"And brought desired help from Burgundy:\n"+
		"What then remains, we being thus arrived\n"+
		"From Ravenspurgh haven before the gates of York,\n"+
		"But that we enter, as into our dukedom?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"The gates made fast! Brother, I like not this;\n"+
		"For many men that stumble at the threshold\n"+
		"Are well foretold that danger lurks within.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Tush, man, abodements must not now affright us:\n"+
		"By fair or foul means we must enter in,\n"+
		"For hither will our friends repair to us.\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"My liege, I'll knock once more to summon them.\n"+
		"Enter, on the walls, the Mayor of York, and his Brethren\n"+
		"Mayor\n"+
		"My lords, we were forewarned of your coming,\n"+
		"And shut the gates for safety of ourselves;\n"+
		"For now we owe allegiance unto Henry.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"But, master mayor, if Henry be your king,\n"+
		"Yet Edward at the least is Duke of York.\n"+
		"Mayor\n"+
		"True, my good lord; I know you for no less.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Why, and I challenge nothing but my dukedom,\n"+
		"As being well content with that alone.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"[Aside] But when the fox hath once got in his nose,\n"+
		"He'll soon find means to make the body follow.\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"Why, master mayor, why stand you in a doubt?\n"+
		"Open the gates; we are King Henry's friends.\n"+
		"Mayor\n"+
		"Ay, say you so? the gates shall then be open'd.\n"+
		"They descend\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"A wise stout captain, and soon persuaded!\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"The good old man would fain that all were well,\n"+
		"So 'twere not 'long of him; but being enter'd,\n"+
		"I doubt not, I, but we shall soon persuade\n"+
		"Both him and all his brothers unto reason.\n"+
		"Enter the Mayor and two Aldermen, below\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"So, master mayor: these gates must not be shut\n"+
		"But in the night or in the time of war.\n"+
		"What! fear not, man, but yield me up the keys;\n"+
		"Takes his keys\n"+
		"For Edward will defend the town and thee,\n"+
		"And all those friends that deign to follow me.\n"+
		"March. Enter MONTGOMERY, with drum and soldiers\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Brother, this is Sir John Montgomery,\n"+
		"Our trusty friend, unless I be deceived.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Welcome, Sir John! But why come you in arms?\n"+
		"MONTAGUE\n"+
		"To help King Edward in his time of storm,\n"+
		"As every loyal subject ought to do.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Thanks, good Montgomery; but we now forget\n"+
		"Our title to the crown and only claim\n"+
		"Our dukedom till God please to send the rest.\n"+
		"MONTAGUE\n"+
		"Then fare you well, for I will hence again:\n"+
		"I came to serve a king and not a duke.\n"+
		"Drummer, strike up, and let us march away.\n"+
		"The drum begins to march\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Nay, stay, Sir John, awhi le, and we'll debate\n"+
		"By what safe means the crown may be recover'd.\n"+
		"MONTAGUE\n"+
		"What talk you of debating? in few words,\n"+
		"If you'll not here proclaim yourself our king,\n"+
		"I'll leave you to your fortune and be gone\n"+
		"To keep them back that come to succor you:\n"+
		"Why shall we fight, if you pretend no title?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Why, brother, wherefore stand you on nice points?\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"When we grow stronger, then we'll make our claim:\n"+
		"Till then, 'tis wisdom to conceal our meaning.\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"Away with scrupulous wit! now arms must rule.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns.\n"+
		"Brother, we will proclaim you out of hand:\n"+
		"The bruit thereof will bring you many friends.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Then be it as you will; for 'tis my right,\n"+
		"And Henry but usurps the diadem.\n"+
		"MONTAGUE\n"+
		"Ay, now my sovereign speaketh like himself;\n"+
		"And now will I be Edward's champion.\n"+
		"HASTINGS\n"+
		"Sound trumpet; Edward shall be here proclaim'd:\n"+
		"Come, fellow-soldier, make thou proclamation.\n"+
		"Flourish\n"+
		"Soldier\n"+
		"Edward the Fourth, by the grace of God, king of\n"+
		"England and France, and lord of Ireland, & c.\n"+
		"MONTAGUE\n"+
		"And whosoe'er gainsays King Edward's right,\n"+
		"By this I challenge him to single fight.\n"+
		"Throws down his gauntlet\n"+
		"All\n"+
		"Long live Edward the Fourth!\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Thanks, brave Montgomery; and thanks unto you all:\n"+
		"If fortune serve me, I'll requite this kindness.\n"+
		"Now, for this night, let's harbour here in York;\n"+
		"And when the morning sun shall raise his car\n"+
		"Above the border of this horizon,\n"+
		"We'll forward towards Warwick and his mates;\n"+
		"For well I wot that Henry is no soldier.\n"+
		"Ah, froward Clarence! how evil it beseems thee\n"+
		"To flatter Henry and forsake thy brother!\n"+
		"Yet, as we may, we'll meet both thee and Warwick.\n"+
		"Come on, brave soldiers: doubt not of the day,\n"+
		"And, that once gotten, doubt not of large pay.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE VIII. London. The palace.\n"+
		"Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI, WARWICK, MONTAGUE, CLARENCE, EXETER, and OXFORD\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"What counsel, lords? Edward from Belgia,\n"+
		"With hasty Germans and blunt Hollanders,\n"+
		"Hath pass'd in safety through the narrow seas,\n"+
		"And with his troops doth march amain to London;\n"+
		"And many giddy people flock to him.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Let's levy men, and beat him back again.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"A little fire is quickly trodden out;\n"+
		"Which, being suffer'd, rivers cannot quench.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"In Warwickshire I have true-hearted friends,\n"+
		"Not mutinous in peace, yet bold in war;\n"+
		"Those will I muster up: and thou, son Clarence,\n"+
		"Shalt stir up in Suffolk, Norfolk, and in Kent,\n"+
		"The knights and gentlemen to come with thee:\n"+
		"Thou, brother Montague, in Buckingham,\n"+
		"Northampton and in Leicestershire, shalt find\n"+
		"Men well inclined to hear what thou command'st:\n"+
		"And thou, brave Oxford, wondrous well beloved,\n"+
		"In Oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends.\n"+
		"My sovereign, with the loving citizens,\n"+
		"Like to his island girt in with the ocean,\n"+
		"Or modest Dian circled with her nymphs,\n"+
		"Shall rest in London till we come to him.\n"+
		"Fair lords, take leave and stand not to reply.\n"+
		"Farewell, my sovereign.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Farewell, my Hector, and my Troy's true hope.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"In sign of truth, I kiss your highness' hand.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Well-minded Clarence, be thou fortunate!\n"+
		"MONTAGUE\n"+
		"Comfort, my lord; and so I take my leave.\n"+
		"OXFORD\n"+
		"And thus I seal my truth, and bid adieu.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Sweet Oxford, and my loving Montague,\n"+
		"And all at once, once more a happy farewell.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Farewell, sweet lords: let's meet at Coventry.\n"+
		"Exeunt all but KING HENRY VI and EXETER\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Here at the palace I will rest awhile.\n"+
		"Cousin of Exeter, what thinks your lordship?\n"+
		"Methinks the power that Edward hath in field\n"+
		"Should not be able to encounter mine.\n"+
		"EXETER\n"+
		"The doubt is that he will seduce the rest.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"That's not my fear; my meed hath got me fame:\n"+
		"I have not stopp'd mine ears to their demands,\n"+
		"Nor posted off their suits with slow delays;\n"+
		"My pity hath been balm to heal their wounds,\n"+
		"My mildness hath allay'd their swelling griefs,\n"+
		"My mercy dried their water-flowing tears;\n"+
		"I have not been desirous of their wealth,\n"+
		"Nor much oppress'd them with great subsidies.\n"+
		"Nor forward of revenge, though they much err'd:\n"+
		"Then why should they love Edward more than me?\n"+
		"No, Exeter, these graces challenge grace:\n"+
		"And when the lion fawns upon the lamb,\n"+
		"The lamb will never cease to follow him.\n"+
		"Shout within. 'A Lancaster! A Lancaster!'\n"+
		"EXETER\n"+
		"Hark, hark, my lord! what shouts are these?\n"+
		"Enter KING EDWARD IV, GLOUCESTER, and soldiers\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Seize on the shame-faced Henry, bear him hence;\n"+
		"And once again proclaim us King of England.\n"+
		"You are the fount that makes small brooks to flow:\n"+
		"Now stops thy spring; my sea sha$l suck them dry,\n"+
		"And swell so much the higher by their ebb.\n"+
		"Hence with him to the Tower; let him not speak.\n"+
		"Exeunt some with KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"And, lords, towards Coventry bend we our course\n"+
		"Where peremptory Warwick now remains:\n"+
		"The sun shines hot; and, if we use delay,\n"+
		"Cold biting winter mars our hoped-for hay.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Away betimes, before his forces join,\n"+
		"And take the great-grown traitor unawares:\n"+
		"Brave warriors, march amain towards Coventry.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT V\n"+
		"SCENE I. Coventry.\n"+
		"Enter WARWICK, the Mayor of Coventry, two Messengers, and others upon the walls\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Where is the post that came from valiant Oxford?\n"+
		"How far hence is thy lord, mine honest fellow?\n"+
		"First Messenger\n"+
		"By this at Dunsmore, marching hitherward.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"How far off is our brother Montague?\n"+
		"Where is the post that came from Montague?\n"+
		"Second Messenger\n"+
		"By this at Daintry, with a puissant troop.\n"+
		"Enter SIR JOHN SOMERVILLE\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Say, Somerville, what says my loving son?\n"+
		"And, by thy guess, how nigh is Clarence now?\n"+
		"SOMERSET\n"+
		"At Southam I did leave him with his forces,\n"+
		"And do expect him here some two hours hence.\n"+
		"Drum heard\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Then Clarence is at hand, I hear his drum.\n"+
		"SOMERSET\n"+
		"It is not his, my lord; here Southam lies:\n"+
		"The drum your honour hears marcheth from Warwick.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Who should that be? belike, unlook'd-for friends.\n"+
		"SOMERSET\n"+
		"They are at hand, and you shall quickly know.\n"+
		"March: flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV, GLOUCESTER, and soldiers\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Go, trumpet, to the walls, and sound a parle.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"See how the surly Warwick mans the wall!\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"O unbid spite! is sportful Edward come?\n"+
		"Where slept our scouts, or how are they seduced,\n"+
		"That we could hear no news of his repair?\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Now, Warwick, wilt thou ope the city gates,\n"+
		"Speak gentle words and humbly bend thy knee,\n"+
		"Call Edward king and at his hands beg mercy?\n"+
		"And he shall pardon thee these outrages.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Nay, rather, wilt thou draw thy forces hence,\n"+
		"Confess who set thee up and pluck'd thee own,\n"+
		"Call Warwick patron and be penitent?\n"+
		"And thou shalt still remain the Duke of York.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"I thought, at least, he would have said the king;\n"+
		"Or did he make the jest against his will?\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Is not a dukedom, sir, a goodly gift?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Ay, by my faith, for a poor earl to give:\n"+
		"I'll do thee service for so good a gift.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"'Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Why then 'tis mine, if but by Warwick's gift.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Thou art no Atlas for so great a weight:\n"+
		"And weakling, Warwick takes his gift again;\n"+
		"And Henry is my king, Warwick his subject.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"But Warwick's king is Edward's prisoner:\n"+
		"And, gallant Warwick, do but answer this:\n"+
		"What is the body when the head is off?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Alas, that Warwick had no more forecast,\n"+
		"But, whiles he thought to steal the single ten,\n"+
		"The king was slily finger'd from the deck!\n"+
		"You left poor Henry at the Bishop's palace,\n"+
		"And, ten to one, you'll meet him in the Tower.\n"+
		"EDWARD\n"+
		"'Tis even so; yet you are Warwick still.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Come, Warwick, take the time; kneel down, kneel down:\n"+
		"Nay, when? strike now, or else the iron cools.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"I had rather chop this hand off at a blow,\n"+
		"And with the other fling it at thy face,\n"+
		"Than bear so low a sail, to strike to thee.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Sail how thou canst, have wind and tide thy friend,\n"+
		"This hand, fast wound about thy coal-black hair\n"+
		"Shall, whiles thy head is warm and new cut off,\n"+
		"Write in the dust this sentence with thy blood,\n"+
		"'Wind-changing Warwick now can change no more.'\n"+
		"Enter OXFORD, with drum and colours\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"O cheerful colours! see where Oxford comes!\n"+
		"OXFORD\n"+
		"Oxford, Oxford, for Lancaster!\n"+
		"He and his forces enter the city\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"The gates are open, let us enter too.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"So other foes may set upon our backs.\n"+
		"Stand we in good array; for they no doubt\n"+
		"Will issue out again and bid us battle:\n"+
		"If not, the city being but of small defence,\n"+
		"We'll quickly rouse the traitors in the same.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"O, welcome, Oxford! for we want thy help.\n"+
		"Enter MONTAGUE with drum and colours\n"+
		"MONTAGUE\n"+
		"Montague, Montague, for Lancaster!\n"+
		"He and his forces enter the city\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Thou and thy brother both shall buy this treason\n"+
		"Even with the dearest blood your bodies bear.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"The harder match'd, the greater victory:\n"+
		"My mind presageth happy gain and conquest.\n"+
		"Enter SOMERSET, with drum and colours\n"+
		"SOMERSET\n"+
		"Somerset, Somerset, for Lancaster!\n"+
		"He and his forces enter the city\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Two of thy name, both Dukes of Somerset,\n"+
		"Have sold their lives unto the house of York;\n"+
		"And thou shalt be the third if this sword hold.\n"+
		"Enter CLARENCE, with drum and colours\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"And lo, where George of Clarence sweeps along,\n"+
		"Of force enough to bid his brother battle;\n"+
		"With whom an upright zeal to right prevails\n"+
		"More than the nature of a brother's love!\n"+
		"Come, Clarence, come; thou wilt, if Warwick call.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"Father of Warwick, know you what this means?\n"+
		"Taking his red rose out of his hat\n"+
		"Look here, I throw my infamy at thee\n"+
		"I will not ruinate my father's house,\n"+
		"Who gave his blood to lime the stones together,\n"+
		"And set up Lancaster. Why, trow'st thou, Warwick,\n"+
		"That Clarence is so harsh, so blunt, unnatural,\n"+
		"To bend the fatal instruments of war\n"+
		"Against his brother and his lawful king?\n"+
		"Perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath:\n"+
		"To keep that oath were more impiety\n"+
		"Than Jephthah's, when he sacrificed his daughter.\n"+
		"I am so sorry for my trespass made\n"+
		"That, to deserve well at my brother's hands,\n"+
		"I here proclaim myself thy mortal foe,\n"+
		"With resolution, wheresoe'er I meet thee--\n"+
		"As I will meet thee, if thou stir abroad--\n"+
		"To plague thee for thy foul misleading me.\n"+
		"And so, proud-hearted Warwick, I defy thee,\n"+
		"And to my brother turn my blushing cheeks.\n"+
		"Pardon me, Edward, I will make amends:\n"+
		"And, Richard, do not frown upon my faults,\n"+
		"For I will henceforth be no more unconstant.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Now welcome more, and ten times more beloved,\n"+
		"Than if thou never hadst deserved our hate.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Welcome, good Clarence; this is brotherlike.\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"O passing traitor, perjured and unjust!\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"What, Warwick, wilt thou leave the town and fight?\n"+
		"Or shall we beat the stones about thine ears?\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Alas, I am not coop'd here for defence!\n"+
		"I will away towards Barnet presently,\n"+
		"And bid thee battle, Edward, if thou darest.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Yes, Warwick, Edward dares, and leads the way.\n"+
		"Lords, to the field; Saint George and victory!\n"+
		"Exeunt King Edward and his company. March. Warwick and his company follow\n"+
		"SCENE II. A field of battle near Barnet.\n"+
		"Alarum and excursions. Enter KING EDWARD IV, bringing forth WARWICK wounded\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"So, lie thou there: die thou, and die our fear;\n"+
		"For Warwick was a bug that fear'd us all.\n"+
		"Now, Montague, sit fast; I seek for thee,\n"+
		"That Warwick's bones may keep thine company.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Ah, who is nigh? come to me, friend or foe,\n"+
		"And tell me who is victor, York or Warwick?\n"+
		"Why ask I that? my mangled body shows,\n"+
		"My blood, my want of strength, my sick heart shows.\n"+
		"That I must yield my body to the earth\n"+
		"And, by my fall, the conquest to my foe.\n"+
		"Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge,\n"+
		"Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle,\n"+
		"Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,\n"+
		"Whose top-branch overpeer'd Jove's spreading tree\n"+
		"And kept low shrubs from winter's powerful wind.\n"+
		"These eyes, that now are dimm'd with death's black veil,\n"+
		"Have been as piercing as the mid-day sun,\n"+
		"To search the secret treasons of the world:\n"+
		"The wrinkles in my brows, now filled with blood,\n"+
		"Were liken'd oft to kingly sepulchres;\n"+
		"For who lived king, but I could dig his grave?\n"+
		"And who durst mine when Warwick bent his brow?\n"+
		"Lo, now my glory smear'd in dust and blood!\n"+
		"My parks, my walks, my manors that I had.\n"+
		"Even now forsake me, and of all my lands\n"+
		"Is nothing left me but my body's length.\n"+
		"Why, what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust?\n"+
		"And, live we how we can, yet die we must.\n"+
		"Enter OXFORD and SOMERSET\n"+
		"SOMERSET\n"+
		"Ah, Warwick, Warwick! wert thou as we are.\n"+
		"We might recover all our loss again;\n"+
		"The queen from France hath brought a puissant power:\n"+
		"Even now we heard the news: ah, could'st thou fly!\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Why, then I would not fly. Ah, Montague,\n"+
		"If thou be there, sweet brother, take my hand.\n"+
		"And with thy lips keep in my soul awhile!\n"+
		"Thou lovest me not; for, brother, if thou didst,\n"+
		"Thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood\n"+
		"That glues my lips and will not let me speak.\n"+
		"Come quickly, Montague, or I am dead.\n"+
		"SOMERSET\n"+
		"Ah, Warwick! Montague hath breathed his last;\n"+
		"And to the latest gasp cried out for Warwick,\n"+
		"And said 'Commend me to my valiant brother.'\n"+
		"And more he would have said, and more he spoke,\n"+
		"Which sounded like a clamour in a vault,\n"+
		"That mought not be distinguished; but at last\n"+
		"I well might hear, delivered with a groan,\n"+
		"'O, farewell, Warwick!'\n"+
		"WARWICK\n"+
		"Sweet rest his soul! Fly, lords, and save yourselves;\n"+
		"For Warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven.\n"+
		"Dies\n"+
		"OXFORD\n"+
		"Away, away, to meet the queen's great power!\n"+
		"Here they bear away his body. Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. Another part of the field.\n"+
		"Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV in triumph; with GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, and the rest\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Thus far our fortune keeps an upward course,\n"+
		"And we are graced with wreaths of victory.\n"+
		"But, in the midst of this bright-shining day,\n"+
		"I spy a black, suspicious, threatening cloud,\n"+
		"That will encounter with our glorious sun,\n"+
		"Ere he attain his easeful western bed:\n"+
		"I mean, my lords, those powers that the queen\n"+
		"Hath raised in Gallia have arrived our coast\n"+
		"And, as we hear, march on to fight with us.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"A little gale will soon disperse that cloud\n"+
		"And blow it to the source from whence it came:\n"+
		"The very beams will dry those vapours up,\n"+
		"For every cloud engenders not a storm.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"The queen is valued thirty thousand strong,\n"+
		"And Somerset, with Oxford fled to her:\n"+
		"If she have time to breathe be well assured\n"+
		"Her faction will be full as strong as ours.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"We are advertised by our loving friends\n"+
		"That they do hold their course toward Tewksbury:\n"+
		"We, having now the best at Barnet field,\n"+
		"Will thither straight, for willingness rids way;\n"+
		"And, as we march, our strength will be augmented\n"+
		"In every county as we go along.\n"+
		"Strike up the drum; cry 'Courage!' and away.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV. Plains near Tewksbury.\n"+
		"March. Enter QUEEN MARGARET, PRINCE EDWARD, SOMERSET, OXFORD, and soldiers\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Great lords, wise men ne'er sit and wail their loss,\n"+
		"But cheerly seek how to redress their harms.\n"+
		"What though the mast be now blown overboard,\n"+
		"The cable broke, the holding-anchor lost,\n"+
		"And half our sailors swallow'd in the flood?\n"+
		"Yet lives our pilot still. Is't meet that he\n"+
		"Should leave the helm and like a fearful lad\n"+
		"With tearful eyes add water to the sea\n"+
		"And give more strength to that which hath too much,\n"+
		"Whiles, in his moan, the ship splits on the rock,\n"+
		"Which industry and courage might have saved?\n"+
		"Ah, what a shame! ah, what a fault were this!\n"+
		"Say Warwick was our anchor; what of that?\n"+
		"And Montague our topmost; what of him?\n"+
		"Our slaughter'd friends the tackles; what of these?\n"+
		"Why, is not Oxford here another anchor?\n"+
		"And Somerset another goodly mast?\n"+
		"The friends of France our shrouds and tacklings?\n"+
		"And, though unskilful, why not Ned and I\n"+
		"For once allow'd the skilful pilot's charge?\n"+
		"We will not from the helm to sit and weep,\n"+
		"But keep our course, though the rough wind say no,\n"+
		"From shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck.\n"+
		"As good to chide the waves as speak them fair.\n"+
		"And what is Edward but ruthless sea?\n"+
		"What Clarence but a quicksand of deceit?\n"+
		"And Richard but a ragged fatal rock?\n"+
		"All these the enemies to our poor bark.\n"+
		"Say you can swim; alas, 'tis but a while!\n"+
		"Tread on the sand; why, there you quickly sink:\n"+
		"Bestride the rock; the tide will wash you off,\n"+
		"Or else you famish; that's a threefold death.\n"+
		"This speak I, lords, to let you understand,\n"+
		"If case some one of you would fly from us,\n"+
		"That there's no hoped-for mercy with the brothers\n"+
		"More than with ruthless waves, with sands and rocks.\n"+
		"Why, courage then! what cannot be avoided\n"+
		"'Twere childish weakness to lament or fear.\n"+
		"PRINCE EDWARD\n"+
		"Methinks a woman of this valiant spirit\n"+
		"Should, if a coward heard her speak these words,\n"+
		"Infuse his breast with magnanimity\n"+
		"And make him, naked, foil a man at arms.\n"+
		"I speak not this as doubting any here\n"+
		"For did I but suspect a fearful man\n"+
		"He should have leave to go away betimes,\n"+
		"Lest in our need he might infect another\n"+
		"And make him of like spirit to himself.\n"+
		"If any such be here--as God forbid!--\n"+
		"Let him depart before we need his help.\n"+
		"OXFORD\n"+
		"Women and children of so high a courage,\n"+
		"And warriors faint! why, 'twere perpetual shame.\n"+
		"O brave young prince! thy famous grandfather\n"+
		"Doth live again in thee: long mayst thou live\n"+
		"To bear his image and renew his glories!\n"+
		"SOMERSET\n"+
		"And he that will not fight for such a hope.\n"+
		"Go home to bed, and like the owl by day,\n"+
		"If he arise, be mock'd and wonder'd at.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Thanks, gentle Somerset; sweet Oxford, thanks.\n"+
		"PRINCE EDWARD\n"+
		"And take his thanks that yet hath nothing else.\n"+
		"Enter a Messenger\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Prepare you, lords, for Edward is at hand.\n"+
		"Ready to fight; therefore be resolute.\n"+
		"OXFORD\n"+
		"I thought no less: it is his policy\n"+
		"To haste thus fast, to find us unprovided.\n"+
		"SOMERSET\n"+
		"But he's deceived; we are in readiness.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"This cheers my heart, to see your forwardness.\n"+
		"OXFORD\n"+
		"Here pitch our battle; hence we will not budge.\n"+
		"Flourish and march. Enter KING EDWARD IV, GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, and soldiers\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Brave followers, yonder stands the thorny wood,\n"+
		"Which, by the heavens' assistance and your strength,\n"+
		"Must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night.\n"+
		"I need not add more fuel to your fire,\n"+
		"For well I wot ye blaze to burn them out\n"+
		"Give signal to the fight, and to it, lords!\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Lords, knights, and gentlemen, what I should say\n"+
		"My tears gainsay; for every word I speak,\n"+
		"Ye see, I drink the water of mine eyes.\n"+
		"Therefore, no more but this: Henry, your sovereign,\n"+
		"Is prisoner to the foe; his state usurp'd,\n"+
		"His realm a slaughter-house, his subjects slain,\n"+
		"His statutes cancell'd and his treasure spent;\n"+
		"And yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil.\n"+
		"You fight in justice: then, in God's name, lords,\n"+
		"Be valiant and give signal to the fight.\n"+
		"Alarum. Retreat. Excursions. Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE V. Another part of the field.\n"+
		"Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV, GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, and soldiers; with QUEEN MARGARET, OXFORD, and SOMERSET, prisoners\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Now here a period of tumultuous broils.\n"+
		"Away with Oxford to Hames Castle straight:\n"+
		"For Somerset, off with his guilty head.\n"+
		"Go, bear them hence; I will not hear them speak.\n"+
		"OXFORD\n"+
		"For my part, I'll not trouble thee with words.\n"+
		"SOMERSET\n"+
		"Nor I, but stoop with patience to my fortune.\n"+
		"Exeunt Oxford and Somerset, guarded\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"So part we sadly in this troublous world,\n"+
		"To meet with joy in sweet Jerusalem.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Is proclamation made, that who finds Edward\n"+
		"Shall have a high reward, and he his life?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"It is: and lo, where youthful Edward comes!\n"+
		"Enter soldiers, with PRINCE EDWARD\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Bring forth the gallant, let us hear him speak.\n"+
		"What! can so young a thorn begin to prick?\n"+
		"Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make\n"+
		"For bearing arms, for stirring up my subjects,\n"+
		"And all the trouble thou hast turn'd me to?\n"+
		"PRINCE EDWARD\n"+
		"Speak like a subject, proud ambitious York!\n"+
		"Suppose that I am now my father's mouth;\n"+
		"Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,\n"+
		"Whilst I propose the selfsame words to thee,\n"+
		"Which traitor, thou wouldst have me answer to.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Ah, that thy father had been so resolved!\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"That you might still have worn the petticoat,\n"+
		"And ne'er have stol'n the breech from Lancaster.\n"+
		"PRINCE EDWARD\n"+
		"Let AEsop fable in a winter's night;\n"+
		"His currish riddles sort not with this place.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"By heaven, brat, I'll plague ye for that word.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Ay, thou wast born to be a plague to men.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"For God's sake, take away this captive scold.\n"+
		"PRINCE EDWARD\n"+
		"Nay, take away this scolding crookback rather.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Peace, wilful boy, or I will charm your tongue.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"Untutor'd lad, thou art too malapert.\n"+
		"PRINCE EDWARD\n"+
		"I know my duty; you are all undutiful:\n"+
		"Lascivious Edward, and thou perjured George,\n"+
		"And thou mis-shapen Dick, I tell ye all\n"+
		"I am your better, traitors as ye are:\n"+
		"And thou usurp'st my father's right and mine.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Take that, thou likeness of this railer here.\n"+
		"Stabs him\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Sprawl'st thou? take that, to end thy agony.\n"+
		"Stabs him\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"And there's for twitting me with perjury.\n"+
		"Stabs him\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"O, kill me too!\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Marry, and shall.\n"+
		"Offers to kill her\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Hold, Richard, hold; for we have done too much.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Why should she live, to fill the world with words?\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"What, doth she swoon? use means for her recovery.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Clarence, excuse me to the king my brother;\n"+
		"I'll hence to London on a serious matter:\n"+
		"Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"What? what?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"The Tower, the Tower.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"O Ned, sweet Ned! speak to thy mother, boy!\n"+
		"Canst thou not speak? O traitors! murderers!\n"+
		"They that stabb'd Caesar shed no blood at all,\n"+
		"Did not offend, nor were not worthy blame,\n"+
		"If this foul deed were by to equal it:\n"+
		"He was a man; this, in respect, a child:\n"+
		"And men ne'er spend their fury on a child.\n"+
		"What's worse than murderer, that I may name it?\n"+
		"No, no, my heart will burst, and if I speak:\n"+
		"And I will speak, that so my heart may burst.\n"+
		"Butchers and villains! bloody cannibals!\n"+
		"How sweet a plant have you untimely cropp'd!\n"+
		"You have no children, butchers! if you had,\n"+
		"The thought of them would have stirr'd up remorse:\n"+
		"But if you ever chance to have a child,\n"+
		"Look in his youth to have him so cut off\n"+
		"As, deathmen, you have rid this sweet young prince!\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Away with her; go, bear her hence perforce.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Nay, never bear me hence, dispatch me here,\n"+
		"Here sheathe thy sword, I'll pardon thee my death:\n"+
		"What, wilt thou not? then, Clarence, do it thou.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"By heaven, I will not do thee so much ease.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Good Clarence, do; sweet Clarence, do thou do it.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"Didst thou not hear me swear I would not do it?\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"Ay, but thou usest to forswear thyself:\n"+
		"'Twas sin before, but now 'tis charity.\n"+
		"What, wilt thou not? Where is that devil's butcher,\n"+
		"Hard-favour'd Richard? Richard, where art thou?\n"+
		"Thou art not here: murder is thy alms-deed;\n"+
		"Petitioners for blood thou ne'er put'st back.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Away, I say; I charge ye, bear her hence.\n"+
		"QUEEN MARGARET\n"+
		"So come to you and yours, as to this Prince!\n"+
		"Exit, led out forcibly\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Where's Richard gone?\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"To London, all in post; and, as I guess,\n"+
		"To make a bloody supper in the Tower.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"He's sudden, if a thing comes in his head.\n"+
		"Now march we hence: discharge the common sort\n"+
		"With pay and thanks, and let's away to London\n"+
		"And see our gentle queen how well she fares:\n"+
		"By this, I hope, she hath a son for me.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE VI. London. The Tower.\n"+
		"Enter KING HENRY VI and GLOUCESTER, with the Lieutenant, on the walls\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Good day, my lord. What, at your book so hard?\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Ay, my good lord:--my lord, I should say rather;\n"+
		"'Tis sin to flatter; 'good' was little better:\n"+
		"'Good Gloucester' and 'good devil' were alike,\n"+
		"And both preposterous; therefore, not 'good lord.'\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Sirrah, leave us to ourselves: we must confer.\n"+
		"Exit Lieutenant\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf;\n"+
		"So first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece\n"+
		"And next his throat unto the butcher's knife.\n"+
		"What scene of death hath Roscius now to act?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind;\n"+
		"The thief doth fear each bush an officer.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"The bird that hath been limed in a bush,\n"+
		"With trembling wings misdoubteth every bush;\n"+
		"And I, the hapless male to one sweet bird,\n"+
		"Have now the fatal object in my eye\n"+
		"Where my poor young was limed, was caught and kill'd.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Why, what a peevish fool was that of Crete,\n"+
		"That taught his son the office of a fowl!\n"+
		"An yet, for all his wings, the fool was drown'd.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"I, Daedalus; my poor boy, Icarus;\n"+
		"Thy father, Minos, that denied our course;\n"+
		"The sun that sear'd the wings of my sweet boy\n"+
		"Thy brother Edward, and thyself the sea\n"+
		"Whose envious gulf did swallow up his life.\n"+
		"Ah, kill me with thy weapon, not with words!\n"+
		"My breast can better brook thy dagger's point\n"+
		"Than can my ears that tragic history.\n"+
		"But wherefore dost thou come? is't for my life?\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Think'st thou I am an executioner?\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"A persecutor, I am sure, thou art:\n"+
		"If murdering innocents be executing,\n"+
		"Why, then thou art an executioner.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"Thy son I kill'd for his presumption.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume,\n"+
		"Thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine.\n"+
		"And thus I prophesy, that many a thousand,\n"+
		"Which now mistrust no parcel of my fear,\n"+
		"And many an old man's sigh and many a widow's,\n"+
		"And many an orphan's water-standing eye--\n"+
		"Men for their sons, wives for their husbands,\n"+
		"And orphans for their parents timeless death--\n"+
		"Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born.\n"+
		"The owl shriek'd at thy birth,--an evil sign;\n"+
		"The night-crow cried, aboding luckless time;\n"+
		"Dogs howl'd, and hideous tempest shook down trees;\n"+
		"The raven rook'd her on the chimney's top,\n"+
		"And chattering pies in dismal discords sung.\n"+
		"Thy mother felt more than a mother's pain,\n"+
		"And, yet brought forth less than a mother's hope,\n"+
		"To wit, an indigested and deformed lump,\n"+
		"Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree.\n"+
		"Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born,\n"+
		"To signify thou camest to bite the world:\n"+
		"And, if the rest be true which I have heard,\n"+
		"Thou camest--\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"I'll hear no more: die, prophet in thy speech:\n"+
		"Stabs him\n"+
		"For this amongst the rest, was I ordain'd.\n"+
		"KING HENRY VI\n"+
		"Ay, and for much more slaughter after this.\n"+
		"God forgive my sins, and pardon thee!\n"+
		"Dies\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"What, will the aspiring blood of Lancaster\n"+
		"Sink in the ground? I thought it would have mounted.\n"+
		"See how my sword weeps for the poor king's death!\n"+
		"O, may such purple tears be alway shed\n"+
		"From those that wish the downfall of our house!\n"+
		"If any spark of life be yet remaining,\n"+
		"Down, down to hell; and say I sent thee thither:\n"+
		"Stabs him again\n"+
		"I, that have neither pity, love, nor fear.\n"+
		"Indeed, 'tis true that Henry told me of;\n"+
		"For I have often heard my mother say\n"+
		"I came into the world with my legs forward:\n"+
		"Had I not reason, think ye, to make haste,\n"+
		"And seek their ruin that usurp'd our right?\n"+
		"The midwife wonder'd and the women cried\n"+
		"'O, Jesus bless us, he is born with teeth!'\n"+
		"And so I was; which plainly signified\n"+
		"That I should snarl and bite and play the dog.\n"+
		"Then, since the heavens have shaped my body so,\n"+
		"Let hell make crook'd my mind to answer it.\n"+
		"I have no brother, I am like no brother;\n"+
		"And this word 'love,' which graybeards call divine,\n"+
		"Be resident in men like one another\n"+
		"And not in me: I am myself alone.\n"+
		"Clarence, beware; thou keep'st me from the light:\n"+
		"But I will sort a pitchy day for thee;\n"+
		"For I will buz abroad such prophecies\n"+
		"That Edward shall be fearful of his life,\n"+
		"And then, to purge his fear, I'll be thy death.\n"+
		"King Henry and the prince his son are gone:\n"+
		"Clarence, thy turn is next, and then the rest,\n"+
		"Counting myself but bad till I be best.\n"+
		"I'll throw thy body in another room\n"+
		"And triumph, Henry, in thy day of doom.\n"+
		"Exit, with the body\n"+
		"SCENE VII. London. The palace.\n"+
		"Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV, QUEEN ELIZABETH, CLARENCE, GLOUCESTER, HASTINGS, a Nurse with the young Prince, and Attendants\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Once more we sit in England's royal throne,\n"+
		"Re-purchased with the blood of enemies.\n"+
		"What valiant foemen, like to autumn's corn,\n"+
		"Have we mow'd down, in tops of all their pride!\n"+
		"Three Dukes of Somerset, threefold renown'd\n"+
		"For hardy and undoubted champions;\n"+
		"Two Cliffords, as the father and the son,\n"+
		"And two Northumberlands; two braver men\n"+
		"Ne'er spurr'd their coursers at the trumpet's sound;\n"+
		"With them, the two brave bears, Warwick and Montague,\n"+
		"That in their chains fetter'd the kingly lion\n"+
		"And made the forest tremble when they roar'd.\n"+
		"Thus have we swept suspicion from our seat\n"+
		"And made our footstool of security.\n"+
		"Come hither, Bess, and let me kiss my boy.\n"+
		"Young Ned, for thee, thine uncles and myself\n"+
		"Have in our armours watch'd the winter's night,\n"+
		"Went all afoot in summer's scalding heat,\n"+
		"That thou mightst repossess the crown in peace;\n"+
		"And of our labours thou shalt reap the gain.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"[Aside] I'll blast his harvest, if your head were laid;\n"+
		"For yet I am not look'd on in the world.\n"+
		"This shoulder was ordain'd so thick to heave;\n"+
		"And heave it shall some weight, or break my back:\n"+
		"Work thou the way,--and thou shalt execute.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Clarence and Gloucester, love my lovely queen;\n"+
		"And kiss your princely nephew, brothers both.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"The duty that I owe unto your majesty\n"+
		"I seal upon the lips of this sweet babe.\n"+
		"QUEEN ELIZABETH\n"+
		"Thanks, noble Clarence; worthy brother, thanks.\n"+
		"GLOUCESTER\n"+
		"And, that I love the tree from whence thou sprang'st,\n"+
		"Witness the loving kiss I give the fruit.\n"+
		"Aside\n"+
		"And cried 'all hail!' when as he meant all harm.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Now am I seated as my soul delights,\n"+
		"Having my country's peace and brothers' loves.\n"+
		"CLARENCE\n"+
		"What will your grace have done with Margaret?\n"+
		"Reignier, her father, to the king of France\n"+
		"Hath pawn'd the Sicils and Jerusalem,\n"+
		"And hither have they sent it for her ransom.\n"+
		"KING EDWARD IV\n"+
		"Away with her, and waft her hence to France.\n"+
		"And now what rests but that we spend the time\n"+
		"With stately triumphs, mirthful comic shows,\n"+
		"Such as befits the pleasure of the court?\n"+
		"Sound drums and trumpets! farewell sour annoy!\n"+
		"For here, I hope, begins our lasting joy.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"
