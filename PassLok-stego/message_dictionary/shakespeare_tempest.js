		"The Tempest\n"+
		"ACT I\n"+
		"SCENE I. On a ship at sea: a tempestuous noise\n"+
		"of thunder and lightning heard.\n"+
		"Enter a Master and a Boatswain\n"+
		"Master\n"+
		"Boatswain!\n"+
		"Boatswain\n"+
		"Here, master: what cheer?\n"+
		"Master\n"+
		"Good, speak to the mariners: fall to't, yarely,\n"+
		"or we run ourselves aground: bestir, bestir.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"Enter Mariners\n"+
		"Boatswain\n"+
		"Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!\n"+
		"yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the\n"+
		"master's whistle. Blow, till thou burst thy wind,\n"+
		"if room enough!\n"+
		"Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, FERDINAND, GONZALO, and others\n"+
		"ALONSO\n"+
		"Good boatswain, have care. Where's the master?\n"+
		"Play the men.\n"+
		"Boatswain\n"+
		"I pray now, keep below.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Where is the master, boatswain?\n"+
		"Boatswain\n"+
		"Do you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep your\n"+
		"cabins: you do assist the storm.\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"Nay, good, be patient.\n"+
		"Boatswain\n"+
		"When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers\n"+
		"for the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble us not.\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.\n"+
		"Boatswain\n"+
		"None that I more love than myself. You are a\n"+
		"counsellor; if you can command these elements to\n"+
		"silence, and work the peace of the present, we will\n"+
		"not hand a rope more; use your authority: if you\n"+
		"cannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and make\n"+
		"yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of\n"+
		"the hour, if it so hap. Cheerly, good hearts! Out\n"+
		"of our way, I say.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks he\n"+
		"hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion is\n"+
		"perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his\n"+
		"hanging: make the rope of his destiny our cable,\n"+
		"for our own doth little advantage. If he be not\n"+
		"born to be hanged, our case is miserable.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"Re-enter Boatswain\n"+
		"Boatswain\n"+
		"Down with the topmast! yare! lower, lower! Bring\n"+
		"her to try with main-course.\n"+
		"A cry within\n"+
		"A plague upon this howling! they are louder than\n"+
		"the weather or our office.\n"+
		"Re-enter SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, and GONZALO\n"+
		"Yet again! what do you here? Shall we give o'er\n"+
		"and drown? Have you a mind to sink?\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"A pox o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous,\n"+
		"incharitable dog!\n"+
		"Boatswain\n"+
		"Work you then.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Hang, cur! hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker!\n"+
		"We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"I'll warrant him for drowning; though the ship were\n"+
		"no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an\n"+
		"unstanched wench.\n"+
		"Boatswain\n"+
		"Lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses off to\n"+
		"sea again; lay her off.\n"+
		"Enter Mariners wet\n"+
		"Mariners\n"+
		"All lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost!\n"+
		"Boatswain\n"+
		"What, must our mouths be cold?\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"The king and prince at prayers! let's assist them,\n"+
		"For our case is as theirs.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"I'm out of patience.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards:\n"+
		"This wide-chapp'd rascal--would thou mightst lie drowning\n"+
		"The washing of ten tides!\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"He'll be hang'd yet,\n"+
		"Though every drop of water swear against it\n"+
		"And gape at widest to glut him.\n"+
		"A confused noise within: 'Mercy on us!'-- 'We split, we split!'--'Farewell, my wife and children!'-- 'Farewell, brother!'--'We split, we split, we split!'\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Let's all sink with the king.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"Let's take leave of him.\n"+
		"Exeunt ANTONIO and SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an\n"+
		"acre of barren ground, long heath, brown furze, any\n"+
		"thing. The wills above be done! but I would fain\n"+
		"die a dry death.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. The island. Before PROSPERO'S cell.\n"+
		"Enter PROSPERO and MIRANDA\n"+
		"MIRANDA\n"+
		"If by your art, my dearest father, you have\n"+
		"Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.\n"+
		"The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,\n"+
		"But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek,\n"+
		"Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered\n"+
		"With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel,\n"+
		"Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,\n"+
		"Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knock\n"+
		"Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish'd.\n"+
		"Had I been any god of power, I would\n"+
		"Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere\n"+
		"It should the good ship so have swallow'd and\n"+
		"The fraughting souls within her.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Be collected:\n"+
		"No more amazement: tell your piteous heart\n"+
		"There's no harm done.\n"+
		"MIRANDA\n"+
		"O, woe the day!\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"No harm.\n"+
		"I have done nothing but in care of thee,\n"+
		"Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who\n"+
		"Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing\n"+
		"Of whence I am, nor that I am more better\n"+
		"Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,\n"+
		"And thy no greater father.\n"+
		"MIRANDA\n"+
		"More to know\n"+
		"Did never meddle with my thoughts.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"'Tis time\n"+
		"I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,\n"+
		"And pluck my magic garment from me. So:\n"+
		"Lays down his mantle\n"+
		"Lie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.\n"+
		"The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch'd\n"+
		"The very virtue of compassion in thee,\n"+
		"I have with such provision in mine art\n"+
		"So safely ordered that there is no soul--\n"+
		"No, not so much perdition as an hair\n"+
		"Betid to any creature in the vessel\n"+
		"Which thou heard'st cry, which thou saw'st sink. Sit down;\n"+
		"For thou must now know farther.\n"+
		"MIRANDA\n"+
		"You have often\n"+
		"Begun to tell me what I am, but stopp'd\n"+
		"And left me to a bootless inquisition,\n"+
		"Concluding 'Stay: not yet.'\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"The hour's now come;\n"+
		"The very minute bids thee ope thine ear;\n"+
		"Obey and be attentive. Canst thou remember\n"+
		"A time before we came unto this cell?\n"+
		"I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not\n"+
		"Out three years old.\n"+
		"MIRANDA\n"+
		"Certainly, sir, I can.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"By what? by any other house or person?\n"+
		"Of any thing the image tell me that\n"+
		"Hath kept with thy remembrance.\n"+
		"MIRANDA\n"+
		"'Tis far off\n"+
		"And rather like a dream than an assurance\n"+
		"That my remembrance warrants. Had I not\n"+
		"Four or five women once that tended me?\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it\n"+
		"That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else\n"+
		"In the dark backward and abysm of time?\n"+
		"If thou remember'st aught ere thou camest here,\n"+
		"How thou camest here thou mayst.\n"+
		"MIRANDA\n"+
		"But that I do not.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,\n"+
		"Thy father was the Duke of Milan and\n"+
		"A prince of power.\n"+
		"MIRANDA\n"+
		"Sir, are not you my father?\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and\n"+
		"She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father\n"+
		"Was Duke of Milan; and thou his only heir\n"+
		"And princess no worse issued.\n"+
		"MIRANDA\n"+
		"O the heavens!\n"+
		"What foul play had we, that we came from thence?\n"+
		"Or blessed was't we did?\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Both, both, my girl:\n"+
		"By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heaved thence,\n"+
		"But blessedly holp hither.\n"+
		"MIRANDA\n"+
		"O, my heart bleeds\n"+
		"To think o' the teen that I have turn'd you to,\n"+
		"Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"My brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio--\n"+
		"I pray thee, mark me--that a brother should\n"+
		"Be so perfidious!--he whom next thyself\n"+
		"Of all the world I loved and to him put\n"+
		"The manage of my state; as at that time\n"+
		"Through all the signories it was the first\n"+
		"And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed\n"+
		"In dignity, and for the liberal arts\n"+
		"Without a parallel; those being all my study,\n"+
		"The government I cast upon my brother\n"+
		"And to my state grew stranger, being transported\n"+
		"And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle--\n"+
		"Dost thou attend me?\n"+
		"MIRANDA\n"+
		"Sir, most heedfully.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Being once perfected how to grant suits,\n"+
		"How to deny them, who to advance and who\n"+
		"To trash for over-topping, new created\n"+
		"The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed 'em,\n"+
		"Or else new form'd 'em; having both the key\n"+
		"Of officer and office, set all hearts i' the state\n"+
		"To what tune pleased his ear; that now he was\n"+
		"The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,\n"+
		"And suck'd my verdure out on't. Thou attend'st not.\n"+
		"MIRANDA\n"+
		"O, good sir, I do.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"I pray thee, mark me.\n"+
		"I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated\n"+
		"To closeness and the bettering of my mind\n"+
		"With that which, but by being so retired,\n"+
		"O'er-prized all popular rate, in my false brother\n"+
		"Awaked an evil nature; and my trust,\n"+
		"Like a good parent, did beget of him\n"+
		"A falsehood in its contrary as great\n"+
		"As my trust was; which had indeed no limit,\n"+
		"A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,\n"+
		"Not only with what my revenue yielded,\n"+
		"But what my power might else exact, like one\n"+
		"Who having into truth, by telling of it,\n"+
		"Made such a sinner of his memory,\n"+
		"To credit his own lie, he did believe\n"+
		"He was indeed the duke; out o' the substitution\n"+
		"And executing the outward face of royalty,\n"+
		"With all prerogative: hence his ambition growing--\n"+
		"Dost thou hear?\n"+
		"MIRANDA\n"+
		"Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"To have no screen between this part he play'd\n"+
		"And him he play'd it for, he needs will be\n"+
		"Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library\n"+
		"Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties\n"+
		"He thinks me now incapable; confederates--\n"+
		"So dry he was for sway--wi' the King of Naples\n"+
		"To give him annual tribute, do him homage,\n"+
		"Subject his coronet to his crown and bend\n"+
		"The dukedom yet unbow'd--alas, poor Milan!--\n"+
		"To most ignoble stooping.\n"+
		"MIRANDA\n"+
		"O the heavens!\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Mark his condition and the event; then tell me\n"+
		"If this might be a brother.\n"+
		"MIRANDA\n"+
		"I should sin\n"+
		"To think but nobly of my grandmother:\n"+
		"Good wombs have borne bad sons.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Now the condition.\n"+
		"The King of Naples, being an enemy\n"+
		"To me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit;\n"+
		"Which was, that he, in lieu o' the premises\n"+
		"Of homage and I know not how much tribute,\n"+
		"Should presently extirpate me and mine\n"+
		"Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan\n"+
		"With all the honours on my brother: whereon,\n"+
		"A treacherous army levied, one midnight\n"+
		"Fated to the purpose did Antonio open\n"+
		"The gates of Milan, and, i' the dead of darkness,\n"+
		"The ministers for the purpose hurried thence\n"+
		"Me and thy crying self.\n"+
		"MIRANDA\n"+
		"Alack, for pity!\n"+
		"I, not remembering how I cried out then,\n"+
		"Will cry it o'er again: it is a hint\n"+
		"That wrings mine eyes to't.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Hear a little further\n"+
		"And then I'll bring thee to the present business\n"+
		"Which now's upon's; without the which this story\n"+
		"Were most impertinent.\n"+
		"MIRANDA\n"+
		"Wherefore did they not\n"+
		"That hour destroy us?\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Well demanded, wench:\n"+
		"My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,\n"+
		"So dear the love my people bore me, nor set\n"+
		"A mark so bloody on the business, but\n"+
		"With colours fairer painted their foul ends.\n"+
		"In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,\n"+
		"Bore us some leagues to sea; where they prepared\n"+
		"A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd,\n"+
		"Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats\n"+
		"Instinctively had quit it: there they hoist us,\n"+
		"To cry to the sea that roar'd to us, to sigh\n"+
		"To the winds whose pity, sighing back again,\n"+
		"Did us but loving wrong.\n"+
		"MIRANDA\n"+
		"Alack, what trouble\n"+
		"Was I then to you!\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"O, a cherubim\n"+
		"Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile.\n"+
		"Infused with a fortitude from heaven,\n"+
		"When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt,\n"+
		"Under my burthen groan'd; which raised in me\n"+
		"An undergoing stomach, to bear up\n"+
		"Against what should ensue.\n"+
		"MIRANDA\n"+
		"How came we ashore?\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"By Providence divine.\n"+
		"Some food we had and some fresh water that\n"+
		"A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,\n"+
		"Out of his charity, being then appointed\n"+
		"Master of this design, did give us, with\n"+
		"Rich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries,\n"+
		"Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness,\n"+
		"Knowing I loved my books, he furnish'd me\n"+
		"From mine own library with volumes that\n"+
		"I prize above my dukedom.\n"+
		"MIRANDA\n"+
		"Would I might\n"+
		"But ever see that man!\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Now I arise:\n"+
		"Resumes his mantle\n"+
		"Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.\n"+
		"Here in this island we arrived; and here\n"+
		"Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit\n"+
		"Than other princesses can that have more time\n"+
		"For vainer hours and tutors not so careful.\n"+
		"MIRANDA\n"+
		"Heavens thank you for't! And now, I pray you, sir,\n"+
		"For still 'tis beating in my mind, your reason\n"+
		"For raising this sea-storm?\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Know thus far forth.\n"+
		"By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,\n"+
		"Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies\n"+
		"Brought to this shore; and by my prescience\n"+
		"I find my zenith doth depend upon\n"+
		"A most auspicious star, whose influence\n"+
		"If now I court not but omit, my fortunes\n"+
		"Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions:\n"+
		"Thou art inclined to sleep; 'tis a good dulness,\n"+
		"And give it way: I know thou canst not choose.\n"+
		"MIRANDA sleeps\n"+
		"Come away, servant, come. I am ready now.\n"+
		"Approach, my Ariel, come.\n"+
		"Enter ARIEL\n"+
		"ARIEL\n"+
		"All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come\n"+
		"To answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly,\n"+
		"To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride\n"+
		"On the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding task\n"+
		"Ariel and all his quality.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Hast thou, spirit,\n"+
		"Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee?\n"+
		"ARIEL\n"+
		"To every article.\n"+
		"I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak,\n"+
		"Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,\n"+
		"I flamed amazement: sometime I'ld divide,\n"+
		"And burn in many places; on the topmast,\n"+
		"The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,\n"+
		"Then meet and join. Jove's lightnings, the precursors\n"+
		"O' the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary\n"+
		"And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks\n"+
		"Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune\n"+
		"Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,\n"+
		"Yea, his dread trident shake.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"My brave spirit!\n"+
		"Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil\n"+
		"Would not infect his reason?\n"+
		"ARIEL\n"+
		"Not a soul\n"+
		"But felt a fever of the mad and play'd\n"+
		"Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners\n"+
		"Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,\n"+
		"Then all afire with me: the king's son, Ferdinand,\n"+
		"With hair up-staring,--then like reeds, not hair,--\n"+
		"Was the first man that leap'd; cried, 'Hell is empty\n"+
		"And all the devils are here.'\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Why that's my spirit!\n"+
		"But was not this nigh shore?\n"+
		"ARIEL\n"+
		"Close by, my master.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"But are they, Ariel, safe?\n"+
		"ARIEL\n"+
		"Not a hair perish'd;\n"+
		"On their sustaining garments not a blemish,\n"+
		"But fresher than before: and, as thou badest me,\n"+
		"In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle.\n"+
		"The king's son have I landed by himself;\n"+
		"Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs\n"+
		"In an odd angle of the isle and sitting,\n"+
		"His arms in this sad knot.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Of the king's ship\n"+
		"The mariners say how thou hast disposed\n"+
		"And all the rest o' the fleet.\n"+
		"ARIEL\n"+
		"Safely in harbour\n"+
		"Is the king's ship; in the deep nook, where once\n"+
		"Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew\n"+
		"From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid:\n"+
		"The mariners all under hatches stow'd;\n"+
		"Who, with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour,\n"+
		"I have left asleep; and for the rest o' the fleet\n"+
		"Which I dispersed, they all have met again\n"+
		"And are upon the Mediterranean flote,\n"+
		"Bound sadly home for Naples,\n"+
		"Supposing that they saw the king's ship wreck'd\n"+
		"And his great person perish.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Ariel, thy charge\n"+
		"Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.\n"+
		"What is the time o' the day?\n"+
		"ARIEL\n"+
		"Past the mid season.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"At least two glasses. The time 'twixt six and now\n"+
		"Must by us both be spent most preciously.\n"+
		"ARIEL\n"+
		"Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,\n"+
		"Let me remember thee what thou hast promised,\n"+
		"Which is not yet perform'd me.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"How now? moody?\n"+
		"What is't thou canst demand?\n"+
		"ARIEL\n"+
		"My liberty.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Before the time be out? no more!\n"+
		"ARIEL\n"+
		"I prithee,\n"+
		"Remember I have done thee worthy service;\n"+
		"Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, served\n"+
		"Without or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise\n"+
		"To bate me a full year.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Dost thou forget\n"+
		"From what a torment I did free thee?\n"+
		"ARIEL\n"+
		"No.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Thou dost, and think'st it much to tread the ooze\n"+
		"Of the salt deep,\n"+
		"To run upon the sharp wind of the north,\n"+
		"To do me business in the veins o' the earth\n"+
		"When it is baked with frost.\n"+
		"ARIEL\n"+
		"I do not, sir.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot\n"+
		"The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy\n"+
		"Was grown into a hoop? hast thou forgot her?\n"+
		"ARIEL\n"+
		"No, sir.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Thou hast. Where was she born? speak; tell me.\n"+
		"ARIEL\n"+
		"Sir, in Argier.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"O, was she so? I must\n"+
		"Once in a month recount what thou hast been,\n"+
		"Which thou forget'st. This damn'd witch Sycorax,\n"+
		"For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible\n"+
		"To enter human hearing, from Argier,\n"+
		"Thou know'st, was banish'd: for one thing she did\n"+
		"They would not take her life. Is not this true?\n"+
		"ARIEL\n"+
		"Ay, sir.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child\n"+
		"And here was left by the sailors. Thou, my slave,\n"+
		"As thou report'st thyself, wast then her servant;\n"+
		"And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate\n"+
		"To act her earthy and abhorr'd commands,\n"+
		"Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,\n"+
		"By help of her more potent ministers\n"+
		"And in her most unmitigable rage,\n"+
		"Into a cloven pine; within which rift\n"+
		"Imprison'd thou didst painfully remain\n"+
		"A dozen years; within which space she died\n"+
		"And left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groans\n"+
		"As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island--\n"+
		"Save for the son that she did litter here,\n"+
		"A freckled whelp hag-born--not honour'd with\n"+
		"A human shape.\n"+
		"ARIEL\n"+
		"Yes, Caliban her son.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban\n"+
		"Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know'st\n"+
		"What torment I did find thee in; thy groans\n"+
		"Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts\n"+
		"Of ever angry bears: it was a torment\n"+
		"To lay upon the damn'd, which Sycorax\n"+
		"Could not again undo: it was mine art,\n"+
		"When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape\n"+
		"The pine and let thee out.\n"+
		"ARIEL\n"+
		"I thank thee, master.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oak\n"+
		"And peg thee in his knotty entrails till\n"+
		"Thou hast howl'd away twelve winters.\n"+
		"ARIEL\n"+
		"Pardon, master;\n"+
		"I will be correspondent to command\n"+
		"And do my spiriting gently.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Do so, and after two days\n"+
		"I will discharge thee.\n"+
		"ARIEL\n"+
		"That's my noble master!\n"+
		"What shall I do? say what; what shall I do?\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Go make thyself like a nymph o' the sea: be subject\n"+
		"To no sight but thine and mine, invisible\n"+
		"To every eyeball else. Go take this shape\n"+
		"And hither come in't: go, hence with diligence!\n"+
		"Exit ARIEL\n"+
		"Awake, dear heart, awake! thou hast slept well; Awake!\n"+
		"MIRANDA\n"+
		"The strangeness of your story put\n"+
		"Heaviness in me.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Shake it off. Come on;\n"+

		"Thou earth, thou! speak.\n"+
		"CALIBAN\n"+
		"[Within] There's wood enough within.\n"+

		"As wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'd\n"+
		"With raven's feather from unwholesome fen\n"+
		"Drop on you both! a south-west blow on ye\n"+

		"Shall, for that vast of night that they may work,\n"+
		"All exercise on thee; thou shalt be pinch'd\n"+
		"As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging\n"+
		"Than bees that made 'em.\n"+
		"CALIBAN\n"+
		"I must eat my dinner.\n"+
		"This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother,\n"+
		"Which thou takest from me. When thou camest first,\n"+

		"Water with berries in't, and teach me how\n"+
		"To name the bigger light, and how the less,\n"+
		"That burn by day and night: and then I loved thee\n"+
		"And show'd thee all the qualities o' the isle,\n"+
		"The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile:\n"+
		"Cursed be I that did so! All the charms\n"+
		"Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!\n"+
		"For I am all the subjects that you have,\n"+
		"Which first was mine own king: and here you sty me\n"+

		"The rest o' the island.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Thou most lying slave,\n"+
		"Whom stripes may move, not kindness! I have used thee,\n"+

		"Aside\n"+

		"Cry, Cock-a-diddle-dow.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"Where should this music be? i' the air or the earth?\n"+
		"It sounds no more: and sure, it waits upon\n"+
		"Some god o' the island. Sitting on a bank,\n"+
		"Weeping again the king my father's wreck,\n"+
		"This music crept by me upon the waters,\n"+
		"Allaying both their fury and my passion\n"+

		"It carries a brave form. But 'tis a spirit.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"No, wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such senses\n"+
		"As we have, such. This gallant which thou seest\n"+
		"Was in the wreck; and, but he's something stain'd\n"+
		"With grief that's beauty's canker, thou mightst call him\n"+
		"A goodly person: he hath lost his fellows\n"+
		"And strays about to find 'em.\n"+
		"MIRANDA\n"+
		"I might call him\n"+
		"A thing divine, for nothing natural\n"+
		"I ever saw so noble.\n"+

		"Most sure, the goddess\n"+
		"On whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe my prayer\n"+
		"May know if you remain upon this island;\n"+
		"And that you will some good instruction give\n"+
		"How I may bear me here: my prime request,\n"+
		"Which I do last pronounce, is, O you wonder!\n"+
		"If you be maid or no?\n"+
		"MIRANDA\n"+
		"No wonder, sir;\n"+
		"But certainly a maid.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"My language! heavens!\n"+
		"I am the best of them that speak this speech,\n"+
		"Were I but where 'tis spoken.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"How? the best?\n"+
		"What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee?\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"A single thing, as I am now, that wonders\n"+
		"To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me;\n"+
		"And that he does I weep: myself am Naples,\n"+
		"Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld\n"+
		"The king my father wreck'd.\n"+
		"MIRANDA\n"+
		"Alack, for mercy!\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"Yes, faith, and all his lords; the Duke of Milan\n"+
		"And his brave son being twain.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"[Aside] The Duke of Milan\n"+
		"And his more braver daughter could control thee,\n"+
		"If now 'twere fit to do't. At the first sight\n"+
		"They have changed eyes. Delicate Ariel,\n"+
		"I'll set thee free for this.\n"+
		"To FERDINAND\n"+
		"A word, good sir;\n"+
		"I fear you have done yourself some wrong: a word.\n"+
		"MIRANDA\n"+
		"Why speaks my father so ungently? This\n"+
		"Is the third man that e'er I saw, the first\n"+
		"That e'er I sigh'd for: pity move my father\n"+
		"To be inclined my way!\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"O, if a virgin,\n"+
		"And your affection not gone forth, I'll make you\n"+
		"The queen of Naples.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Soft, sir! one word more.\n"+
		"Aside\n"+
		"They are both in either's powers; but this swift business\n"+
		"I must uneasy make, lest too light winning\n"+
		"Make the prize light.\n"+
		"To FERDINAND\n"+
		"One word more; I charge thee\n"+
		"That thou attend me: thou dost here usurp\n"+
		"The name thou owest not; and hast put thyself\n"+
		"Upon this island as a spy, to win it\n"+
		"From me, the lord on't.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"No, as I am a man.\n"+
		"MIRANDA\n"+
		"There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple:\n"+
		"If the ill spirit have so fair a house,\n"+
		"Good things will strive to dwell with't.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Follow me.\n"+
		"Speak not you for him; he's a traitor. Come;\n"+
		"I'll manacle thy neck and feet together:\n"+
		"Sea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall be\n"+
		"The fresh-brook muscles, wither'd roots and husks\n"+
		"Wherein the acorn cradled. Follow.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"No;\n"+
		"I will resist such entertainment till\n"+
		"Mine enemy has more power.\n"+
		"Draws, and is charmed from moving\n"+
		"MIRANDA\n"+
		"O dear father,\n"+
		"Make not too rash a trial of him, for\n"+
		"He's gentle and not fearful.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"What? I say,\n"+
		"My foot my tutor? Put thy sword up, traitor;\n"+
		"Who makest a show but darest not strike, thy conscience\n"+
		"Is so possess'd with guilt: come from thy ward,\n"+
		"For I can here disarm thee with this stick\n"+
		"And make thy weapon drop.\n"+
		"MIRANDA\n"+
		"Beseech you, father.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Hence! hang not on my garments.\n"+
		"MIRANDA\n"+
		"Sir, have pity;\n"+
		"I'll be his surety.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Silence! one word more\n"+
		"Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What!\n"+
		"An advocate for an imposter! hush!\n"+
		"Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he,\n"+
		"Having seen but him and Caliban: foolish wench!\n"+
		"To the most of men this is a Caliban\n"+
		"And they to him are angels.\n"+
		"MIRANDA\n"+
		"My affections\n"+
		"Are then most humble; I have no ambition\n"+
		"To see a goodlier man.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Come on; obey:\n"+
		"Thy nerves are in their infancy again\n"+
		"And have no vigour in them.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"So they are;\n"+
		"My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.\n"+
		"My father's loss, the weakness which I feel,\n"+
		"The wreck of all my friends, nor this man's threats,\n"+
		"To whom I am subdued, are but light to me,\n"+
		"Might I but through my prison once a day\n"+
		"Behold this maid: all corners else o' the earth\n"+
		"Let liberty make use of; space enough\n"+
		"Have I in such a prison.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"[Aside] It works.\n"+
		"To FERDINAND\n"+
		"Come on.\n"+
		"Thou hast done well, fine Ariel!\n"+
		"To FERDINAND\n"+
		"Follow me.\n"+
		"To ARIEL\n"+
		"Hark what thou else shalt do me.\n"+
		"MIRANDA\n"+
		"Be of comfort;\n"+
		"My father's of a better nature, sir,\n"+
		"Than he appears by speech: this is unwonted\n"+
		"Which now came from him.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Thou shalt be free\n"+
		"As mountain winds: but then exactly do\n"+
		"All points of my command.\n"+
		"ARIEL\n"+
		"To the syllable.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Come, follow. Speak not for him.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT II\n"+
		"SCENE I. Another part of the island.\n"+
		"Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO, ADRIAN, FRANCISCO, and others\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause,\n"+
		"So have we all, of joy; for our escape\n"+
		"Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe\n"+
		"Is common; every day some sailor's wife,\n"+
		"The masters of some merchant and the merchant\n"+
		"Have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,\n"+
		"I mean our preservation, few in millions\n"+
		"Can speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weigh\n"+
		"Our sorrow with our comfort.\n"+
		"ALONSO\n"+
		"Prithee, peace.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"He receives comfort like cold porridge.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"The visitor will not give him o'er so.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"Look he's winding up the watch of his wit;\n"+
		"by and by it will strike.\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"Sir,--\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"One: tell.\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"When every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd,\n"+
		"Comes to the entertainer--\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"A dollar.\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"Dolour comes to him, indeed: you\n"+
		"have spoken truer than you purposed.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should.\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"Therefore, my lord,--\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!\n"+
		"ALONSO\n"+
		"I prithee, spare.\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"Well, I have done: but yet,--\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"He will be talking.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Which, of he or Adrian, for a good\n"+
		"wager, first begins to crow?\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"The old cock.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"The cockerel.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"Done. The wager?\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"A laughter.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"A match!\n"+
		"ADRIAN\n"+
		"Though this island seem to be desert,--\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"Ha, ha, ha! So, you're paid.\n"+
		"ADRIAN\n"+
		"Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible,--\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"Yet,--\n"+
		"ADRIAN\n"+
		"Yet,--\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"He could not miss't.\n"+
		"ADRIAN\n"+
		"It must needs be of subtle, tender and delicate\n"+
		"temperance.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Temperance was a delicate wench.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly delivered.\n"+
		"ADRIAN\n"+
		"The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"As if it had lungs and rotten ones.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Or as 'twere perfumed by a fen.\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"Here is everything advantageous to life.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"True; save means to live.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"Of that there's none, or little.\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"The ground indeed is tawny.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"With an eye of green in't.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"He misses not much.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"No; he doth but mistake the truth totally.\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"But the rarity of it is,--which is indeed almost\n"+
		"beyond credit,--\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"As many vouched rarities are.\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"That our garments, being, as they were, drenched in\n"+
		"the sea, hold notwithstanding their freshness and\n"+
		"glosses, being rather new-dyed than stained with\n"+
		"salt water.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"If but one of his pockets could speak, would it not\n"+
		"say he lies?\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we\n"+
		"put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of\n"+
		"the king's fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return.\n"+
		"ADRIAN\n"+
		"Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to\n"+
		"their queen.\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"Not since widow Dido's time.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Widow! a pox o' that! How came that widow in?\n"+
		"widow Dido!\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"What if he had said 'widower AEneas' too? Good Lord,\n"+
		"how you take it!\n"+
		"ADRIAN\n"+
		"'Widow Dido' said you? you make me study of that:\n"+
		"she was of Carthage, not of Tunis.\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.\n"+
		"ADRIAN\n"+
		"Carthage?\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"I assure you, Carthage.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"His word is more than the miraculous harp; he hath\n"+
		"raised the wall and houses too.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"What impossible matter will he make easy next?\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"I think he will carry this island home in his pocket\n"+
		"and give it his son for an apple.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring\n"+
		"forth more islands.\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"Ay.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Why, in good time.\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now\n"+
		"as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage\n"+
		"of your daughter, who is now queen.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"And the rarest that e'er came there.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"O, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido.\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I\n"+
		"wore it? I mean, in a sort.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"That sort was well fished for.\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"When I wore it at your daughter's marriage?\n"+
		"ALONSO\n"+
		"You cram these words into mine ears against\n"+
		"The stomach of my sense. Would I had never\n"+
		"Married my daughter there! for, coming thence,\n"+
		"My son is lost and, in my rate, she too,\n"+
		"Who is so far from Italy removed\n"+
		"I ne'er again shall see her. O thou mine heir\n"+
		"Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish\n"+
		"Hath made his meal on thee?\n"+
		"FRANCISCO\n"+
		"Sir, he may live:\n"+
		"I saw him beat the surges under him,\n"+
		"And ride upon their backs; he trod the water,\n"+
		"Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted\n"+
		"The surge most swoln that met him; his bold head\n"+
		"'Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar'd\n"+
		"Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke\n"+
		"To the shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd,\n"+
		"As stooping to relieve him: I not doubt\n"+
		"He came alive to land.\n"+
		"ALONSO\n"+
		"No, no, he's gone.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,\n"+
		"That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,\n"+
		"But rather lose her to an African;\n"+
		"Where she at least is banish'd from your eye,\n"+
		"Who hath cause to wet the grief on't.\n"+
		"ALONSO\n"+
		"Prithee, peace.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"You were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise\n"+
		"By all of us, and the fair soul herself\n"+
		"Weigh'd between loathness and obedience, at\n"+
		"Which end o' the beam should bow. We have lost your\n"+
		"son,\n"+
		"I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have\n"+
		"More widows in them of this business' making\n"+
		"Than we bring men to comfort them:\n"+
		"The fault's your own.\n"+
		"ALONSO\n"+
		"So is the dear'st o' the loss.\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"My lord Sebastian,\n"+
		"The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness\n"+
		"And time to speak it in: you rub the sore,\n"+
		"When you should bring the plaster.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"Very well.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"And most chirurgeonly.\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"It is foul weather in us all, good sir,\n"+
		"When you are cloudy.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"Foul weather?\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Very foul.\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"Had I plantation of this isle, my lord,--\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"He'ld sow't with nettle-seed.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"Or docks, or mallows.\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"And were the king on't, what would I do?\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"'Scape being drunk for want of wine.\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"I' the commonwealth I would by contraries\n"+
		"Execute all things; for no kind of traffic\n"+
		"Would I admit; no name of magistrate;\n"+
		"Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,\n"+
		"And use of service, none; contract, succession,\n"+
		"Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;\n"+
		"No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;\n"+
		"No occupation; all men idle, all;\n"+
		"And women too, but innocent and pure;\n"+
		"No sovereignty;--\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"Yet he would be king on't.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the\n"+
		"beginning.\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"All things in common nature should produce\n"+
		"Without sweat or endeavour: treason, felony,\n"+
		"Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,\n"+
		"Would I not have; but nature should bring forth,\n"+
		"Of its own kind, all foison, all abundance,\n"+
		"To feed my innocent people.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"No marrying 'mong his subjects?\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"None, man; all idle: whores and knaves.\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"I would with such perfection govern, sir,\n"+
		"To excel the golden age.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"God save his majesty!\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Long live Gonzalo!\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"And,--do you mark me, sir?\n"+
		"ALONSO\n"+
		"Prithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me.\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"I do well believe your highness; and\n"+
		"did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen,\n"+
		"who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that\n"+
		"they always use to laugh at nothing.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"'Twas you we laughed at.\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing\n"+
		"to you: so you may continue and laugh at\n"+
		"nothing still.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"What a blow was there given!\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"An it had not fallen flat-long.\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"You are gentlemen of brave metal; you would lift\n"+
		"the moon out of her sphere, if she would continue\n"+
		"in it five weeks without changing.\n"+
		"Enter ARIEL, invisible, playing solemn music\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"We would so, and then go a bat-fowling.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Nay, good my lord, be not angry.\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"No, I warrant you; I will not adventure\n"+
		"my discretion so weakly. Will you laugh\n"+
		"me asleep, for I am very heavy?\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Go sleep, and hear us.\n"+
		"All sleep except ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, and ANTONIO\n"+
		"ALONSO\n"+
		"What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes\n"+
		"Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find\n"+
		"They are inclined to do so.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"Please you, sir,\n"+
		"Do not omit the heavy offer of it:\n"+
		"It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,\n"+
		"It is a comforter.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"We two, my lord,\n"+
		"Will guard your person while you take your rest,\n"+
		"And watch your safety.\n"+
		"ALONSO\n"+
		"Thank you. Wondrous heavy.\n"+
		"ALONSO sleeps. Exit ARIEL\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"What a strange drowsiness possesses them!\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"It is the quality o' the climate.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"Why\n"+
		"Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not\n"+
		"Myself disposed to sleep.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Nor I; my spirits are nimble.\n"+
		"They fell together all, as by consent;\n"+
		"They dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,\n"+
		"Worthy Sebastian? O, what might?--No more:--\n"+
		"And yet me thinks I see it in thy face,\n"+
		"What thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee, and\n"+
		"My strong imagination sees a crown\n"+
		"Dropping upon thy head.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"What, art thou waking?\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Do you not hear me speak?\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"I do; and surely\n"+
		"It is a sleepy language and thou speak'st\n"+
		"Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?\n"+
		"This is a strange repose, to be asleep\n"+
		"With eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving,\n"+
		"And yet so fast asleep.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Noble Sebastian,\n"+
		"Thou let'st thy fortune sleep--die, rather; wink'st\n"+
		"Whiles thou art waking.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"Thou dost snore distinctly;\n"+
		"There's meaning in thy snores.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"I am more serious than my custom: you\n"+
		"Must be so too, if heed me; which to do\n"+
		"Trebles thee o'er.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"Well, I am standing water.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"I'll teach you how to flow.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"Do so: to ebb\n"+
		"Hereditary sloth instructs me.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"O,\n"+
		"If you but knew how you the purpose cherish\n"+
		"Whiles thus you mock it! how, in stripping it,\n"+
		"You more invest it! Ebbing men, indeed,\n"+
		"Most often do so near the bottom run\n"+
		"By their own fear or sloth.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"Prithee, say on:\n"+
		"The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim\n"+
		"A matter from thee, and a birth indeed\n"+
		"Which throes thee much to yield.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Thus, sir:\n"+
		"Although this lord of weak remembrance, this,\n"+
		"Who shall be of as little memory\n"+
		"When he is earth'd, hath here almost persuade,--\n"+
		"For he's a spirit of persuasion, only\n"+
		"Professes to persuade,--the king his son's alive,\n"+
		"'Tis as impossible that he's undrown'd\n"+
		"And he that sleeps here swims.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"I have no hope\n"+
		"That he's undrown'd.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"O, out of that 'no hope'\n"+
		"What great hope have you! no hope that way is\n"+
		"Another way so high a hope that even\n"+
		"Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,\n"+
		"But doubt discovery there. Will you grant with me\n"+
		"That Ferdinand is drown'd?\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"He's gone.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Then, tell me,\n"+
		"Who's the next heir of Naples?\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"Claribel.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"She that is queen of Tunis; she that dwells\n"+
		"Ten leagues beyond man's life; she that from Naples\n"+
		"Can have no note, unless the sun were post--\n"+
		"The man i' the moon's too slow--till new-born chins\n"+
		"Be rough and razorable; she that--from whom?\n"+
		"We all were sea-swallow'd, though some cast again,\n"+
		"And by that destiny to perform an act\n"+
		"Whereof what's past is prologue, what to come\n"+
		"In yours and my discharge.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"What stuff is this! how say you?\n"+
		"'Tis true, my brother's daughter's queen of Tunis;\n"+
		"So is she heir of Naples; 'twixt which regions\n"+
		"There is some space.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"A space whose every cubit\n"+
		"Seems to cry out, 'How shall that Claribel\n"+
		"Measure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis,\n"+
		"And let Sebastian wake.' Say, this were death\n"+
		"That now hath seized them; why, they were no worse\n"+
		"Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples\n"+
		"As well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate\n"+
		"As amply and unnecessarily\n"+
		"As this Gonzalo; I myself could make\n"+
		"A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore\n"+
		"The mind that I do! what a sleep were this\n"+
		"For your advancement! Do you understand me?\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"Methinks I do.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"And how does your content\n"+
		"Tender your own good fortune?\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"I remember\n"+
		"You did supplant your brother Prospero.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"True:\n"+
		"And look how well my garments sit upon me;\n"+
		"Much feater than before: my brother's servants\n"+
		"Were then my fellows; now they are my men.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"But, for your conscience?\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Ay, sir; where lies that? if 'twere a kibe,\n"+
		"'Twould put me to my slipper: but I feel not\n"+
		"This deity in my bosom: twenty consciences,\n"+
		"That stand 'twixt me and Milan, candied be they\n"+
		"And melt ere they molest! Here lies your brother,\n"+
		"No better than the earth he lies upon,\n"+
		"If he were that which now he's like, that's dead;\n"+
		"Whom I, with this obedient steel, three inches of it,\n"+
		"Can lay to bed for ever; whiles you, doing thus,\n"+
		"To the perpetual wink for aye might put\n"+
		"This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who\n"+
		"Should not upbraid our course. For all the rest,\n"+
		"They'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk;\n"+
		"They'll tell the clock to any business that\n"+
		"We say befits the hour.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"Thy case, dear friend,\n"+
		"Shall be my precedent; as thou got'st Milan,\n"+
		"I'll come by Naples. Draw thy sword: one stroke\n"+
		"Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest;\n"+
		"And I the king shall love thee.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Draw together;\n"+
		"And when I rear my hand, do you the like,\n"+
		"To fall it on Gonzalo.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"O, but one word.\n"+
		"They talk apart\n"+
		"Re-enter ARIEL, invisible\n"+
		"ARIEL\n"+
		"My master through his art foresees the danger\n"+
		"That you, his friend, are in; and sends me forth--\n"+
		"For else his project dies--to keep them living.\n"+
		"Sings in GONZALO's ear\n"+
		"While you here do snoring lie,\n"+
		"Open-eyed conspiracy\n"+
		"His time doth take.\n"+
		"If of life you keep a care,\n"+
		"Shake off slumber, and beware:\n"+
		"Awake, awake!\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Then let us both be sudden.\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"Now, good angels\n"+
		"Preserve the king.\n"+
		"They wake\n"+
		"ALONSO\n"+
		"Why, how now? ho, awake! Why are you drawn?\n"+
		"Wherefore this ghastly looking?\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"What's the matter?\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"Whiles we stood here securing your repose,\n"+
		"Even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing\n"+
		"Like bulls, or rather lions: did't not wake you?\n"+
		"It struck mine ear most terribly.\n"+
		"ALONSO\n"+
		"I heard nothing.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"O, 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear,\n"+
		"To make an earthquake! sure, it was the roar\n"+
		"Of a whole herd of lions.\n"+
		"ALONSO\n"+
		"Heard you this, Gonzalo?\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"Upon mine honour, sir, I heard a humming,\n"+
		"And that a strange one too, which did awake me:\n"+
		"I shaked you, sir, and cried: as mine eyes open'd,\n"+
		"I saw their weapons drawn: there was a noise,\n"+
		"That's verily. 'Tis best we stand upon our guard,\n"+
		"Or that we quit this place; let's draw our weapons.\n"+
		"ALONSO\n"+
		"Lead off this ground; and let's make further search\n"+
		"For my poor son.\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"Heavens keep him from these beasts!\n"+
		"For he is, sure, i' the island.\n"+
		"ALONSO\n"+
		"Lead away.\n"+
		"ARIEL\n"+
		"Prospero my lord shall know what I have done:\n"+
		"So, king, go safely on to seek thy son.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. Another part of the island.\n"+
		"Enter CALIBAN with a burden of wood. A noise of thunder heard\n"+
		"CALIBAN\n"+
		"All the infections that the sun sucks up\n"+
		"From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall and make him\n"+
		"By inch-meal a disease! His spirits hear me\n"+
		"And yet I needs must curse. But they'll nor pinch,\n"+
		"Fright me with urchin--shows, pitch me i' the mire,\n"+
		"Nor lead me, like a firebrand, in the dark\n"+
		"Out of my way, unless he bid 'em; but\n"+
		"For every trifle are they set upon me;\n"+
		"Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me\n"+
		"And after bite me, then like hedgehogs which\n"+
		"Lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount\n"+
		"Their pricks at my footfall; sometime am I\n"+
		"All wound with adders who with cloven tongues\n"+
		"Do hiss me into madness.\n"+
		"Enter TRINCULO\n"+
		"Lo, now, lo!\n"+
		"Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me\n"+
		"For bringing wood in slowly. I'll fall flat;\n"+
		"Perchance he will not mind me.\n"+
		"TRINCULO\n"+
		"Here's neither bush nor shrub, to bear off\n"+
		"any weather at all, and another storm brewing;\n"+
		"I hear it sing i' the wind: yond same black\n"+
		"cloud, yond huge one, looks like a foul\n"+
		"bombard that would shed his liquor. If it\n"+
		"should thunder as it did before, I know not\n"+
		"where to hide my head: yond same cloud cannot\n"+
		"choose but fall by pailfuls. What have we\n"+
		"here? a man or a fish? dead or alive? A fish:\n"+
		"he smells like a fish; a very ancient and fish-\n"+
		"like smell; a kind of not of the newest Poor-\n"+
		"John. A strange fish! Were I in England now,\n"+
		"as once I was, and had but this fish painted,\n"+
		"not a holiday fool there but would give a piece\n"+
		"of silver: there would this monster make a\n"+
		"man; any strange beast there makes a man:\n"+
		"when they will not give a doit to relieve a lame\n"+
		"beggar, they will lazy out ten to see a dead\n"+
		"Indian. Legged like a man and his fins like\n"+
		"arms! Warm o' my troth! I do now let loose\n"+
		"my opinion; hold it no longer: this is no fish,\n"+
		"but an islander, that hath lately suffered by a\n"+
		"thunderbolt.\n"+
		"Thunder\n"+
		"Alas, the storm is come again! my best way is to\n"+
		"creep under his gaberdine; there is no other\n"+
		"shelter hereabouts: misery acquaints a man with\n"+
		"strange bed-fellows. I will here shroud till the\n"+
		"dregs of the storm be past.\n"+
		"Enter STEPHANO, singing: a bottle in his hand\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"I shall no more to sea, to sea,\n"+
		"Here shall I die ashore--\n"+
		"This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man's\n"+
		"funeral: well, here's my comfort.\n"+
		"Drinks\n"+
		"Sings\n"+
		"The master, the swabber, the boatswain and I,\n"+
		"The gunner and his mate\n"+
		"Loved Mall, Meg and Marian and Margery,\n"+
		"But none of us cared for Kate;\n"+
		"For she had a tongue with a tang,\n"+
		"Would cry to a sailor, Go hang!\n"+
		"She loved not the savour of tar nor of pitch,\n"+
		"Yet a tailor might scratch her where'er she did itch:\n"+
		"Then to sea, boys, and let her go hang!\n"+
		"This is a scurvy tune too: but here's my comfort.\n"+
		"Drinks\n"+
		"CALIBAN\n"+
		"Do not torment me: Oh!\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"What's the matter? Have we devils here? Do you put\n"+
		"tricks upon's with savages and men of Ind, ha? I\n"+
		"have not scaped drowning to be afeard now of your\n"+
		"four legs; for it hath been said, As proper a man as\n"+
		"ever went on four legs cannot make him give ground;\n"+
		"and it shall be said so again while Stephano\n"+
		"breathes at's nostrils.\n"+
		"CALIBAN\n"+
		"The spirit torments me; Oh!\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"This is some monster of the isle with four legs, who\n"+
		"hath got, as I take it, an ague. Where the devil\n"+
		"should he learn our language? I will give him some\n"+
		"relief, if it be but for that. if I can recover him\n"+
		"and keep him tame and get to Naples with him, he's a\n"+
		"present for any emperor that ever trod on neat's leather.\n"+
		"CALIBAN\n"+
		"Do not torment me, prithee; I'll bring my wood home faster.\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"He's in his fit now and does not talk after the\n"+
		"wisest. He shall taste of my bottle: if he have\n"+
		"never drunk wine afore will go near to remove his\n"+
		"fit. If I can recover him and keep him tame, I will\n"+
		"not take too much for him; he shall pay for him that\n"+
		"hath him, and that soundly.\n"+
		"CALIBAN\n"+
		"Thou dost me yet but little hurt; thou wilt anon, I\n"+
		"know it by thy trembling: now Prosper works upon thee.\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"Come on your ways; open your mouth; here is that\n"+
		"which will give language to you, cat: open your\n"+
		"mouth; this will shake your shaking, I can tell you,\n"+
		"and that soundly: you cannot tell who's your friend:\n"+
		"open your chaps again.\n"+
		"TRINCULO\n"+
		"I should know that voice: it should be--but he is\n"+
		"drowned; and these are devils: O defend me!\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"Four legs and two voices: a most delicate monster!\n"+
		"His forward voice now is to speak well of his\n"+
		"friend; his backward voice is to utter foul speeches\n"+
		"and to detract. If all the wine in my bottle will\n"+
		"recover him, I will help his ague. Come. Amen! I\n"+
		"will pour some in thy other mouth.\n"+
		"TRINCULO\n"+
		"Stephano!\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy, mercy! This is\n"+
		"a devil, and no monster: I will leave him; I have no\n"+
		"long spoon.\n"+
		"TRINCULO\n"+
		"Stephano! If thou beest Stephano, touch me and\n"+
		"speak to me: for I am Trinculo--be not afeard--thy\n"+
		"good friend Trinculo.\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"If thou beest Trinculo, come forth: I'll pull thee\n"+
		"by the lesser legs: if any be Trinculo's legs,\n"+
		"these are they. Thou art very Trinculo indeed! How\n"+
		"camest thou to be the siege of this moon-calf? can\n"+
		"he vent Trinculos?\n"+
		"TRINCULO\n"+
		"I took him to be killed with a thunder-stroke. But\n"+
		"art thou not drowned, Stephano? I hope now thou art\n"+
		"not drowned. Is the storm overblown? I hid me\n"+
		"under the dead moon-calf's gaberdine for fear of\n"+
		"the storm. And art thou living, Stephano? O\n"+
		"Stephano, two Neapolitans 'scaped!\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"Prithee, do not turn me about; my stomach is not constant.\n"+
		"CALIBAN\n"+
		"[Aside] These be fine things, an if they be\n"+
		"not sprites.\n"+
		"That's a brave god and bears celestial liquor.\n"+
		"I will kneel to him.\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"How didst thou 'scape? How camest thou hither?\n"+
		"swear by this bottle how thou camest hither. I\n"+
		"escaped upon a butt of sack which the sailors\n"+
		"heaved o'erboard, by this bottle; which I made of\n"+
		"the bark of a tree with mine own hands since I was\n"+
		"cast ashore.\n"+
		"CALIBAN\n"+
		"I'll swear upon that bottle to be thy true subject;\n"+
		"for the liquor is not earthly.\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"Here; swear then how thou escapedst.\n"+
		"TRINCULO\n"+
		"Swum ashore. man, like a duck: I can swim like a\n"+
		"duck, I'll be sworn.\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"Here, kiss the book. Though thou canst swim like a\n"+
		"duck, thou art made like a goose.\n"+
		"TRINCULO\n"+
		"O Stephano. hast any more of this?\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"The whole butt, man: my cellar is in a rock by the\n"+
		"sea-side where my wine is hid. How now, moon-calf!\n"+
		"how does thine ague?\n"+
		"CALIBAN\n"+
		"Hast thou not dropp'd from heaven?\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"Out o' the moon, I do assure thee: I was the man i'\n"+

		"Come, swear to that; kiss the book: I will furnish\n"+
		"it anon with new contents swear.\n"+
		"TRINCULO\n"+
		"By this good light, this is a very shallow monster!\n"+
		"I afeard of him! A very weak monster! The man i'\n"+
		"the moon! A most poor credulous monster! Well\n"+
		"drawn, monster, in good sooth!\n"+
		"CALIBAN\n"+
		"I'll show thee every fertile inch o' th' island;\n"+
		"And I will kiss thy foot: I prithee, be my god.\n"+
		"TRINCULO\n"+
		"By this light, a most perfidious and drunken\n"+
		"monster! when 's god's asleep, he'll rob his bottle.\n"+
		"CALIBAN\n"+
		"I'll kiss thy foot; I'll swear myself thy subject.\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"Come on then; down, and swear.\n"+

		"A plague upon the tyrant that I serve!\n"+

		"I prithee now, lead the way without any more\n"+
		"talking. Trinculo, the king and all our company\n"+

		"Enter FERDINAND, bearing a log\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"There be some sports are painful, and their labour\n"+
		"Delight in them sets off: some kinds of baseness\n"+
		"Are nobly undergone and most poor matters\n"+
		"Point to rich ends. This my mean task\n"+
		"Would be as heavy to me as odious, but\n"+
		"The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead\n"+
		"And makes my labours pleasures: O, she is\n"+
		"Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed,\n"+
		"And he's composed of harshness. I must remove\n"+
		"Some thousands of these logs and pile them up,\n"+
		"Upon a sore injunction: my sweet mistress\n"+
		"Weeps when she sees me work, and says, such baseness\n"+
		"Had never like executor. I forget:\n"+
		"But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours,\n"+
		"Most busy lest, when I do it.\n"+
		"Enter MIRANDA; and PROSPERO at a distance, unseen\n"+
		"MIRANDA\n"+
		"Alas, now, pray you,\n"+
		"Work not so hard: I would the lightning had\n"+

		"Have I liked several women; never any\n"+
		"With so fun soul, but some defect in her\n"+
		"Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed\n"+
		"And put it to the foil: but you, O you,\n"+
		"So perfect and so peerless, are created\n"+
		"Of every creature's best!\n"+
		"MIRANDA\n"+
		"I do not know\n"+
		"One of my sex; no woman's face remember,\n"+
		"Save, from my glass, mine own; nor have I seen\n"+
		"More that I may call men than you, good friend,\n"+
		"And my dear father: how features are abroad,\n"+
		"I am skilless of; but, by my modesty,\n"+
		"The jewel in my dower, I would not wish\n"+
		"Any companion in the world but you,\n"+
		"Nor can imagination form a shape,\n"+
		"Besides yourself, to like of. But I prattle\n"+
		"Something too wildly and my father's precepts\n"+

		"I am in my condition\n"+
		"A prince, Miranda; I do think, a king;\n"+
		"I would, not so!--and would no more endure\n"+
		"This wooden slavery than to suffer\n"+
		"The flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak:\n"+
		"The very instant that I saw you, did\n"+
		"My heart fly to your service; there resides,\n"+
		"To make me slave to it; and for your sake\n"+
		"Am I this patient log--man.\n"+
		"MIRANDA\n"+
		"Do you love me?\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this sound\n"+
		"And crown what I profess with kind event\n"+
		"If I speak true! if hollowly, invert\n"+
		"What best is boded me to mischief! I\n"+
		"Beyond all limit of what else i' the world\n"+
		"Do love, prize, honour you.\n"+
		"MIRANDA\n"+
		"I am a fool\n"+
		"To weep at what I am glad of.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Fair encounter\n"+
		"Of two most rare affections! Heavens rain grace\n"+
		"On that which breeds between 'em!\n"+

		"Wherefore weep you?\n"+
		"MIRANDA\n"+
		"At mine unworthiness that dare not offer\n"+
		"What I desire to give, and much less take\n"+
		"What I shall die to want. But this is trifling;\n"+
		"And all the more it seeks to hide itself,\n"+
		"The bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful cunning!\n"+
		"And prompt me, plain and holy innocence!\n"+

		"A thousand thousand!\n"+
		"Exeunt FERDINAND and MIRANDA severally\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"So glad of this as they I cannot be,\n"+

		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE II. Another part of the island.\n"+
		"Enter CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"Tell not me; when the butt is out, we will drink\n"+
		"water; not a drop before: therefore bear up, and\n"+
		"board 'em. Servant-monster, drink to me.\n"+
		"TRINCULO\n"+
		"Servant-monster! the folly of this island! They\n"+
		"say there's but five upon this isle: we are three\n"+
		"of them; if th' other two be brained like us, the\n"+
		"state totters.\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"Drink, servant-monster, when I bid thee: thy eyes\n"+
		"are almost set in thy head.\n"+
		"TRINCULO\n"+
		"Where should they be set else? he were a brave\n"+
		"monster indeed, if they were set in his tail.\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"My man-monster hath drown'd his tongue in sack:\n"+
		"for my part, the sea cannot drown me; I swam, ere I\n"+
		"could recover the shore, five and thirty leagues off\n"+
		"and on. By this light, thou shalt be my lieutenant,\n"+
		"monster, or my standard.\n"+
		"TRINCULO\n"+
		"Your lieutenant, if you list; he's no standard.\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"We'll not run, Monsieur Monster.\n"+
		"TRINCULO\n"+
		"Nor go neither; but you'll lie like dogs and yet say\n"+
		"nothing neither.\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"Moon-calf, speak once in thy life, if thou beest a\n"+
		"good moon-calf.\n"+
		"CALIBAN\n"+
		"How does thy honour? Let me lick thy shoe.\n"+
		"I'll not serve him; he's not valiant.\n"+
		"TRINCULO\n"+
		"Thou liest, most ignorant monster: I am in case to\n"+
		"justle a constable. Why, thou deboshed fish thou,\n"+
		"was there ever man a coward that hath drunk so much\n"+
		"sack as I to-day? Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie,\n"+
		"being but half a fish and half a monster?\n"+
		"CALIBAN\n"+
		"Lo, how he mocks me! wilt thou let him, my lord?\n"+
		"TRINCULO\n"+
		"'Lord' quoth he! That a monster should be such a natural!\n"+
		"CALIBAN\n"+
		"Lo, lo, again! bite him to death, I prithee.\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"Trinculo, keep a good tongue in your head: if you\n"+
		"prove a mutineer,--the next tree! The poor monster's\n"+
		"my subject and he shall not suffer indignity.\n"+
		"CALIBAN\n"+
		"I thank my noble lord. Wilt thou be pleased to\n"+
		"hearken once again to the suit I made to thee?\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"Marry, will I kneel and repeat it; I will stand,\n"+
		"and so shall Trinculo.\n"+
		"Enter ARIEL, invisible\n"+
		"CALIBAN\n"+
		"As I told thee before, I am subject to a tyrant, a\n"+
		"sorcerer, that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island.\n"+
		"ARIEL\n"+
		"Thou liest.\n"+
		"CALIBAN\n"+
		"Thou liest, thou jesting monkey, thou: I would my\n"+
		"valiant master would destroy thee! I do not lie.\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"Trinculo, if you trouble him any more in's tale, by\n"+
		"this hand, I will supplant some of your teeth.\n"+
		"TRINCULO\n"+
		"Why, I said nothing.\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"Mum, then, and no more. Proceed.\n"+
		"CALIBAN\n"+
		"I say, by sorcery he got this isle;\n"+
		"From me he got it. if thy greatness will\n"+
		"Revenge it on him,--for I know thou darest,\n"+
		"But this thing dare not,--\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"That's most certain.\n"+
		"CALIBAN\n"+
		"Thou shalt be lord of it and I'll serve thee.\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"How now shall this be compassed?\n"+
		"Canst thou bring me to the party?\n"+
		"CALIBAN\n"+
		"Yea, yea, my lord: I'll yield him thee asleep,\n"+
		"Where thou mayst knock a nail into his bead.\n"+
		"ARIEL\n"+
		"Thou liest; thou canst not.\n"+
		"CALIBAN\n"+
		"What a pied ninny's this! Thou scurvy patch!\n"+
		"I do beseech thy greatness, give him blows\n"+
		"And take his bottle from him: when that's gone\n"+
		"He shall drink nought but brine; for I'll not show him\n"+
		"Where the quick freshes are.\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"Trinculo, run into no further danger:\n"+
		"interrupt the monster one word further, and,\n"+
		"by this hand, I'll turn my mercy out o' doors\n"+
		"and make a stock-fish of thee.\n"+
		"TRINCULO\n"+
		"Why, what did I? I did nothing. I'll go farther\n"+
		"off.\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"Didst thou not say he lied?\n"+
		"ARIEL\n"+
		"Thou liest.\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"Do I so? take thou that.\n"+
		"Beats TRINCULO\n"+
		"As you like this, give me the lie another time.\n"+
		"TRINCULO\n"+
		"I did not give the lie. Out o' your\n"+
		"wits and bearing too? A pox o' your bottle!\n"+
		"this can sack and drinking do. A murrain on\n"+
		"your monster, and the devil take your fingers!\n"+
		"CALIBAN\n"+
		"Ha, ha, ha!\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"Now, forward with your tale. Prithee, stand farther\n"+
		"off.\n"+
		"CALIBAN\n"+
		"Beat him enough: after a little time\n"+
		"I'll beat him too.\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"Stand farther. Come, proceed.\n"+
		"CALIBAN\n"+
		"Why, as I told thee, 'tis a custom with him,\n"+
		"I' th' afternoon to sleep: there thou mayst brain him,\n"+
		"Having first seized his books, or with a log\n"+
		"Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,\n"+
		"Or cut his wezand with thy knife. Remember\n"+
		"First to possess his books; for without them\n"+
		"He's but a sot, as I am, nor hath not\n"+
		"One spirit to command: they all do hate him\n"+
		"As rootedly as I. Burn but his books.\n"+
		"He has brave utensils,--for so he calls them--\n"+
		"Which when he has a house, he'll deck withal\n"+
		"And that most deeply to consider is\n"+
		"The beauty of his daughter; he himself\n"+
		"Calls her a nonpareil: I never saw a woman,\n"+
		"But only Sycorax my dam and she;\n"+
		"But she as far surpasseth Sycorax\n"+
		"As great'st does least.\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"Is it so brave a lass?\n"+
		"CALIBAN\n"+
		"Ay, lord; she will become thy bed, I warrant.\n"+
		"And bring thee forth brave brood.\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"Monster, I will kill this man: his daughter and I\n"+
		"will be king and queen--save our graces!--and\n"+
		"Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys. Dost thou\n"+
		"like the plot, Trinculo?\n"+
		"TRINCULO\n"+
		"Excellent.\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"Give me thy hand: I am sorry I beat thee; but,\n"+
		"while thou livest, keep a good tongue in thy head.\n"+
		"CALIBAN\n"+
		"Within this half hour will he be asleep:\n"+
		"Wilt thou destroy him then?\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"Ay, on mine honour.\n"+
		"ARIEL\n"+
		"This will I tell my master.\n"+
		"CALIBAN\n"+
		"Thou makest me merry; I am full of pleasure:\n"+
		"Let us be jocund: will you troll the catch\n"+
		"You taught me but while-ere?\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"At thy request, monster, I will do reason, any\n"+
		"reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.\n"+
		"Sings\n"+
		"Flout 'em and scout 'em\n"+
		"And scout 'em and flout 'em\n"+
		"Thought is free.\n"+
		"CALIBAN\n"+
		"That's not the tune.\n"+
		"Ariel plays the tune on a tabour and pipe\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"What is this same?\n"+
		"TRINCULO\n"+
		"This is the tune of our catch, played by the picture\n"+
		"of Nobody.\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"If thou beest a man, show thyself in thy likeness:\n"+
		"if thou beest a devil, take't as thou list.\n"+
		"TRINCULO\n"+
		"O, forgive me my sins!\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"He that dies pays all debts: I defy thee. Mercy upon us!\n"+
		"CALIBAN\n"+
		"Art thou afeard?\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"No, monster, not I.\n"+
		"CALIBAN\n"+
		"Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises,\n"+
		"Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not.\n"+
		"Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments\n"+
		"Will hum about mine ears, and sometime voices\n"+
		"That, if I then had waked after long sleep,\n"+
		"Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming,\n"+
		"The clouds methought would open and show riches\n"+
		"Ready to drop upon me that, when I waked,\n"+
		"I cried to dream again.\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I shall\n"+
		"have my music for nothing.\n"+
		"CALIBAN\n"+
		"When Prospero is destroyed.\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"That shall be by and by: I remember the story.\n"+
		"TRINCULO\n"+
		"The sound is going away; let's follow it, and\n"+
		"after do our work.\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"Lead, monster; we'll follow. I would I could see\n"+
		"this tabourer; he lays it on.\n"+
		"TRINCULO\n"+
		"Wilt come? I'll follow, Stephano.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. Another part of the island.\n"+
		"Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO, ADRIAN, FRANCISCO, and others\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"By'r lakin, I can go no further, sir;\n"+
		"My old bones ache: here's a maze trod indeed\n"+
		"Through forth-rights and meanders! By your patience,\n"+
		"I needs must rest me.\n"+
		"ALONSO\n"+
		"Old lord, I cannot blame thee,\n"+
		"Who am myself attach'd with weariness,\n"+
		"To the dulling of my spirits: sit down, and rest.\n"+
		"Even here I will put off my hope and keep it\n"+
		"No longer for my flatterer: he is drown'd\n"+
		"Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks\n"+
		"Our frustrate search on land. Well, let him go.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"[Aside to SEBASTIAN] I am right glad that he's so\n"+
		"out of hope.\n"+
		"Do not, for one repulse, forego the purpose\n"+
		"That you resolved to effect.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"[Aside to ANTONIO] The next advantage\n"+
		"Will we take throughly.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"[Aside to SEBASTIAN] Let it be to-night;\n"+
		"For, now they are oppress'd with travel, they\n"+
		"Will not, nor cannot, use such vigilance\n"+
		"As when they are fresh.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"[Aside to ANTONIO] I say, to-night: no more.\n"+
		"Solemn and strange music\n"+
		"ALONSO\n"+
		"What harmony is this? My good friends, hark!\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"Marvellous sweet music!\n"+
		"Enter PROSPERO above, invisible. Enter several strange Shapes, bringing in a banquet; they dance about it with gentle actions of salutation; and, inviting the King, & c. to eat, they depart\n"+
		"ALONSO\n"+
		"Give us kind keepers, heavens! What were these?\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"A living drollery. Now I will believe\n"+
		"That there are unicorns, that in Arabia\n"+
		"There is one tree, the phoenix' throne, one phoenix\n"+
		"At this hour reigning there.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"I'll believe both;\n"+
		"And what does else want credit, come to me,\n"+
		"And I'll be sworn 'tis true: travellers ne'er did\n"+
		"lie,\n"+
		"Though fools at home condemn 'em.\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"If in Naples\n"+
		"I should report this now, would they believe me?\n"+
		"If I should say, I saw such islanders--\n"+
		"For, certes, these are people of the island--\n"+
		"Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet, note,\n"+
		"Their manners are more gentle-kind than of\n"+
		"Our human generation you shall find\n"+
		"Many, nay, almost any.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"[Aside] Honest lord,\n"+
		"Thou hast said well; for some of you there present\n"+
		"Are worse than devils.\n"+
		"ALONSO\n"+
		"I cannot too much muse\n"+
		"Such shapes, such gesture and such sound, expressing,\n"+
		"Although they want the use of tongue, a kind\n"+
		"Of excellent dumb discourse.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"[Aside] Praise in departing.\n"+
		"FRANCISCO\n"+
		"They vanish'd strangely.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"No matter, since\n"+
		"They have left their viands behind; for we have stomachs.\n"+
		"Will't please you taste of what is here?\n"+
		"ALONSO\n"+
		"Not I.\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"Faith, sir, you need not fear. When we were boys,\n"+
		"Who would believe that there were mountaineers\n"+
		"Dew-lapp'd like bulls, whose throats had hanging at 'em\n"+
		"Wallets of flesh? or that there were such men\n"+
		"Whose heads stood in their breasts? which now we find\n"+
		"Each putter-out of five for one will bring us\n"+
		"Good warrant of.\n"+
		"ALONSO\n"+
		"I will stand to and feed,\n"+
		"Although my last: no matter, since I feel\n"+
		"The best is past. Brother, my lord the duke,\n"+
		"Stand to and do as we.\n"+
		"Thunder and lightning. Enter ARIEL, like a harpy; claps his wings upon the table; and, with a quaint device, the banquet vanishes\n"+
		"ARIEL\n"+
		"You are three men of sin, whom Destiny,\n"+
		"That hath to instrument this lower world\n"+
		"And what is in't, the never-surfeited sea\n"+
		"Hath caused to belch up you; and on this island\n"+
		"Where man doth not inhabit; you 'mongst men\n"+
		"Being most unfit to live. I have made you mad;\n"+
		"And even with such-like valour men hang and drown\n"+
		"Their proper selves.\n"+
		"ALONSO, SEBASTIAN & c. draw their swords\n"+
		"You fools! I and my fellows\n"+
		"Are ministers of Fate: the elements,\n"+
		"Of whom your swords are temper'd, may as well\n"+
		"Wound the loud winds, or with bemock'd-at stabs\n"+
		"Kill the still-closing waters, as diminish\n"+
		"One dowle that's in my plume: my fellow-ministers\n"+
		"Are like invulnerable. If you could hurt,\n"+
		"Your swords are now too massy for your strengths\n"+
		"And will not be uplifted. But remember--\n"+
		"For that's my business to you--that you three\n"+
		"From Milan did supplant good Prospero;\n"+
		"Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it,\n"+
		"Him and his innocent child: for which foul deed\n"+
		"The powers, delaying, not forgetting, have\n"+
		"Incensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,\n"+
		"Against your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso,\n"+
		"They have bereft; and do pronounce by me:\n"+
		"Lingering perdition, worse than any death\n"+
		"Can be at once, shall step by step attend\n"+
		"You and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from--\n"+
		"Which here, in this most desolate isle, else falls\n"+
		"Upon your heads--is nothing but heart-sorrow\n"+
		"And a clear life ensuing.\n"+
		"He vanishes in thunder; then, to soft music enter the Shapes again, and dance, with mocks and mows, and carrying out the table\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou\n"+
		"Perform'd, my Ariel; a grace it had, devouring:\n"+
		"Of my instruction hast thou nothing bated\n"+
		"In what thou hadst to say: so, with good life\n"+
		"And observation strange, my meaner ministers\n"+
		"Their several kinds have done. My high charms work\n"+
		"And these mine enemies are all knit up\n"+
		"In their distractions; they now are in my power;\n"+
		"And in these fits I leave them, while I visit\n"+
		"Young Ferdinand, whom they suppose is drown'd,\n"+
		"And his and mine loved darling.\n"+
		"Exit above\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"I' the name of something holy, sir, why stand you\n"+
		"In this strange stare?\n"+
		"ALONSO\n"+
		"O, it is monstrous, monstrous:\n"+
		"Methought the billows spoke and told me of it;\n"+
		"The winds did sing it to me, and the thunder,\n"+
		"That deep and dreadful organ-pipe, pronounced\n"+
		"The name of Prosper: it did bass my trespass.\n"+
		"Therefore my son i' the ooze is bedded, and\n"+
		"I'll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded\n"+
		"And with him there lie mudded.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"But one fiend at a time,\n"+
		"I'll fight their legions o'er.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"I'll be thy second.\n"+
		"Exeunt SEBASTIAN, and ANTONIO\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"All three of them are desperate: their great guilt,\n"+
		"Like poison given to work a great time after,\n"+
		"Now 'gins to bite the spirits. I do beseech you\n"+
		"That are of suppler joints, follow them swiftly\n"+
		"And hinder them from what this ecstasy\n"+
		"May now provoke them to.\n"+
		"ADRIAN\n"+
		"Follow, I pray you.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT IV\n"+
		"SCENE I. Before PROSPERO'S cell.\n"+
		"Enter PROSPERO, FERDINAND, and MIRANDA\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"If I have too austerely punish'd you,\n"+
		"Your compensation makes amends, for I\n"+
		"Have given you here a third of mine own life,\n"+
		"Or that for which I live; who once again\n"+
		"I tender to thy hand: all thy vexations\n"+
		"Were but my trials of thy love and thou\n"+
		"Hast strangely stood the test here, afore Heaven,\n"+
		"I ratify this my rich gift. O Ferdinand,\n"+
		"Do not smile at me that I boast her off,\n"+
		"For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise\n"+
		"And make it halt behind her.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"I do believe it\n"+
		"Against an oracle.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Then, as my gift and thine own acquisition\n"+
		"Worthily purchased take my daughter: but\n"+
		"If thou dost break her virgin-knot before\n"+
		"All sanctimonious ceremonies may\n"+
		"With full and holy rite be minister'd,\n"+
		"No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall\n"+
		"To make this contract grow: but barren hate,\n"+
		"Sour-eyed disdain and discord shall bestrew\n"+
		"The union of your bed with weeds so loathly\n"+
		"That you shall hate it both: therefore take heed,\n"+
		"As Hymen's lamps shall light you.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"As I hope\n"+
		"For quiet days, fair issue and long life,\n"+
		"With such love as 'tis now, the murkiest den,\n"+
		"The most opportune place, the strong'st suggestion.\n"+
		"Our worser genius can, shall never melt\n"+
		"Mine honour into lust, to take away\n"+
		"The edge of that day's celebration\n"+
		"When I shall think: or Phoebus' steeds are founder'd,\n"+
		"Or Night kept chain'd below.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Fairly spoke.\n"+
		"Sit then and talk with her; she is thine own.\n"+
		"What, Ariel! my industrious servant, Ariel!\n"+
		"Enter ARIEL\n"+
		"ARIEL\n"+
		"What would my potent master? here I am.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service\n"+
		"Did worthily perform; and I must use you\n"+
		"In such another trick. Go bring the rabble,\n"+
		"O'er whom I give thee power, here to this place:\n"+
		"Incite them to quick motion; for I must\n"+
		"Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple\n"+
		"Some vanity of mine art: it is my promise,\n"+
		"And they expect it from me.\n"+
		"ARIEL\n"+
		"Presently?\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Ay, with a twink.\n"+
		"ARIEL\n"+
		"Before you can say 'come' and 'go,'\n"+
		"And breathe twice and cry 'so, so,'\n"+
		"Each one, tripping on his toe,\n"+
		"Will be here with mop and mow.\n"+
		"Do you love me, master? no?\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Dearly my delicate Ariel. Do not approach\n"+
		"Till thou dost hear me call.\n"+
		"ARIEL\n"+
		"Well, I conceive.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Look thou be true; do not give dalliance\n"+
		"Too much the rein: the strongest oaths are straw\n"+
		"To the fire i' the blood: be more abstemious,\n"+
		"Or else, good night your vow!\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"I warrant you sir;\n"+
		"The white cold virgin snow upon my heart\n"+
		"Abates the ardour of my liver.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Well.\n"+
		"Now come, my Ariel! bring a corollary,\n"+
		"Rather than want a spirit: appear and pertly!\n"+
		"No tongue! all eyes! be silent.\n"+

		"Thy banks with pioned and twilled brims,\n"+
		"Which spongy April at thy hest betrims,\n"+
		"To make cold nymphs chaste crowns; and thy broom -groves,\n"+
		"Whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves,\n"+
		"Being lass-lorn: thy pole-clipt vineyard;\n"+

		"Tell me, heavenly bow,\n"+
		"If Venus or her son, as thou dost know,\n"+
		"Do now attend the queen? Since they did plot\n"+

		"Of her society\n"+

		"And these fresh nymphs encounter every one\n"+
		"In country footing.\n"+
		"Enter certain Reapers, properly habited: they join with the Nymphs in a graceful dance; towards the end whereof PROSPERO starts suddenly, and speaks; after which, to a strange, hollow, and confused noise, they heavily vanish\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"[Aside] I had forgot that foul conspiracy\n"+

		"Well done! avoid; no more!\n"+

		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"You do look, my son, in a moved sort,\n"+
		"As if you were dismay'd: be cheerful, sir.\n"+
		"Our revels now are ended. These our actors,\n"+
		"As I foretold you, were all spirits and\n"+

		"And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,\n"+
		"The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces,\n"+
		"The solemn temples, the great globe itself,\n"+
		"Ye all which it inherit, shall dissolve\n"+
		"And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,\n"+
		"Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff\n"+
		"As dreams are made on, and our little life\n"+
		"Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vex'd;\n"+
		"Bear with my weakness; my, brain is troubled:\n"+
		"Be not disturb'd with my infirmity:\n"+
		"If you be pleased, retire into my cell\n"+

		"Ay, my commander: when I presented Ceres,\n"+
		"I thought to have told thee of it, but I fear'd\n"+
		"Lest I might anger thee.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Say again, where didst thou leave these varlets?\n"+
		"ARIEL\n"+
		"I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking;\n"+
		"So fun of valour that they smote the air\n"+
		"For breathing in their faces; beat the ground\n"+
		"For kissing of their feet; yet always bending\n"+
		"Towards their project. Then I beat my tabour;\n"+
		"At which, like unback'd colts, they prick'd\n"+
		"their ears,\n"+
		"Advanced their eyelids, lifted up their noses\n"+
		"As they smelt music: so I charm'd their ears\n"+
		"That calf-like they my lowing follow'd through\n"+
		"Tooth'd briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss and thorns,\n"+
		"Which entered their frail shins: at last I left them\n"+
		"I' the filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell,\n"+
		"There dancing up to the chins, that the foul lake\n"+
		"O'erstunk their feet.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"This was well done, my bird.\n"+
		"Thy shape invisible retain thou still:\n"+

		"A devil, a born devil, on whose nature\n"+
		"Nurture can never stick; on whom my pains,\n"+

		"So his mind cankers. I will plague them all,\n"+
		"Even to roaring.\n"+
		"Re-enter ARIEL, loaden with glistering apparel, & c\n"+
		"Come, hang them on this line.\n"+
		"PROSPERO and ARIEL remain invisible. Enter CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO, all wet\n"+
		"CALIBAN\n"+
		"Pray you, tread softly, that the blind mole may not\n"+
		"Hear a foot fall: we now are near his cell.\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"Monster, your fairy, which you say is\n"+
		"a harmless fairy, has done little better than\n"+
		"played the Jack with us.\n"+
		"TRINCULO\n"+
		"Monster, I do smell all horse-piss; at\n"+
		"which my nose is in great indignation.\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"So is mine. Do you hear, monster? If I should take\n"+
		"a displeasure against you, look you,--\n"+
		"TRINCULO\n"+
		"Thou wert but a lost monster.\n"+
		"CALIBAN\n"+
		"Good my lord, give me thy favour still.\n"+
		"Be patient, for the prize I'll bring thee to\n"+
		"Shall hoodwink this mischance: therefore speak softly.\n"+
		"All's hush'd as midnight yet.\n"+
		"TRINCULO\n"+
		"Ay, but to lose our bottles in the pool,--\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"There is not only disgrace and dishonour in that,\n"+
		"monster, but an infinite loss.\n"+
		"TRINCULO\n"+
		"That's more to me than my wetting: yet this is your\n"+
		"harmless fairy, monster.\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"I will fetch off my bottle, though I be o'er ears\n"+
		"for my labour.\n"+
		"CALIBAN\n"+
		"Prithee, my king, be quiet. Seest thou here,\n"+
		"This is the mouth o' the cell: no noise, and enter.\n"+
		"Do that good mischief which may make this island\n"+
		"Thine own for ever, and I, thy Caliban,\n"+
		"For aye thy foot-licker.\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"Give me thy hand. I do begin to have bloody thoughts.\n"+
		"TRINCULO\n"+
		"O king Stephano! O peer! O worthy Stephano! look\n"+
		"what a wardrobe here is for thee!\n"+
		"CALIBAN\n"+
		"Let it alone, thou fool; it is but trash.\n"+
		"TRINCULO\n"+
		"O, ho, monster! we know what belongs to a frippery.\n"+
		"O king Stephano!\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"Put off that gown, Trinculo; by this hand, I'll have\n"+
		"that gown.\n"+
		"TRINCULO\n"+
		"Thy grace shall have it.\n"+
		"CALIBAN\n"+
		"The dropsy drown this fool I what do you mean\n"+
		"To dote thus on such luggage? Let's alone\n"+
		"And do the murder first: if he awake,\n"+
		"From toe to crown he'll fill our skins with pinches,\n"+
		"Make us strange stuff.\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"Be you quiet, monster. Mistress line,\n"+
		"is not this my jerkin? Now is the jerkin under\n"+
		"the line: now, jerkin, you are like to lose your\n"+
		"hair and prove a bald jerkin.\n"+
		"TRINCULO\n"+
		"Do, do: we steal by line and level, an't like your grace.\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"I thank thee for that jest; here's a garment for't:\n"+
		"wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of this\n"+
		"country. 'Steal by line and level' is an excellent\n"+
		"pass of pate; there's another garment for't.\n"+
		"TRINCULO\n"+
		"Monster, come, put some lime upon your fingers, and\n"+
		"away with the rest.\n"+
		"CALIBAN\n"+
		"I will have none on't: we shall lose our time,\n"+
		"And all be turn'd to barnacles, or to apes\n"+
		"With foreheads villanous low.\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"Monster, lay-to your fingers: help to bear this\n"+
		"away where my hogshead of wine is, or I'll turn you\n"+
		"out of my kingdom: go to, carry this.\n"+
		"TRINCULO\n"+
		"And this.\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"Ay, and this.\n"+
		"A noise of hunters heard. Enter divers Spirits, in shape of dogs and hounds, and hunt them about, PROSPERO and ARIEL setting them on\n"+

		"Silver I there it goes, Silver!\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+

		"CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO, are driven out\n"+
		"Go charge my goblins that they grind their joints\n"+
		"With dry convulsions, shorten up their sinews\n"+

		"Than pard or cat o' mountain.\n"+
		"ARIEL\n"+
		"Hark, they roar!\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Let them be hunted soundly. At this hour\n"+
		"Lie at my mercy all mine enemies:\n"+
		"Shortly shall all my labours end, and thou\n"+
		"Shalt have the air at freedom: for a little\n"+
		"Follow, and do me service.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT V\n"+
		"SCENE I. Before PROSPERO'S cell.\n"+
		"Enter PROSPERO in his magic robes, and ARIEL\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Now does my project gather to a head:\n"+
		"My charms crack not; my spirits obey; and time\n"+
		"Goes upright with his carriage. How's the day?\n"+
		"ARIEL\n"+
		"On the sixth hour; at which time, my lord,\n"+
		"You said our work should cease.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"I did say so,\n"+
		"When first I raised the tempest. Say, my spirit,\n"+
		"How fares the king and's followers?\n"+
		"ARIEL\n"+
		"Confined together\n"+
		"In the same fashion as you gave in charge,\n"+
		"Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir,\n"+
		"In the line-grove which weather-fends your cell;\n"+
		"They cannot budge till your release. The king,\n"+
		"His brother and yours, abide all three distracted\n"+
		"And the remainder mourning over them,\n"+
		"Brimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly\n"+
		"Him that you term'd, sir, 'The good old lord Gonzalo;'\n"+
		"His tears run down his beard, like winter's drops\n"+
		"From eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works 'em\n"+
		"That if you now beheld them, your affections\n"+
		"Would become tender.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Dost thou think so, spirit?\n"+
		"ARIEL\n"+
		"Mine would, sir, were I human.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"And mine shall.\n"+
		"Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling\n"+
		"Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,\n"+
		"One of their kind, that relish all as sharply,\n"+
		"Passion as they, be kindlier moved than thou art?\n"+
		"Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick,\n"+
		"Yet with my nobler reason 'gaitist my fury\n"+
		"Do I take part: the rarer action is\n"+
		"In virtue than in vengeance: they being penitent,\n"+
		"The sole drift of my purpose doth extend\n"+
		"Not a frown further. Go release them, Ariel:\n"+
		"My charms I'll break, their senses I'll restore,\n"+
		"And they shall be themselves.\n"+
		"ARIEL\n"+
		"I'll fetch them, sir.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes and groves,\n"+
		"And ye that on the sands with printless foot\n"+
		"Do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him\n"+
		"When he comes back; you demi-puppets that\n"+
		"By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,\n"+
		"Whereof the ewe not bites, and you whose pastime\n"+
		"Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice\n"+
		"To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid,\n"+
		"Weak masters though ye be, I have bedimm'd\n"+
		"The noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds,\n"+
		"And 'twixt the green sea and the azured vault\n"+
		"Set roaring war: to the dread rattling thunder\n"+
		"Have I given fire and rifted Jove's stout oak\n"+
		"With his own bolt; the strong-based promontory\n"+
		"Have I made shake and by the spurs pluck'd up\n"+
		"The pine and cedar: graves at my command\n"+
		"Have waked their sleepers, oped, and let 'em forth\n"+
		"By my so potent art. But this rough magic\n"+
		"I here abjure, and, when I have required\n"+
		"Some heavenly music, which even now I do,\n"+
		"To work mine end upon their senses that\n"+
		"This airy charm is for, I'll break my staff,\n"+
		"Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,\n"+
		"And deeper than did ever plummet sound\n"+
		"I'll drown my book.\n"+
		"Solemn music\n"+
		"Re-enter ARIEL before: then ALONSO, with a frantic gesture, attended by GONZALO; SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO in like manner, attended by ADRIAN and FRANCISCO they all enter the circle which PROSPERO had made, and there stand charmed; which PROSPERO observing, speaks:\n"+
		"A solemn air and the best comforter\n"+
		"To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains,\n"+
		"Now useless, boil'd within thy skull! There stand,\n"+
		"For you are spell-stopp'd.\n"+
		"Holy Gonzalo, honourable man,\n"+
		"Mine eyes, even sociable to the show of thine,\n"+
		"Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace,\n"+
		"And as the morning steals upon the night,\n"+
		"Melting the darkness, so their rising senses\n"+
		"Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle\n"+
		"Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,\n"+
		"My true preserver, and a loyal sir\n"+
		"To him you follow'st! I will pay thy graces\n"+
		"Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly\n"+
		"Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter:\n"+
		"Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.\n"+
		"Thou art pinch'd fort now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,\n"+
		"You, brother mine, that entertain'd ambition,\n"+
		"Expell'd remorse and nature; who, with Sebastian,\n"+
		"Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong,\n"+
		"Would here have kill'd your king; I do forgive thee,\n"+
		"Unnatural though thou art. Their understanding\n"+
		"Begins to swell, and the approaching tide\n"+
		"Will shortly fill the reasonable shore\n"+
		"That now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them\n"+
		"That yet looks on me, or would know me Ariel,\n"+
		"Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell:\n"+
		"I will discase me, and myself present\n"+
		"As I was sometime Milan: quickly, spirit;\n"+
		"Thou shalt ere long be free.\n"+

		"Where the bee sucks. there suck I:\n"+
		"In a cowslip's bell I lie;\n"+
		"There I couch when owls do cry.\n"+
		"On the bat's back I do fly\n"+
		"After summer merrily.\n"+
		"Merrily, merrily shall I live now\n"+
		"Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Why, that's my dainty Ariel! I shall miss thee:\n"+
		"But yet thou shalt have freedom: so, so, so.\n"+
		"To the king's ship, invisible as thou art:\n"+
		"There shalt thou find the mariners asleep\n"+
		"Under the hatches; the master and the boatswain\n"+
		"Being awake, enforce them to this place,\n"+
		"And presently, I prithee.\n"+
		"ARIEL\n"+
		"I drink the air before me, and return\n"+
		"Or ere your pulse twice beat.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"All torment, trouble, wonder and amazement\n"+
		"Inhabits here: some heavenly power guide us\n"+
		"Out of this fearful country!\n"+

		"Behold, sir king,\n"+
		"The wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero:\n"+
		"For more assurance that a living prince\n"+
		"Does now speak to thee, I embrace thy body;\n"+
		"And to thee and thy company I bid\n"+
		"A hearty welcome.\n"+
		"ALONSO\n"+
		"Whether thou best he or no,\n"+
		"Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me,\n"+
		"As late I have been, I not know: thy pulse\n"+
		"Beats as of flesh and blood; and, since I saw thee,\n"+
		"The affliction of my mind amends, with which,\n"+
		"I fear, a madness held me: this must crave,\n"+
		"An if this be at all, a most strange story.\n"+
		"Thy dukedom I resign and do entreat\n"+
		"Thou pardon me my wrongs. But how should Prospero\n"+
		"Be living and be here?\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"First, noble friend,\n"+
		"Let me embrace thine age, whose honour cannot\n"+

		"Whether this be\n"+
		"Or be not, I'll not swear.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"You do yet taste\n"+
		"Some subtilties o' the isle, that will not let you\n"+
		"Believe things certain. Welcome, my friends all!\n"+
		"Aside to SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO\n"+
		"But you, my brace of lords, were I so minded,\n"+
		"I here could pluck his highness' frown upon you\n"+
		"And justify you traitors: at this time\n"+
		"I will tell no tales.\n"+

		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"No.\n"+
		"For you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother\n"+
		"Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive\n"+
		"Thy rankest fault; all of them; and require\n"+
		"My dukedom of thee, which perforce, I know,\n"+
		"Thou must restore.\n"+
		"ALONSO\n"+
		"If thou be'st Prospero,\n"+
		"Give us particulars of thy preservation;\n"+
		"How thou hast met us here, who three hours since\n"+
		"Were wreck'd upon this shore; where I have lost--\n"+
		"How sharp the point of this remembrance is!--\n"+
		"My dear son Ferdinand.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"I am woe for't, sir.\n"+
		"ALONSO\n"+
		"Irreparable is the loss, and patience\n"+
		"Says it is past her cure.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"I rather think\n"+
		"You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace\n"+
		"For the like loss I have her sovereign aid\n"+
		"And rest myself content.\n"+
		"ALONSO\n"+
		"You the like loss!\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"As great to me as late; and, supportable\n"+
		"To make the dear loss, have I means much weaker\n"+
		"Than you may call to comfort you, for I\n"+
		"Have lost my daughter.\n"+
		"ALONSO\n"+
		"A daughter?\n"+
		"O heavens, that they were living both in Naples,\n"+
		"The king and queen there! that they were, I wish\n"+
		"Myself were mudded in that oozy bed\n"+
		"Where my son lies. When did you lose your daughter?\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"In this last tempest. I perceive these lords\n"+
		"At this encounter do so much admire\n"+
		"That they devour their reason and scarce think\n"+
		"Their eyes do offices of truth, their words\n"+
		"Are natural breath: but, howsoe'er you have\n"+
		"Been justled from your senses, know for certain\n"+
		"That I am Prospero and that very duke\n"+
		"Which was thrust forth of Milan, who most strangely\n"+
		"Upon this shore, where you were wreck'd, was landed,\n"+
		"To be the lord on't. No more yet of this;\n"+
		"For 'tis a chronicle of day by day,\n"+
		"Not a relation for a breakfast nor\n"+
		"Befitting this first meeting. Welcome, sir;\n"+
		"This cell's my court: here have I few attendants\n"+
		"And subjects none abroad: pray you, look in.\n"+
		"My dukedom since you have given me again,\n"+
		"I will requite you with as good a thing;\n"+
		"At least bring forth a wonder, to content ye\n"+
		"As much as me my dukedom.\n"+
		"Here PROSPERO discovers FERDINAND and MIRANDA playing at chess\n"+
		"MIRANDA\n"+
		"Sweet lord, you play me false.\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"No, my dear'st love,\n"+
		"I would not for the world.\n"+
		"MIRANDA\n"+
		"Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle,\n"+
		"And I would call it, fair play.\n"+
		"ALONSO\n"+
		"If this prove\n"+
		"A vision of the Island, one dear son\n"+
		"Shall I twice lose.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"A most high miracle!\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+

		"'Tis new to thee.\n"+
		"ALONSO\n"+
		"What is this maid with whom thou wast at play?\n"+
		"Your eld'st acquaintance cannot be three hours:\n"+
		"Is she the goddess that hath sever'd us,\n"+
		"And brought us thus together?\n"+
		"FERDINAND\n"+
		"Sir, she is mortal;\n"+
		"But by immortal Providence she's mine:\n"+
		"I chose her when I could not ask my father\n"+
		"For his advice, nor thought I had one. She\n"+
		"Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan,\n"+
		"Of whom so often I have heard renown,\n"+
		"But never saw before; of whom I have\n"+
		"Received a second life; and second father\n"+
		"This lady makes him to me.\n"+
		"ALONSO\n"+
		"I am hers:\n"+
		"But, O, how oddly will it sound that I\n"+
		"Must ask my child forgiveness!\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"There, sir, stop:\n"+
		"Let us not burthen our remembrance with\n"+
		"A heaviness that's gone.\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"I have inly wept,\n"+
		"Or should have spoke ere this. Look down, you god,\n"+
		"And on this couple drop a blessed crown!\n"+
		"For it is you that have chalk'd forth the way\n"+
		"Which brought us hither.\n"+
		"ALONSO\n"+
		"I say, Amen, Gonzalo!\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue\n"+
		"Should become kings of Naples? O, rejoice\n"+
		"Beyond a common joy, and set it down\n"+
		"With gold on lasting pillars: In one voyage\n"+
		"Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis,\n"+
		"And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife\n"+
		"Where he himself was lost, Prospero his dukedom\n"+
		"In a poor isle and all of us ourselves\n"+
		"When no man was his own.\n"+
		"ALONSO\n"+
		"[To FERDINAND and MIRANDA] Give me your hands:\n"+
		"Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart\n"+
		"That doth not wish you joy!\n"+
		"GONZALO\n"+
		"Be it so! Amen!\n"+
		"Re-enter ARIEL, with the Master and Boatswain amazedly following\n"+
		"O, look, sir, look, sir! here is more of us:\n"+
		"I prophesied, if a gallows were on land,\n"+
		"This fellow could not drown. Now, blasphemy,\n"+
		"That swear'st grace o'erboard, not an oath on shore?\n"+
		"Hast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?\n"+
		"Boatswain\n"+
		"The best news is, that we have safely found\n"+
		"Our king and company; the next, our ship--\n"+
		"Which, but three glasses since, we gave out split--\n"+
		"Is tight and yare and bravely rigg'd as when\n"+
		"We first put out to sea.\n"+
		"ARIEL\n"+
		"[Aside to PROSPERO] Sir, all this service\n"+
		"Have I done since I went.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"[Aside to ARIEL] My tricksy spirit!\n"+
		"ALONSO\n"+
		"These are not natural events; they strengthen\n"+
		"From strange to stranger. Say, how came you hither?\n"+
		"Boatswain\n"+
		"If I did think, sir, I were well awake,\n"+
		"I'ld strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep,\n"+
		"And--how we know not--all clapp'd under hatches;\n"+
		"Where but even now with strange and several noises\n"+
		"Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,\n"+
		"And more diversity of sounds, all horrible,\n"+
		"We were awaked; straightway, at liberty;\n"+
		"Where we, in all her trim, freshly beheld\n"+
		"Our royal, good and gallant ship, our master\n"+
		"Capering to eye her: on a trice, so please you,\n"+
		"Even in a dream, were we divided from them\n"+
		"And were brought moping hither.\n"+
		"ARIEL\n"+
		"[Aside to PROSPERO] Was't well done?\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"[Aside to ARIEL] Bravely, my diligence. Thou shalt be free.\n"+
		"ALONSO\n"+
		"This is as strange a maze as e'er men trod\n"+
		"And there is in this business more than nature\n"+
		"Was ever conduct of: some oracle\n"+
		"Must rectify our knowledge.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Sir, my liege,\n"+
		"Do not infest your mind with beating on\n"+
		"The strangeness of this business; at pick'd leisure\n"+
		"Which shall be shortly, single I'll resolve you,\n"+
		"Which to you shall seem probable, of every\n"+
		"These happen'd accidents; till when, be cheerful\n"+
		"And think of each thing well.\n"+
		"Aside to ARIEL\n"+
		"Come hither, spirit:\n"+
		"Set Caliban and his companions free;\n"+
		"Untie the spell.\n"+
		"Exit ARIEL\n"+
		"How fares my gracious sir?\n"+
		"There are yet missing of your company\n"+
		"Some few odd lads that you remember not.\n"+
		"Re-enter ARIEL, driving in CALIBAN, STEPHANO and TRINCULO, in their stolen apparel\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"Every man shift for all the rest, and\n"+
		"let no man take care for himself; for all is\n"+
		"but fortune. Coragio, bully-monster, coragio!\n"+
		"TRINCULO\n"+
		"If these be true spies which I wear in my head,\n"+
		"here's a goodly sight.\n"+
		"CALIBAN\n"+
		"O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed!\n"+
		"How fine my master is! I am afraid\n"+
		"He will chastise me.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"Ha, ha!\n"+
		"What things are these, my lord Antonio?\n"+
		"Will money buy 'em?\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Very like; one of them\n"+
		"Is a plain fish, and, no doubt, marketable.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Mark but the badges of these men, my lords,\n"+
		"Then say if they be true. This mis-shapen knave,\n"+
		"His mother was a witch, and one so strong\n"+
		"That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,\n"+
		"And deal in her command without her power.\n"+
		"These three have robb'd me; and this demi-devil--\n"+
		"For he's a bastard one--had plotted with them\n"+
		"To take my life. Two of these fellows you\n"+
		"Must know and own; this thing of darkness!\n"+
		"Acknowledge mine.\n"+
		"CALIBAN\n"+
		"I shall be pinch'd to death.\n"+
		"ALONSO\n"+
		"Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"He is drunk now: where had he wine?\n"+
		"ALONSO\n"+
		"And Trinculo is reeling ripe: where should they\n"+
		"Find this grand liquor that hath gilded 'em?\n"+
		"How camest thou in this pickle?\n"+
		"TRINCULO\n"+
		"I have been in such a pickle since I\n"+
		"saw you last that, I fear me, will never out of\n"+
		"my bones: I shall not fear fly-blowing.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"Why, how now, Stephano!\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"O, touch me not; I am not Stephano, but a cramp.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"You'ld be king o' the isle, sirrah?\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"I should have been a sore one then.\n"+
		"ALONSO\n"+
		"This is a strange thing as e'er I look'd on.\n"+
		"Pointing to Caliban\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"He is as disproportion'd in his manners\n"+
		"As in his shape. Go, sirrah, to my cell;\n"+
		"Take with you your companions; as you look\n"+
		"To have my pardon, trim it handsomely.\n"+
		"CALIBAN\n"+
		"Ay, that I will; and I'll be wise hereafter\n"+
		"And seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass\n"+
		"Was I, to take this drunkard for a god\n"+
		"And worship this dull fool!\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Go to; away!\n"+
		"ALONSO\n"+
		"Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"Or stole it, rather.\n"+
		"Exeunt CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"Sir, I invite your highness and your train\n"+
		"To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest\n"+
		"For this one night; which, part of it, I'll waste\n"+
		"With such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it\n"+
		"Go quick away; the story of my life\n"+
		"And the particular accidents gone by\n"+
		"Since I came to this isle: and in the morn\n"+
		"I'll bring you to your ship and so to Naples,\n"+
		"Where I have hope to see the nuptial\n"+
		"Of these our dear-beloved solemnized;\n"+
		"And thence retire me to my Milan, where\n"+
		"Every third thought shall be my grave.\n"+
		"ALONSO\n"+
		"I long\n"+
		"To hear the story of your life, which must\n"+
		"Take the ear strangely.\n"+
		"PROSPERO\n"+
		"I'll deliver all;\n"+
		"And promise you calm seas, auspicious gales\n"+
		"And sail so expeditious that shall catch\n"+
		"Your royal fleet far off.\n"+
		"Aside to ARIEL\n"+
		"My Ariel, chick,\n"+
		"That is thy charge: then to the elements\n"+
		"Be free, and fare thou well! Please you, draw near.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"EPILOGUE\n"+
		"SPOKEN BY PROSPERO\n"+
		"Now my charms are all o'erthrown,\n"+
		"And what strength I have's mine own,\n"+
		"Which is most faint: now, 'tis true,\n"+
		"I must be here confined by you,\n"+
		"Or sent to Naples. Let me not,\n"+
		"Since I have my dukedom got\n"+
		"And pardon'd the deceiver, dwell\n"+
		"In this bare island by your spell;\n"+
		"But release me from my bands\n"+
		"With the help of your good hands:\n"+
		"Gentle breath of yours my sails\n"+
		"Must fill, or else my project fails,\n"+
		"Which was to please. Now I want\n"+
		"Spirits to enforce, art to enchant,\n"+
		"And my ending is despair,\n"+
		"Unless I be relieved by prayer,\n"+
		"Which pierces so that it assaults\n"+
		"Mercy itself and frees all faults.\n"+
		"As you from crimes would pardon'd be,\n"+
		"Let your indulgence set me free.\n"
