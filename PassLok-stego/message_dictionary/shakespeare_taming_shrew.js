		"The Taming of the Shrew\n"+
		"SCENE I. Before an alehouse on a heath.\n"+
		"Enter Hostess and SLY\n"+
		"SLY\n"+
		"I'll pheeze you, in faith.\n"+
		"Hostess\n"+
		"A pair of stocks, you rogue!\n"+
		"SLY\n"+
		"Ye are a baggage: the Slys are no rogues; look in\n"+
		"the chronicles; we came in with Richard Conqueror.\n"+
		"Therefore paucas pallabris; let the world slide: sessa!\n"+
		"Hostess\n"+
		"You will not pay for the glasses you have burst?\n"+
		"SLY\n"+
		"No, not a denier. Go by, Jeronimy: go to thy cold\n"+
		"bed, and warm thee.\n"+
		"Hostess\n"+
		"I know my remedy; I must go fetch the\n"+
		"third--borough.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SLY\n"+
		"Third, or fourth, or fifth borough, I'll answer him\n"+
		"by law: I'll not budge an inch, boy: let him come,\n"+
		"and kindly.\n"+
		"Falls asleep\n"+
		"Horns winded. Enter a Lord from hunting, with his train\n"+
		"Lord\n"+
		"Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds:\n"+
		"Brach Merriman, the poor cur is emboss'd;\n"+
		"And couple Clowder with the deep--mouth'd brach.\n"+
		"Saw'st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good\n"+
		"At the hedge-corner, in the coldest fault?\n"+
		"I would not lose the dog for twenty pound.\n"+
		"First Huntsman\n"+
		"Why, Belman is as good as he, my lord;\n"+
		"He cried upon it at the merest loss\n"+
		"And twice to-day pick'd out the dullest scent:\n"+
		"Trust me, I take him for the better dog.\n"+
		"Lord\n"+
		"Thou art a fool: if Echo were as fleet,\n"+
		"I would esteem him worth a dozen such.\n"+
		"But sup them well and look unto them all:\n"+
		"To-morrow I intend to hunt again.\n"+
		"First Huntsman\n"+
		"I will, my lord.\n"+
		"Lord\n"+
		"What's here? one dead, or drunk? See, doth he breathe?\n"+
		"Second Huntsman\n"+
		"He breathes, my lord. Were he not warm'd with ale,\n"+
		"This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly.\n"+
		"Lord\n"+
		"O monstrous beast! how like a swine he lies!\n"+
		"Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image!\n"+
		"Sirs, I will practise on this drunken man.\n"+
		"What think you, if he were convey'd to bed,\n"+
		"Wrapp'd in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers,\n"+
		"A most delicious banquet by his bed,\n"+
		"And brave attendants near him when he wakes,\n"+
		"Would not the beggar then forget himself?\n"+
		"First Huntsman\n"+
		"Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose.\n"+
		"Second Huntsman\n"+
		"It would seem strange unto him when he waked.\n"+
		"Lord\n"+
		"Even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy.\n"+
		"Then take him up and manage well the jest:\n"+
		"Carry him gently to my fairest chamber\n"+
		"And hang it round with all my wanton pictures:\n"+
		"Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters\n"+
		"And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet:\n"+
		"Procure me music ready when he wakes,\n"+
		"To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound;\n"+
		"And if he chance to speak, be ready straight\n"+
		"And with a low submissive reverence\n"+
		"Say 'What is it your honour will command?'\n"+
		"Let one attend him with a silver basin\n"+
		"Full of rose-water and bestrew'd with flowers,\n"+
		"Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,\n"+
		"And say 'Will't please your lordship cool your hands?'\n"+
		"Some one be ready with a costly suit\n"+
		"And ask him what apparel he will wear;\n"+
		"Another tell him of his hounds and horse,\n"+
		"And that his lady mourns at his disease:\n"+
		"Persuade him that he hath been lunatic;\n"+
		"And when he says he is, say that he dreams,\n"+
		"For he is nothing but a mighty lord.\n"+
		"This do and do it kindly, gentle sirs:\n"+
		"It will be pastime passing excellent,\n"+
		"If it be husbanded with modesty.\n"+
		"First Huntsman\n"+
		"My lord, I warrant you we will play our part,\n"+
		"As he shall think by our true diligence\n"+
		"He is no less than what we say he is.\n"+
		"Lord\n"+
		"Take him up gently and to bed with him;\n"+
		"And each one to his office when he wakes.\n"+
		"Some bear out SLY. A trumpet sounds\n"+
		"Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds:\n"+
		"Exit Servingman\n"+
		"Belike, some noble gentleman that means,\n"+
		"Travelling some journey, to repose him here.\n"+
		"Re-enter Servingman\n"+
		"How now! who is it?\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"An't please your honour, players\n"+
		"That offer service to your lordship.\n"+
		"Lord\n"+
		"Bid them come near.\n"+
		"Enter Players\n"+
		"Now, fellows, you are welcome.\n"+
		"Players\n"+
		"We thank your honour.\n"+
		"Lord\n"+
		"Do you intend to stay with me tonight?\n"+
		"A Player\n"+
		"So please your lordship to accept our duty.\n"+
		"Lord\n"+
		"With all my heart. This fellow I remember,\n"+
		"Since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son:\n"+
		"'Twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well:\n"+
		"I have forgot your name; but, sure, that part\n"+
		"Was aptly fitted and naturally perform'd.\n"+
		"A Player\n"+
		"I think 'twas Soto that your honour means.\n"+
		"Lord\n"+
		"'Tis very true: thou didst it excellent.\n"+
		"Well, you are come to me in a happy time;\n"+
		"The rather for I have some sport in hand\n"+
		"Wherein your cunning can assist me much.\n"+
		"There is a lord will hear you play to-night:\n"+
		"But I am doubtful of your modesties;\n"+
		"Lest over-eyeing of his odd behavior,--\n"+
		"For yet his honour never heard a play--\n"+
		"You break into some merry passion\n"+
		"And so offend him; for I tell you, sirs,\n"+
		"If you should smile he grows impatient.\n"+
		"A Player\n"+
		"Fear not, my lord: we can contain ourselves,\n"+
		"Were he the veriest antic in the world.\n"+
		"Lord\n"+
		"Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery,\n"+
		"And give them friendly welcome every one:\n"+
		"Let them want nothing that my house affords.\n"+
		"Exit one with the Players\n"+
		"Sirrah, go you to Barthol'mew my page,\n"+
		"And see him dress'd in all suits like a lady:\n"+
		"That done, conduct him to the drunkard's chamber;\n"+
		"And call him 'madam,' do him obeisance.\n"+
		"Tell him from me, as he will win my love,\n"+
		"He bear himself with honourable action,\n"+
		"Such as he hath observed in noble ladies\n"+
		"Unto their lords, by them accomplished:\n"+
		"Such duty to the drunkard let him do\n"+
		"With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,\n"+
		"And say 'What is't your honour will command,\n"+
		"Wherein your lady and your humble wife\n"+
		"May show her duty and make known her love?'\n"+
		"And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses,\n"+
		"And with declining head into his bosom,\n"+
		"Bid him shed tears, as being overjoy'd\n"+
		"To see her noble lord restored to health,\n"+
		"Who for this seven years hath esteem'd him\n"+
		"No better than a poor and loathsome beggar:\n"+
		"And if the boy have not a woman's gift\n"+
		"To rain a shower of commanded tears,\n"+
		"An onion will do well for such a shift,\n"+
		"Which in a napkin being close convey'd\n"+
		"Shall in despite enforce a watery eye.\n"+
		"See this dispatch'd with all the haste thou canst:\n"+
		"Anon I'll give thee more instructions.\n"+
		"Exit a Servingman\n"+
		"I know the boy will well usurp the grace,\n"+
		"Voice, gait and action of a gentlewoman:\n"+
		"I long to hear him call the drunkard husband,\n"+
		"And how my men will stay themselves from laughter\n"+
		"When they do homage to this simple peasant.\n"+
		"I'll in to counsel them; haply my presence\n"+
		"May well abate the over-merry spleen\n"+
		"Which otherwise would grow into extremes.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. A bedchamber in the Lord's house.\n"+
		"Enter aloft SLY, with Attendants; some with apparel, others with basin and ewer and appurtenances; and Lord\n"+
		"SLY\n"+
		"For God's sake, a pot of small ale.\n"+
		"First Servant\n"+
		"Will't please your lordship drink a cup of sack?\n"+
		"Second Servant\n"+
		"Will't please your honour taste of these conserves?\n"+
		"Third Servant\n"+
		"What raiment will your honour wear to-day?\n"+
		"SLY\n"+
		"I am Christophero Sly; call not me 'honour' nor\n"+
		"'lordship:' I ne'er drank sack in my life; and if\n"+
		"you give me any conserves, give me conserves of\n"+
		"beef: ne'er ask me what raiment I'll wear; for I\n"+
		"have no more doublets than backs, no more stockings\n"+
		"than legs, nor no more shoes than feet; nay,\n"+
		"sometimes more feet than shoes, or such shoes as my\n"+
		"toes look through the over-leather.\n"+
		"Lord\n"+
		"Heaven cease this idle humour in your honour!\n"+
		"O, that a mighty man of such descent,\n"+
		"Of such possessions and so high esteem,\n"+
		"Should be infused with so foul a spirit!\n"+
		"SLY\n"+
		"What, would you make me mad? Am not I Christopher\n"+
		"Sly, old Sly's son of Burtonheath, by birth a\n"+
		"pedlar, by education a cardmaker, by transmutation a\n"+
		"bear-herd, and now by present profession a tinker?\n"+
		"Ask Marian Hacket, the fat ale-wife of Wincot, if\n"+
		"she know me not: if she say I am not fourteen pence\n"+
		"on the score for sheer ale, score me up for the\n"+
		"lyingest knave in Christendom. What! I am not\n"+
		"bestraught: here's--\n"+
		"Third Servant\n"+
		"O, this it is that makes your lady mourn!\n"+
		"Second Servant\n"+
		"O, this is it that makes your servants droop!\n"+
		"Lord\n"+
		"Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house,\n"+
		"As beaten hence by your strange lunacy.\n"+
		"O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth,\n"+
		"Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment\n"+
		"And banish hence these abject lowly dreams.\n"+
		"Look how thy servants do attend on thee,\n"+
		"Each in his office ready at thy beck.\n"+
		"Wilt thou have music? hark! Apollo plays,\n"+
		"Music\n"+
		"And twenty caged nightingales do sing:\n"+
		"Or wilt thou sleep? we'll have thee to a couch\n"+
		"Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed\n"+
		"On purpose trimm'd up for Semiramis.\n"+
		"Say thou wilt walk; we will bestrew the ground:\n"+
		"Or wilt thou ride? thy horses shall be trapp'd,\n"+
		"Their harness studded all with gold and pearl.\n"+
		"Dost thou love hawking? thou hast hawks will soar\n"+
		"Above the morning lark or wilt thou hunt?\n"+
		"Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them\n"+
		"And fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth.\n"+
		"First Servant\n"+
		"Say thou wilt course; thy greyhounds are as swift\n"+
		"As breathed stags, ay, fleeter than the roe.\n"+
		"Second Servant\n"+
		"Dost thou love pictures? we will fetch thee straight\n"+
		"Adonis painted by a running brook,\n"+
		"And Cytherea all in sedges hid,\n"+
		"Which seem to move and wanton with her breath,\n"+
		"Even as the waving sedges play with wind.\n"+
		"Lord\n"+
		"We'll show thee Io as she was a maid,\n"+
		"And how she was beguiled and surprised,\n"+
		"As lively painted as the deed was done.\n"+
		"Third Servant\n"+
		"Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood,\n"+
		"Scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds,\n"+
		"And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep,\n"+
		"So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.\n"+
		"Lord\n"+
		"Thou art a lord, and nothing but a lord:\n"+
		"Thou hast a lady far more beautiful\n"+
		"Than any woman in this waning age.\n"+
		"First Servant\n"+
		"And till the tears that she hath shed for thee\n"+
		"Like envious floods o'er-run her lovely face,\n"+
		"She was the fairest creature in the world;\n"+
		"And yet she is inferior to none.\n"+
		"SLY\n"+
		"Am I a lord? and have I such a lady?\n"+
		"Or do I dream? or have I dream'd till now?\n"+
		"I do not sleep: I see, I hear, I speak;\n"+
		"I smell sweet savours and I feel soft things:\n"+
		"Upon my life, I am a lord indeed\n"+
		"And not a tinker nor Christophero Sly.\n"+
		"Well, bring our lady hither to our sight;\n"+
		"And once again, a pot o' the smallest ale.\n"+
		"Second Servant\n"+
		"Will't please your mightiness to wash your hands?\n"+
		"O, how we joy to see your wit restored!\n"+
		"O, that once more you knew but what you are!\n"+
		"These fifteen years you have been in a dream;\n"+
		"Or when you waked, so waked as if you slept.\n"+
		"SLY\n"+
		"These fifteen years! by my fay, a goodly nap.\n"+
		"But did I never speak of all that time?\n"+
		"First Servant\n"+
		"O, yes, my lord, but very idle words:\n"+
		"For though you lay here in this goodly chamber,\n"+
		"Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door;\n"+
		"And rail upon the hostess of the house;\n"+
		"And say you would present her at the leet,\n"+
		"Because she brought stone jugs and no seal'd quarts:\n"+
		"Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket.\n"+
		"SLY\n"+
		"Ay, the woman's maid of the house.\n"+
		"Third Servant\n"+
		"Why, sir, you know no house nor no such maid,\n"+
		"Nor no such men as you have reckon'd up,\n"+
		"As Stephen Sly and did John Naps of Greece\n"+
		"And Peter Turph and Henry Pimpernell\n"+
		"And twenty more such names and men as these\n"+
		"Which never were nor no man ever saw.\n"+
		"SLY\n"+
		"Now Lord be thanked for my good amends!\n"+
		"ALL\n"+
		"Amen.\n"+
		"SLY\n"+
		"I thank thee: thou shalt not lose by it.\n"+
		"Enter the Page as a lady, with attendants\n"+
		"Page\n"+
		"How fares my noble lord?\n"+
		"SLY\n"+
		"Marry, I fare well for here is cheer enough.\n"+
		"Where is my wife?\n"+
		"Page\n"+
		"Here, noble lord: what is thy will with her?\n"+
		"SLY\n"+
		"Are you my wife and will not call me husband?\n"+
		"My men should call me 'lord:' I am your goodman.\n"+
		"Page\n"+
		"My husband and my lord, my lord and husband;\n"+
		"I am your wife in all obedience.\n"+
		"SLY\n"+
		"I know it well. What must I call her?\n"+
		"Lord\n"+
		"Madam.\n"+
		"SLY\n"+
		"Al'ce madam, or Joan madam?\n"+
		"Lord\n"+
		"'Madam,' and nothing else: so lords\n"+
		"call ladies.\n"+
		"SLY\n"+
		"Madam wife, they say that I have dream'd\n"+
		"And slept above some fifteen year or more.\n"+
		"Page\n"+
		"Ay, and the time seems thirty unto me,\n"+
		"Being all this time abandon'd from your bed.\n"+
		"SLY\n"+
		"'Tis much. Servants, leave me and her alone.\n"+
		"Madam, undress you and come now to bed.\n"+
		"Page\n"+
		"Thrice noble lord, let me entreat of you\n"+
		"To pardon me yet for a night or two,\n"+
		"Or, if not so, until the sun be set:\n"+
		"For your physicians have expressly charged,\n"+
		"In peril to incur your former malady,\n"+
		"That I should yet absent me from your bed:\n"+
		"I hope this reason stands for my excuse.\n"+
		"SLY\n"+
		"Ay, it stands so that I may hardly\n"+
		"tarry so long. But I would be loath to fall into\n"+
		"my dreams again: I will therefore tarry in\n"+
		"despite of the flesh and the blood.\n"+
		"Enter a Messenger\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"Your honour's players, heating your amendment,\n"+
		"Are come to play a pleasant comedy;\n"+
		"For so your doctors hold it very meet,\n"+
		"Seeing too much sadness hath congeal'd your blood,\n"+
		"And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy:\n"+
		"Therefore they thought it good you hear a play\n"+
		"And frame your mind to mirth and merriment,\n"+
		"Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life.\n"+
		"SLY\n"+
		"Marry, I will, let them play it. Is not a\n"+
		"comondy a Christmas gambold or a tumbling-trick?\n"+
		"Page\n"+
		"No, my good lord; it is more pleasing stuff.\n"+
		"SLY\n"+
		"What, household stuff?\n"+
		"Page\n"+
		"It is a kind of history.\n"+
		"SLY\n"+
		"Well, well see't. Come, madam wife, sit by my side\n"+
		"and let the world slip: we shall ne'er be younger.\n"+
		"Flourish\n"+
		"ACT I\n"+
		"SCENE I. Padua. A public place.\n"+
		"Enter LUCENTIO and his man TRANIO\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"Tranio, since for the great desire I had\n"+
		"To see fair Padua, nursery of arts,\n"+
		"I am arrived for fruitful Lombardy,\n"+
		"The pleasant garden of great Italy;\n"+
		"And by my father's love and leave am arm'd\n"+
		"With his good will and thy good company,\n"+
		"My trusty servant, well approved in all,\n"+
		"Here let us breathe and haply institute\n"+
		"A course of learning and ingenious studies.\n"+
		"Pisa renown'd for grave citizens\n"+
		"Gave me my being and my father first,\n"+
		"A merchant of great traffic through the world,\n"+
		"Vincetino come of Bentivolii.\n"+
		"Vincetino's son brought up in Florence\n"+
		"It shall become to serve all hopes conceived,\n"+
		"To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds:\n"+
		"And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study,\n"+
		"Virtue and that part of philosophy\n"+
		"Will I apply that treats of happiness\n"+
		"By virtue specially to be achieved.\n"+
		"Tell me thy mind; for I have Pisa left\n"+
		"And am to Padua come, as he that leaves\n"+
		"A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep\n"+
		"And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"Mi perdonato, gentle master mine,\n"+
		"I am in all affected as yourself;\n"+
		"Glad that you thus continue your resolve\n"+
		"To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.\n"+
		"Only, good master, while we do admire\n"+
		"This virtue and this moral discipline,\n"+
		"Let's be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray;\n"+
		"Or so devote to Aristotle's cheques\n"+
		"As Ovid be an outcast quite abjured:\n"+
		"Balk logic with acquaintance that you have\n"+
		"And practise rhetoric in your common talk;\n"+
		"Music and poesy use to quicken you;\n"+
		"The mathematics and the metaphysics,\n"+
		"Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you;\n"+
		"No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en:\n"+
		"In brief, sir, study what you most affect.\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise.\n"+
		"If, Biondello, thou wert come ashore,\n"+
		"We could at once put us in readiness,\n"+
		"And take a lodging fit to entertain\n"+
		"Such friends as time in Padua shall beget.\n"+
		"But stay a while: what company is this?\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"Master, some show to welcome us to town.\n"+
		"Enter BAPTISTA, KATHARINA, BIANCA, GREMIO, and HORTENSIO. LUCENTIO and TRANIO stand by\n"+
		"BAPTISTA\n"+
		"Gentlemen, importune me no farther,\n"+
		"For how I firmly am resolved you know;\n"+
		"That is, not bestow my youngest daughter\n"+
		"Before I have a husband for the elder:\n"+
		"If either of you both love Katharina,\n"+
		"Because I know you well and love you well,\n"+
		"Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure.\n"+
		"GREMIO\n"+
		"[Aside] To cart her rather: she's too rough for me.\n"+
		"There, There, Hortensio, will you any wife?\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"I pray you, sir, is it your will\n"+
		"To make a stale of me amongst these mates?\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"Mates, maid! how mean you that? no mates for you,\n"+
		"Unless you were of gentler, milder mould.\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"I'faith, sir, you shall never need to fear:\n"+
		"I wis it is not half way to her heart;\n"+
		"But if it were, doubt not her care should be\n"+
		"To comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool\n"+
		"And paint your face and use you like a fool.\n"+
		"HORTENSIA\n"+
		"From all such devils, good Lord deliver us!\n"+
		"GREMIO\n"+
		"And me too, good Lord!\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"Hush, master! here's some good pastime toward:\n"+
		"That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward.\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"But in the other's silence do I see\n"+
		"Maid's mild behavior and sobriety.\n"+
		"Peace, Tranio!\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"Well said, master; mum! and gaze your fill.\n"+
		"BAPTISTA\n"+
		"Gentlemen, that I may soon make good\n"+
		"What I have said, Bianca, get you in:\n"+
		"And let it not displease thee, good Bianca,\n"+
		"For I will love thee ne'er the less, my girl.\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"A pretty peat! it is best\n"+
		"Put finger in the eye, an she knew why.\n"+
		"BIANCA\n"+
		"Sister, content you in my discontent.\n"+
		"Sir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe:\n"+
		"My books and instruments shall be my company,\n"+
		"On them to took and practise by myself.\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"Hark, Tranio! thou may'st hear Minerva speak.\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"Signior Baptista, will you be so strange?\n"+
		"Sorry am I that our good will effects\n"+
		"Bianca's grief.\n"+
		"GREMIO\n"+
		"Why will you mew her up,\n"+
		"Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell,\n"+
		"And make her bear the penance of her tongue?\n"+
		"BAPTISTA\n"+
		"Gentlemen, content ye; I am resolved:\n"+
		"Go in, Bianca:\n"+
		"Exit BIANCA\n"+
		"And for I know she taketh most delight\n"+
		"In music, instruments and poetry,\n"+
		"Schoolmasters will I keep within my house,\n"+
		"Fit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio,\n"+
		"Or Signior Gremio, you, know any such,\n"+
		"Prefer them hither; for to cunning men\n"+
		"I will be very kind, and liberal\n"+
		"To mine own children in good bringing up:\n"+
		"And so farewell. Katharina, you may stay;\n"+
		"For I have more to commune with Bianca.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not? What,\n"+
		"shall I be appointed hours; as though, belike, I\n"+
		"knew not what to take and what to leave, ha?\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"GREMIO\n"+
		"You may go to the devil's dam: your gifts are so\n"+
		"good, here's none will hold you. Their love is not\n"+
		"so great, Hortensio, but we may blow our nails\n"+
		"together, and fast it fairly out: our cakes dough on\n"+
		"both sides. Farewell: yet for the love I bear my\n"+
		"sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit\n"+
		"man to teach her that wherein she delights, I will\n"+
		"wish him to her father.\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"So will I, Signior Gremio: but a word, I pray.\n"+
		"Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked\n"+
		"parle, know now, upon advice, it toucheth us both,\n"+
		"that we may yet again have access to our fair\n"+
		"mistress and be happy rivals in Bianco's love, to\n"+
		"labour and effect one thing specially.\n"+
		"GREMIO\n"+
		"What's that, I pray?\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.\n"+
		"GREMIO\n"+
		"A husband! a devil.\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"I say, a husband.\n"+
		"GREMIO\n"+
		"I say, a devil. Thinkest thou, Hortensio, though\n"+
		"her father be very rich, any man is so very a fool\n"+
		"to be married to hell?\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"Tush, Gremio, though it pass your patience and mine\n"+
		"to endure her loud alarums, why, man, there be good\n"+
		"fellows in the world, an a man could light on them,\n"+
		"would take her with all faults, and money enough.\n"+
		"GREMIO\n"+
		"I cannot tell; but I had as lief take her dowry with\n"+
		"this condition, to be whipped at the high cross\n"+
		"every morning.\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"Faith, as you say, there's small choice in rotten\n"+
		"apples. But come; since this bar in law makes us\n"+
		"friends, it shall be so far forth friendly\n"+
		"maintained all by helping Baptista's eldest daughter\n"+
		"to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband,\n"+
		"and then have to't a fresh. Sweet Bianca! Happy man\n"+
		"be his dole! He that runs fastest gets the ring.\n"+
		"How say you, Signior Gremio?\n"+
		"GREMIO\n"+
		"I am agreed; and would I had given him the best\n"+
		"horse in Padua to begin his wooing that would\n"+
		"thoroughly woo her, wed her and bed her and rid the\n"+
		"house of her! Come on.\n"+
		"Exeunt GREMIO and HORTENSIO\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible\n"+
		"That love should of a sudden take such hold?\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"O Tranio, till I found it to be true,\n"+
		"I never thought it possible or likely;\n"+
		"But see, while idly I stood looking on,\n"+
		"I found the effect of love in idleness:\n"+
		"And now in plainness do confess to thee,\n"+
		"That art to me as secret and as dear\n"+
		"As Anna to the queen of Carthage was,\n"+
		"Tranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio,\n"+
		"If I achieve not this young modest girl.\n"+
		"Counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst;\n"+
		"Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt.\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"Master, it is no time to chide you now;\n"+
		"Affection is not rated from the heart:\n"+
		"If love have touch'd you, nought remains but so,\n"+
		"'Redime te captum quam queas minimo.'\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"Gramercies, lad, go forward; this contents:\n"+
		"The rest will comfort, for thy counsel's sound.\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"Master, you look'd so longly on the maid,\n"+
		"Perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all.\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"O yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,\n"+
		"Such as the daughter of Agenor had,\n"+
		"That made great Jove to humble him to her hand.\n"+
		"When with his knees he kiss'd the Cretan strand.\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"Saw you no more? mark'd you not how her sister\n"+
		"Began to scold and raise up such a storm\n"+
		"That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move\n"+
		"And with her breath she did perfume the air:\n"+
		"Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"Nay, then, 'tis time to stir him from his trance.\n"+
		"I pray, awake, sir: if you love the maid,\n"+
		"Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:\n"+
		"Her eldest sister is so curst and shrewd\n"+
		"That till the father rid his hands of her,\n"+
		"Master, your love must live a maid at home;\n"+
		"And therefore has he closely mew'd her up,\n"+
		"Because she will not be annoy'd with suitors.\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father's he!\n"+
		"But art thou not advised, he took some care\n"+
		"To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"Ay, marry, am I, sir; and now 'tis plotted.\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"I have it, Tranio.\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"Master, for my hand,\n"+
		"Both our inventions meet and jump in one.\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"Tell me thine first.\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"You will be schoolmaster\n"+
		"And undertake the teaching of the maid:\n"+
		"That's your device.\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"It is: may it be done?\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"Not possible; for who shall bear your part,\n"+
		"And be in Padua here Vincentio's son,\n"+
		"Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,\n"+
		"Visit his countrymen and banquet them?\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"Basta; content thee, for I have it full.\n"+
		"We have not yet been seen in any house,\n"+
		"Nor can we lie distinguish'd by our faces\n"+
		"For man or master; then it follows thus;\n"+
		"Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,\n"+
		"Keep house and port and servants as I should:\n"+
		"I will some other be, some Florentine,\n"+
		"Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa.\n"+
		"'Tis hatch'd and shall be so: Tranio, at once\n"+
		"Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak:\n"+
		"When Biondello comes, he waits on thee;\n"+
		"But I will charm him first to keep his tongue.\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"So had you need.\n"+
		"In brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is,\n"+
		"And I am tied to be obedient;\n"+
		"For so your father charged me at our parting,\n"+
		"'Be serviceable to my son,' quoth he,\n"+
		"Although I think 'twas in another sense;\n"+
		"I am content to be Lucentio,\n"+
		"Because so well I love Lucentio.\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"Tranio, be so, because Lucentio loves:\n"+
		"And let me be a slave, to achieve that maid\n"+
		"Whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye.\n"+
		"Here comes the rogue.\n"+
		"Enter BIONDELLO\n"+
		"Sirrah, where have you been?\n"+
		"BIONDELLO\n"+
		"Where have I been! Nay, how now! where are you?\n"+
		"Master, has my fellow Tranio stolen your clothes? Or\n"+
		"you stolen his? or both? pray, what's the news?\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"Sirrah, come hither: 'tis no time to jest,\n"+
		"And therefore frame your manners to the time.\n"+
		"Your fellow Tranio here, to save my life,\n"+
		"Puts my apparel and my countenance on,\n"+
		"And I for my escape have put on his;\n"+
		"For in a quarrel since I came ashore\n"+
		"I kill'd a man and fear I was descried:\n"+
		"Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,\n"+
		"While I make way from hence to save my life:\n"+
		"You understand me?\n"+
		"BIONDELLO\n"+
		"I, sir! ne'er a whit.\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth:\n"+
		"Tranio is changed into Lucentio.\n"+
		"BIONDELLO\n"+
		"The better for him: would I were so too!\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"So could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after,\n"+
		"That Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youngest daughter.\n"+
		"But, sirrah, not for my sake, but your master's, I advise\n"+
		"You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies:\n"+
		"When I am alone, why, then I am Tranio;\n"+
		"But in all places else your master Lucentio.\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"Tranio, let's go: one thing more rests, that\n"+
		"thyself execute, to make one among these wooers: if\n"+
		"thou ask me why, sufficeth, my reasons are both good\n"+
		"and weighty.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"The presenters above speak\n"+
		"First Servant\n"+
		"My lord, you nod; you do not mind the play.\n"+
		"SLY\n"+
		"Yes, by Saint Anne, do I. A good matter, surely:\n"+
		"comes there any more of it?\n"+
		"Page\n"+
		"My lord, 'tis but begun.\n"+
		"SLY\n"+
		"'Tis a very excellent piece of work, madam lady:\n"+
		"would 'twere done!\n"+
		"They sit and mark\n"+
		"SCENE II. Padua. Before HORTENSIO'S house.\n"+
		"Enter PETRUCHIO and his man GRUMIO\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Verona, for a while I take my leave,\n"+
		"To see my friends in Padua, but of all\n"+
		"My best beloved and approved friend,\n"+
		"Hortensio; and I trow this is his house.\n"+
		"Here, sirrah Grumio; knock, I say.\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"Knock, sir! whom should I knock? is there man has\n"+
		"rebused your worship?\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Villain, I say, knock me here soundly.\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"Knock you here, sir! why, sir, what am I, sir, that\n"+
		"I should knock you here, sir?\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Villain, I say, knock me at this gate\n"+
		"And rap me well, or I'll knock your knave's pate.\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"My master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock\n"+
		"you first,\n"+
		"And then I know after who comes by the worst.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Will it not be?\n"+
		"Faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock, I'll ring it;\n"+
		"I'll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it.\n"+
		"He wrings him by the ears\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"Help, masters, help! my master is mad.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Now, knock when I bid you, sirrah villain!\n"+
		"Enter HORTENSIO\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"How now! what's the matter? My old friend Grumio!\n"+
		"and my good friend Petruchio! How do you all at Verona?\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?\n"+
		"'Con tutto il cuore, ben trovato,' may I say.\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"'Alla nostra casa ben venuto, molto honorato signor\n"+
		"mio Petruchio.' Rise, Grumio, rise: we will compound\n"+
		"this quarrel.\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"Nay, 'tis no matter, sir, what he 'leges in Latin.\n"+
		"if this be not a lawful case for me to leave his\n"+
		"service, look you, sir, he bid me knock him and rap\n"+
		"him soundly, sir: well, was it fit for a servant to\n"+
		"use his master so, being perhaps, for aught I see,\n"+
		"two and thirty, a pip out? Whom would to God I had\n"+
		"well knock'd at first, Then had not Grumio come by the worst.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"A senseless villain! Good Hortensio,\n"+
		"I bade the rascal knock upon your gate\n"+
		"And could not get him for my heart to do it.\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"Knock at the gate! O heavens! Spake you not these\n"+
		"words plain, 'Sirrah, knock me here, rap me here,\n"+
		"knock me well, and knock me soundly'? And come you\n"+
		"now with, 'knocking at the gate'?\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"Petruchio, patience; I am Grumio's pledge:\n"+
		"Why, this's a heavy chance 'twixt him and you,\n"+
		"Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.\n"+
		"And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale\n"+
		"Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Such wind as scatters young men through the world,\n"+
		"To seek their fortunes farther than at home\n"+
		"Where small experience grows. But in a few,\n"+
		"Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:\n"+
		"Antonio, my father, is deceased;\n"+
		"And I have thrust myself into this maze,\n"+
		"Haply to wive and thrive as best I may:\n"+
		"Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home,\n"+
		"And so am come abroad to see the world.\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee\n"+
		"And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife?\n"+
		"Thou'ldst thank me but a little for my counsel:\n"+
		"And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich\n"+
		"And very rich: but thou'rt too much my friend,\n"+
		"And I'll not wish thee to her.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Signior Hortensio, 'twixt such friends as we\n"+
		"Few words suffice; and therefore, if thou know\n"+
		"One rich enough to be Petruchio's wife,\n"+
		"As wealth is burden of my wooing dance,\n"+
		"Be she as foul as was Florentius' love,\n"+
		"As old as Sibyl and as curst and shrewd\n"+
		"As Socrates' Xanthippe, or a worse,\n"+
		"She moves me not, or not removes, at least,\n"+
		"Affection's edge in me, were she as rough\n"+
		"As are the swelling Adriatic seas:\n"+
		"I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;\n"+
		"If wealthily, then happily in Padua.\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his\n"+
		"mind is: Why give him gold enough and marry him to\n"+
		"a puppet or an aglet-baby; or an old trot with ne'er\n"+
		"a tooth in her head, though she have as many diseases\n"+
		"as two and fifty horses: why, nothing comes amiss,\n"+
		"so money comes withal.\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"Petruchio, since we are stepp'd thus far in,\n"+
		"I will continue that I broach'd in jest.\n"+
		"I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife\n"+
		"With wealth enough and young and beauteous,\n"+
		"Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman:\n"+
		"Her only fault, and that is faults enough,\n"+
		"Is that she is intolerable curst\n"+
		"And shrewd and froward, so beyond all measure\n"+
		"That, were my state far worser than it is,\n"+
		"I would not wed her for a mine of gold.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Hortensio, peace! thou know'st not gold's effect:\n"+
		"Tell me her father's name and 'tis enough;\n"+
		"For I will board her, though she chide as loud\n"+
		"As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"Her father is Baptista Minola,\n"+
		"An affable and courteous gentleman:\n"+
		"Her name is Katharina Minola,\n"+
		"Renown'd in Padua for her scolding tongue.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"I know her father, though I know not her;\n"+
		"And he knew my deceased father well.\n"+
		"I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her;\n"+
		"And therefore let me be thus bold with you\n"+
		"To give you over at this first encounter,\n"+
		"Unless you will accompany me thither.\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"I pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts.\n"+
		"O' my word, an she knew him as well as I do, she\n"+
		"would think scolding would do little good upon him:\n"+
		"she may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so:\n"+
		"why, that's nothing; an he begin once, he'll rail in\n"+
		"his rope-tricks. I'll tell you what sir, an she\n"+
		"stand him but a little, he will throw a figure in\n"+
		"her face and so disfigure her with it that she\n"+
		"shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat.\n"+
		"You know him not, sir.\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee,\n"+
		"For in Baptista's keep my treasure is:\n"+
		"He hath the jewel of my life in hold,\n"+
		"His youngest daughter, beautiful Binaca,\n"+
		"And her withholds from me and other more,\n"+
		"Suitors to her and rivals in my love,\n"+
		"Supposing it a thing impossible,\n"+
		"For those defects I have before rehearsed,\n"+
		"That ever Katharina will be woo'd;\n"+
		"Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en,\n"+
		"That none shall have access unto Bianca\n"+
		"Till Katharina the curst have got a husband.\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"Katharina the curst!\n"+
		"A title for a maid of all titles the worst.\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace,\n"+
		"And offer me disguised in sober robes\n"+
		"To old Baptista as a schoolmaster\n"+
		"Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca;\n"+
		"That so I may, by this device, at least\n"+
		"Have leave and leisure to make love to her\n"+
		"And unsuspected court her by herself.\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"Here's no knavery! See, to beguile the old folks,\n"+
		"how the young folks lay their heads together!\n"+
		"Enter GREMIO, and LUCENTIO disguised\n"+
		"Master, master, look about you: who goes there, ha?\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"Peace, Grumio! it is the rival of my love.\n"+
		"Petruchio, stand by a while.\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"A proper stripling and an amorous!\n"+
		"GREMIO\n"+
		"O, very well; I have perused the note.\n"+
		"Hark you, sir: I'll have them very fairly bound:\n"+
		"All books of love, see that at any hand;\n"+
		"And see you read no other lectures to her:\n"+
		"You understand me: over and beside\n"+
		"Signior Baptista's liberality,\n"+
		"I'll mend it with a largess. Take your paper too,\n"+
		"And let me have them very well perfumed\n"+
		"For she is sweeter than perfume itself\n"+
		"To whom they go to. What will you read to her?\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"Whate'er I read to her, I'll plead for you\n"+
		"As for my patron, stand you so assured,\n"+
		"As firmly as yourself were still in place:\n"+
		"Yea, and perhaps with more successful words\n"+
		"Than you, unless you were a scholar, sir.\n"+
		"GREMIO\n"+
		"O this learning, what a thing it is!\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"O this woodcock, what an ass it is!\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Peace, sirrah!\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"Grumio, mum! God save you, Signior Gremio.\n"+
		"GREMIO\n"+
		"And you are well met, Signior Hortensio.\n"+
		"Trow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola.\n"+
		"I promised to inquire carefully\n"+
		"About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca:\n"+
		"And by good fortune I have lighted well\n"+
		"On this young man, for learning and behavior\n"+
		"Fit for her turn, well read in poetry\n"+
		"And other books, good ones, I warrant ye.\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"'Tis well; and I have met a gentleman\n"+
		"Hath promised me to help me to another,\n"+
		"A fine musician to instruct our mistress;\n"+
		"So shall I no whit be behind in duty\n"+
		"To fair Bianca, so beloved of me.\n"+
		"GREMIO\n"+
		"Beloved of me; and that my deeds shall prove.\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"And that his bags shall prove.\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"Gremio, 'tis now no time to vent our love:\n"+
		"Listen to me, and if you speak me fair,\n"+
		"I'll tell you news indifferent good for either.\n"+
		"Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met,\n"+
		"Upon agreement from us to his liking,\n"+
		"Will undertake to woo curst Katharina,\n"+
		"Yea, and to marry her, if her dowry please.\n"+
		"GREMIO\n"+
		"So said, so done, is well.\n"+
		"Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"I know she is an irksome brawling scold:\n"+
		"If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.\n"+
		"GREMIO\n"+
		"No, say'st me so, friend? What countryman?\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Born in Verona, old Antonio's son:\n"+
		"My father dead, my fortune lives for me;\n"+
		"And I do hope good days and long to see.\n"+
		"GREMIO\n"+
		"O sir, such a life, with such a wife, were strange!\n"+
		"But if you have a stomach, to't i' God's name:\n"+
		"You shall have me assisting you in all.\n"+
		"But will you woo this wild-cat?\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Will I live?\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"Will he woo her? ay, or I'll hang her.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Why came I hither but to that intent?\n"+
		"Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?\n"+
		"Have I not in my time heard lions roar?\n"+
		"Have I not heard the sea puff'd up with winds\n"+
		"Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?\n"+
		"Have I not heard great ordnance in the field,\n"+
		"And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies?\n"+
		"Have I not in a pitched battle heard\n"+
		"Loud 'larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets' clang?\n"+
		"And do you tell me of a woman's tongue,\n"+
		"That gives not half so great a blow to hear\n"+
		"As will a chestnut in a farmer's fire?\n"+
		"Tush, tush! fear boys with bugs.\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"For he fears none.\n"+
		"GREMIO\n"+
		"Hortensio, hark:\n"+
		"This gentleman is happily arrived,\n"+
		"My mind presumes, for his own good and ours.\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"I promised we would be contributors\n"+
		"And bear his charging of wooing, whatsoe'er.\n"+
		"GREMIO\n"+
		"And so we will, provided that he win her.\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"I would I were as sure of a good dinner.\n"+
		"Enter TRANIO brave, and BIONDELLO\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"Gentlemen, God save you. If I may be bold,\n"+
		"Tell me, I beseech you, which is the readiest way\n"+
		"To the house of Signior Baptista Minola?\n"+
		"BIONDELLO\n"+
		"He that has the two fair daughters: is't he you mean?\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"Even he, Biondello.\n"+
		"GREMIO\n"+
		"Hark you, sir; you mean not her to--\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"Perhaps, him and her, sir: what have you to do?\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Not her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray.\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"I love no chiders, sir. Biondello, let's away.\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"Well begun, Tranio.\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"Sir, a word ere you go;\n"+
		"Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of, yea or no?\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"And if I be, sir, is it any offence?\n"+
		"GREMIO\n"+
		"No; if without more words you will get you hence.\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"Why, sir, I pray, are not the streets as free\n"+
		"For me as for you?\n"+
		"GREMIO\n"+
		"But so is not she.\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"For what reason, I beseech you?\n"+
		"GREMIO\n"+
		"For this reason, if you'll know,\n"+
		"That she's the choice love of Signior Gremio.\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"That she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio.\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"Softly, my masters! if you be gentlemen,\n"+
		"Do me this right; hear me with patience.\n"+
		"Baptista is a noble gentleman,\n"+
		"To whom my father is not all unknown;\n"+
		"And were his daughter fairer than she is,\n"+
		"She may more suitors have and me for one.\n"+
		"Fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers;\n"+
		"Then well one more may fair Bianca have:\n"+
		"And so she shall; Lucentio shall make one,\n"+
		"Though Paris came in hope to speed alone.\n"+
		"GREMIO\n"+
		"What! this gentleman will out-talk us all.\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"Sir, give him head: I know he'll prove a jade.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Hortensio, to what end are all these words?\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"Sir, let me be so bold as ask you,\n"+
		"Did you yet ever see Baptista's daughter?\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"No, sir; but hear I do that he hath two,\n"+
		"The one as famous for a scolding tongue\n"+
		"As is the other for beauteous modesty.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Sir, sir, the first's for me; let her go by.\n"+
		"GREMIO\n"+
		"Yea, leave that labour to great Hercules;\n"+
		"And let it be more than Alcides' twelve.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Sir, understand you this of me in sooth:\n"+
		"The younges t daughter whom you hearken for\n"+
		"Her father keeps from all access of suitors,\n"+
		"And will not promise her to any man\n"+
		"Until the elder sister first be wed:\n"+
		"The younger then is free and not before.\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"If it be so, sir, that you are the man\n"+
		"Must stead us all and me amongst the rest,\n"+
		"And if you break the ice and do this feat,\n"+
		"Achieve the elder, set the younger free\n"+
		"For our access, whose hap shall be to have her\n"+
		"Will not so graceless be to be ingrate.\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"Sir, you say well and well you do conceive;\n"+
		"And since you do profess to be a suitor,\n"+
		"You must, as we do, gratify this gentleman,\n"+
		"To whom we all rest generally beholding.\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"Sir, I shall not be slack: in sign whereof,\n"+
		"Please ye we may contrive this afternoon,\n"+
		"And quaff carouses to our mistress' health,\n"+
		"And do as adversaries do in law,\n"+
		"Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"BIONDELLO\n"+
		"O excellent motion! Fellows, let's be gone.\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"The motion's good indeed and be it so,\n"+
		"Petruchio, I shall be your ben venuto.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT II\n"+
		"SCENE I. Padua. A room in BAPTISTA'S house.\n"+
		"Enter KATHARINA and BIANCA\n"+
		"BIANCA\n"+
		"Good sister, wrong me not, nor wrong yourself,\n"+
		"To make a bondmaid and a slave of me;\n"+
		"That I disdain: but for these other gawds,\n"+
		"Unbind my hands, I'll pull them off myself,\n"+
		"Yea, all my raiment, to my petticoat;\n"+
		"Or what you will command me will I do,\n"+
		"So well I know my duty to my elders.\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"Of all thy suitors, here I charge thee, tell\n"+
		"Whom thou lovest best: see thou dissemble not.\n"+
		"BIANCA\n"+
		"Believe me, sister, of all the men alive\n"+
		"I never yet beheld that special face\n"+
		"Which I could fancy more than any other.\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"Minion, thou liest. Is't not Hortensio?\n"+
		"BIANCA\n"+
		"If you affect him, sister, here I swear\n"+
		"I'll plead for you myself, but you shall have\n"+
		"him.\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"O then, belike, you fancy riches more:\n"+
		"You will have Gremio to keep you fair.\n"+
		"BIANCA\n"+
		"Is it for him you do envy me so?\n"+
		"Nay then you jest, and now I well perceive\n"+
		"You have but jested with me all this while:\n"+
		"I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands.\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"If that be jest, then all the rest was so.\n"+
		"Strikes her\n"+
		"Enter BAPTISTA\n"+
		"BAPTISTA\n"+
		"Why, how now, dame! whence grows this insolence?\n"+
		"Bianca, stand aside. Poor girl! she weeps.\n"+
		"Go ply thy needle; meddle not with her.\n"+
		"For shame, thou helding of a devilish spirit,\n"+
		"Why dost thou wrong her that did ne'er wrong thee?\n"+
		"When did she cross thee with a bitter word?\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"Her silence flouts me, and I'll be revenged.\n"+
		"Flies after BIANCA\n"+
		"BAPTISTA\n"+
		"What, in my sight? Bianca, get thee in.\n"+
		"Exit BIANCA\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"What, will you not suffer me? Nay, now I see\n"+
		"She is your treasure, she must have a husband;\n"+
		"I must dance bare-foot on her wedding day\n"+
		"And for your love to her lead apes in hell.\n"+
		"Talk not to me: I will go sit and weep\n"+
		"Till I can find occasion of revenge.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"BAPTISTA\n"+
		"Was ever gentleman thus grieved as I?\n"+
		"But who comes here?\n"+
		"Enter GREMIO, LUCENTIO in the habit of a mean man; PETRUCHIO, with HORTENSIO as a musician; and TRANIO, with BIONDELLO bearing a lute and books\n"+
		"GREMIO\n"+
		"Good morrow, neighbour Baptista.\n"+
		"BAPTISTA\n"+
		"Good morrow, neighbour Gremio.\n"+
		"God save you, gentlemen!\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"And you, good sir! Pray, have you not a daughter\n"+
		"Call'd Katharina, fair and virtuous?\n"+
		"BAPTISTA\n"+
		"I have a daughter, sir, called Katharina.\n"+
		"GREMIO\n"+
		"You are too blunt: go to it orderly.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"You wrong me, Signior Gremio: give me leave.\n"+
		"I am a gentleman of Verona, sir,\n"+
		"That, hearing of her beauty and her wit,\n"+
		"Her affability and bashful modesty,\n"+
		"Her wondrous qualities and mild behavior,\n"+
		"Am bold to show myself a forward guest\n"+
		"Within your house, to make mine eye the witness\n"+
		"Of that report which I so oft have heard.\n"+
		"And, for an entrance to my entertainment,\n"+
		"I do present you with a man of mine,\n"+
		"Presenting HORTENSIO\n"+
		"Cunning in music and the mathematics,\n"+
		"To instruct her fully in those sciences,\n"+
		"Whereof I know she is not ignorant:\n"+
		"Accept of him, or else you do me wrong:\n"+
		"His name is Licio, born in Mantua.\n"+
		"BAPTISTA\n"+
		"You're welcome, sir; and he, for your good sake.\n"+
		"But for my daughter Katharina, this I know,\n"+
		"She is not for your turn, the more my grief.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"I see you do not mean to part with her,\n"+
		"Or else you like not of my company.\n"+
		"BAPTISTA\n"+
		"Mistake me not; I speak but as I find.\n"+
		"Whence are you, sir? what may I call your name?\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Petruchio is my name; Antonio's son,\n"+
		"A man well known throughout all Italy.\n"+
		"BAPTISTA\n"+
		"I know him well: you are welcome for his sake.\n"+
		"GREMIO\n"+
		"Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray,\n"+
		"Let us, that are poor petitioners, speak too:\n"+
		"Baccare! you are marvellous forward.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"O, pardon me, Signior Gremio; I would fain be doing.\n"+
		"GREMIO\n"+
		"I doubt it not, sir; but you will curse your\n"+
		"wooing. Neighbour, this is a gift very grateful, I am\n"+
		"sure of it. To express the like kindness, myself,\n"+
		"that have been more kindly beholding to you than\n"+
		"any, freely give unto you this young scholar,\n"+
		"Presenting LUCENTIO\n"+
		"that hath been long studying at Rheims; as cunning\n"+
		"in Greek, Latin, and other languages, as the other\n"+
		"in music and mathematics: his name is Cambio; pray,\n"+
		"accept his service.\n"+
		"BAPTISTA\n"+
		"A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio.\n"+
		"Welcome, good Cambio.\n"+
		"To TRANIO\n"+
		"But, gentle sir, methinks you walk like a stranger:\n"+
		"may I be so bold to know the cause of your coming?\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own,\n"+
		"That, being a stranger in this city here,\n"+
		"Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,\n"+
		"Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.\n"+
		"Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me,\n"+
		"In the preferment of the eldest sister.\n"+
		"This liberty is all that I request,\n"+
		"That, upon knowledge of my parentage,\n"+
		"I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo\n"+
		"And free access and favour as the rest:\n"+
		"And, toward the education of your daughters,\n"+
		"I here bestow a simple instrument,\n"+
		"And this small packet of Greek and Latin books:\n"+
		"If you accept them, then their worth is great.\n"+
		"BAPTISTA\n"+
		"Lucentio is your name; of whence, I pray?\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"Of Pisa, sir; son to Vincentio.\n"+
		"BAPTISTA\n"+
		"A mighty man of Pisa; by report\n"+
		"I know him well: you are very welcome, sir,\n"+
		"Take you the lute, and you the set of books;\n"+
		"You shall go see your pupils presently.\n"+
		"Holla, within!\n"+
		"Enter a Servant\n"+
		"Sirrah, lead these gentlemen\n"+
		"To my daughters; and tell them both,\n"+
		"These are their tutors: bid them use them well.\n"+
		"Exit Servant, with LUCENTIO and HORTENSIO, BIONDELLO following\n"+
		"We will go walk a little in the orchard,\n"+
		"And then to dinner. You are passing welcome,\n"+
		"And so I pray you all to think yourselves.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste,\n"+
		"And every day I cannot come to woo.\n"+
		"You knew my father well, and in him me,\n"+
		"Left solely heir to all his lands and goods,\n"+
		"Which I have better'd rather than decreased:\n"+
		"Then tell me, if I get your daughter's love,\n"+
		"What dowry shall I have with her to wife?\n"+
		"BAPTISTA\n"+
		"After my death the one half of my lands,\n"+
		"And in possession twenty thousand crowns.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"And, for that dowry, I'll assure her of\n"+
		"Her widowhood, be it that she survive me,\n"+
		"In all my lands and leases whatsoever:\n"+
		"Let specialties be therefore drawn between us,\n"+
		"That covenants may be kept on either hand.\n"+
		"BAPTISTA\n"+
		"Ay, when the special thing is well obtain'd,\n"+
		"That is, her love; for that is all in all.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Why, that is nothing: for I tell you, father,\n"+
		"I am as peremptory as she proud-minded;\n"+
		"And where two raging fires meet together\n"+
		"They do consume the thing that feeds their fury:\n"+
		"Though little fire grows great with little wind,\n"+
		"Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all:\n"+
		"So I to her and so she yields to me;\n"+
		"For I am rough and woo not like a babe.\n"+
		"BAPTISTA\n"+
		"Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed!\n"+
		"But be thou arm'd for some unhappy words.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Ay, to the proof; as mountains are for winds,\n"+
		"That shake not, though they blow perpetually.\n"+
		"Re-enter HORTENSIO, with his head broke\n"+
		"BAPTISTA\n"+
		"How now, my friend! why dost thou look so pale?\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.\n"+
		"BAPTISTA\n"+
		"What, will my daughter prove a good musician?\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"I think she'll sooner prove a soldier\n"+
		"Iron may hold with her, but never lutes.\n"+
		"BAPTISTA\n"+
		"Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"Why, no; for she hath broke the lute to me.\n"+
		"I did but tell her she mistook her frets,\n"+
		"And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering;\n"+
		"When, with a most impatient devilish spirit,\n"+
		"'Frets, call you these?' quoth she; 'I'll fume\n"+
		"with them:'\n"+
		"And, with that word, she struck me on the head,\n"+
		"And through the instrument my pate made way;\n"+
		"And there I stood amazed for a while,\n"+
		"As on a pillory, looking through the lute;\n"+
		"While she did call me rascal fiddler\n"+
		"And twangling Jack; with twenty such vile terms,\n"+
		"As had she studied to misuse me so.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench;\n"+
		"I love her ten times more than e'er I did:\n"+
		"O, how I long to have some chat with her!\n"+
		"BAPTISTA\n"+
		"Well, go with me and be not so discomfited:\n"+
		"Proceed in practise with my younger daughter;\n"+
		"She's apt to learn and thankful for good turns.\n"+
		"Signior Petruchio, will you go with us,\n"+
		"Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"I pray you do.\n"+
		"Exeunt all but PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"I will attend her here,\n"+
		"And woo her with some spirit when she comes.\n"+
		"Say that she rail; why then I'll tell her plain\n"+
		"She sings as sweetly as a nightingale:\n"+
		"Say that she frown, I'll say she looks as clear\n"+
		"As morning roses newly wash'd with dew:\n"+
		"Say she be mute and will not speak a word;\n"+
		"Then I'll commend her volubility,\n"+
		"And say she uttereth piercing eloquence:\n"+
		"If she do bid me pack, I'll give her thanks,\n"+
		"As though she bid me stay by her a week:\n"+
		"If she deny to wed, I'll crave the day\n"+
		"When I shall ask the banns and when be married.\n"+
		"But here she comes; and now, Petruchio, speak.\n"+
		"Enter KATHARINA\n"+
		"Good morrow, Kate; for that's your name, I hear.\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing:\n"+
		"They call me Katharina that do talk of me.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"You lie, in faith; for you are call'd plain Kate,\n"+
		"And bonny Kate and sometimes Kate the curst;\n"+
		"But Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom\n"+
		"Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate,\n"+
		"For dainties are all Kates, and therefore, Kate,\n"+
		"Take this of me, Kate of my consolation;\n"+
		"Hearing thy mildness praised in every town,\n"+
		"Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded,\n"+
		"Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs,\n"+
		"Myself am moved to woo thee for my wife.\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"Moved! in good time: let him that moved you hither\n"+
		"Remove you hence: I knew you at the first\n"+
		"You were a moveable.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Why, what's a moveable?\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"A join'd-stool.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Thou hast hit it: come, sit on me.\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"Asses are made to bear, and so are you.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Women are made to bear, and so are you.\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"No such jade as you, if me you mean.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Alas! good Kate, I will not burden thee;\n"+
		"For, knowing thee to be but young and light--\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"Too light for such a swain as you to catch;\n"+
		"And yet as heavy as my weight should be.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Should be! should--buzz!\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"Well ta'en, and like a buzzard.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"O slow-wing'd turtle! shall a buzzard take thee?\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Come, come, you wasp; i' faith, you are too angry.\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"If I be waspish, best beware my sting.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"My remedy is then, to pluck it out.\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies,\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Who knows not where a wasp does\n"+
		"wear his sting? In his tail.\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"In his tongue.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Whose tongue?\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"Yours, if you talk of tails: and so farewell.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"What, with my tongue in your tail? nay, come again,\n"+
		"Good Kate; I am a gentleman.\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"That I'll try.\n"+
		"She strikes him\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"I swear I'll cuff you, if you strike again.\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"So may you lose your arms:\n"+
		"If you strike me, you are no gentleman;\n"+
		"And if no gentleman, why then no arms.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy books!\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"What is your crest? a coxcomb?\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"No cock of mine; you crow too like a craven.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Nay, come, Kate, come; you must not look so sour.\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"It is my fashion, when I see a crab.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Why, here's no crab; and therefore look not sour.\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"There is, there is.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Then show it me.\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"Had I a glass, I would.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"What, you mean my face?\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"Well aim'd of such a young one.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you.\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"Yet you are wither'd.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"'Tis with cares.\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"I care not.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Nay, hear you, Kate: in sooth you scape not so.\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"I chafe you, if I tarry: let me go.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"No, not a whit: I find you passing gentle.\n"+
		"'Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen,\n"+
		"And now I find report a very liar;\n"+
		"For thou are pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,\n"+
		"But slow in speech, yet sweet as spring-time flowers:\n"+
		"Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance,\n"+
		"Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will,\n"+
		"Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk,\n"+
		"But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers,\n"+
		"With gentle conference, soft and affable.\n"+
		"Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?\n"+
		"O slanderous world! Kate like the hazel-twig\n"+
		"Is straight and slender and as brown in hue\n"+
		"As hazel nuts and sweeter than the kernels.\n"+
		"O, let me see thee walk: thou dost not halt.\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"Go, fool, and whom thou keep'st command.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Did ever Dian so become a grove\n"+
		"As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?\n"+
		"O, be thou Dian, and let her be Kate;\n"+
		"And then let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful!\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"Where did you study all this goodly speech?\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"It is extempore, from my mother-wit.\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"A witty mother! witless else her son.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Am I not wise?\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"Yes; keep you warm.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Marry, so I mean, sweet Katharina, in thy bed:\n"+
		"And therefore, setting all this chat aside,\n"+
		"Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented\n"+
		"That you shall be my wife; your dowry 'greed on;\n"+
		"And, Will you, nill you, I will marry you.\n"+
		"Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn;\n"+
		"For, by this light, whereby I see thy beauty,\n"+
		"Thy beauty, that doth make me like thee well,\n"+
		"Thou must be married to no man but me;\n"+
		"For I am he am born to tame you Kate,\n"+
		"And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate\n"+
		"Conformable as other household Kates.\n"+
		"Here comes your father: never make denial;\n"+
		"I must and will have Katharina to my wife.\n"+
		"Re-enter BAPTISTA, GREMIO, and TRANIO\n"+
		"BAPTISTA\n"+
		"Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my daughter?\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"How but well, sir? how but well?\n"+
		"It were impossible I should speed amiss.\n"+
		"BAPTISTA\n"+
		"Why, how now, daughter Katharina! in your dumps?\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"Call you me daughter? now, I promise you\n"+
		"You have show'd a tender fatherly regard,\n"+
		"To wish me wed to one half lunatic;\n"+
		"A mad-cup ruffian and a swearing Jack,\n"+
		"That thinks with oaths to face the matter out.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Father, 'tis thus: yourself and all the world,\n"+
		"That talk'd of her, have talk'd amiss of her:\n"+
		"If she be curst, it is for policy,\n"+
		"For she's not froward, but modest as the dove;\n"+
		"She is not hot, but temperate as the morn;\n"+
		"For patience she will prove a second Grissel,\n"+
		"And Roman Lucrece for her chastity:\n"+
		"And to conclude, we have 'greed so well together,\n"+
		"That upon Sunday is the wedding-day.\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first.\n"+
		"GREMIO\n"+
		"Hark, Petruchio; she says she'll see thee\n"+
		"hang'd first.\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"Is this your speeding? nay, then, good night our part!\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Be patient, gentlemen; I choose her for myself:\n"+
		"If she and I be pleased, what's that to you?\n"+
		"'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain, being alone,\n"+
		"That she shall still be curst in company.\n"+
		"I tell you, 'tis incredible to believe\n"+
		"How much she loves me: O, the kindest Kate!\n"+
		"She hung about my neck; and kiss on kiss\n"+
		"She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath,\n"+
		"That in a twink she won me to her love.\n"+
		"O, you are novices! 'tis a world to see,\n"+
		"How tame, when men and women are alone,\n"+
		"A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.\n"+
		"Give me thy hand, Kate: I will unto Venice,\n"+
		"To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding-day.\n"+
		"Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests;\n"+
		"I will be sure my Katharina shall be fine.\n"+
		"BAPTISTA\n"+
		"I know not what to say: but give me your hands;\n"+
		"God send you joy, Petruchio! 'tis a match.\n"+
		"GREMIO\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"Amen, say we: we will be witnesses.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu;\n"+
		"I will to Venice; Sunday comes apace:\n"+
		"We will have rings and things and fine array;\n"+
		"And kiss me, Kate, we will be married o'Sunday.\n"+
		"Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHARINA severally\n"+
		"GREMIO\n"+
		"Was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly?\n"+
		"BAPTISTA\n"+
		"Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant's part,\n"+
		"And venture madly on a desperate mart.\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"'Twas a commodity lay fretting by you:\n"+
		"'Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas.\n"+
		"BAPTISTA\n"+
		"The gain I seek is, quiet in the match.\n"+
		"GREMIO\n"+
		"No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.\n"+
		"But now, Baptists, to your younger daughter:\n"+
		"Now is the day we long have looked for:\n"+
		"I am your neighbour, and was suitor first.\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"And I am one that love Bianca more\n"+
		"Than words can witness, or your thoughts can guess.\n"+
		"GREMIO\n"+
		"Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"Graybeard, thy love doth freeze.\n"+
		"GREMIO\n"+
		"But thine doth fry.\n"+
		"Skipper, stand back: 'tis age that nourisheth.\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"But youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth.\n"+
		"BAPTISTA\n"+
		"Content you, gentlemen: I will compound this strife:\n"+
		"'Tis deeds must win the prize; and he of both\n"+
		"That can assure my daughter greatest dower\n"+
		"Shall have my Bianca's love.\n"+
		"Say, Signior Gremio, What can you assure her?\n"+
		"GREMIO\n"+
		"First, as you know, my house within the city\n"+
		"Is richly furnished with plate and gold;\n"+
		"Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands;\n"+
		"My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry;\n"+
		"In ivory coffers I have stuff'd my crowns;\n"+
		"In cypress chests my arras counterpoints,\n"+
		"Costly apparel, tents, and canopies,\n"+
		"Fine linen, Turkey cushions boss'd with pearl,\n"+
		"Valance of Venice gold in needlework,\n"+
		"Pewter and brass and all things that belong\n"+
		"To house or housekeeping: then, at my farm\n"+
		"I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,\n"+
		"Sixscore fat oxen standing in my stalls,\n"+
		"And all things answerable to this portion.\n"+
		"Myself am struck in years, I must confess;\n"+
		"And if I die to-morrow, this is hers,\n"+
		"If whilst I live she will be only mine.\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"That 'only' came well in. Sir, list to me:\n"+
		"I am my father's heir and only son:\n"+
		"If I may have your daughter to my wife,\n"+
		"I'll leave her houses three or four as good,\n"+
		"Within rich Pisa walls, as any one\n"+
		"Old Signior Gremio has in Padua;\n"+
		"Besides two thousand ducats by the year\n"+
		"Of fruitful land, all which shall be her jointure.\n"+
		"What, have I pinch'd you, Signior Gremio?\n"+
		"GREMIO\n"+
		"Two thousand ducats by the year of land!\n"+
		"My land amounts not to so much in all:\n"+
		"That she shall have; besides an argosy\n"+
		"That now is lying in Marseilles' road.\n"+
		"What, have I choked you with an argosy?\n"+

		"Gremio, 'tis known my father hath no less\n"+
		"Than three great argosies; besides two galliases,\n"+
		"And twelve tight galleys: these I will assure her,\n"+
		"And twice as much, whate'er thou offer'st next.\n"+
		"GREMIO\n"+
		"Nay, I have offer'd all, I have no more;\n"+
		"And she can have no more than all I have:\n"+
		"If you like me, she shall have me and mine.\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"Why, then the maid is mine from all the world,\n"+
		"By your firm promise: Gremio is out-vied.\n"+
		"BAPTISTA\n"+
		"I must confess your offer is the best;\n"+
		"And, let your father make her the assurance,\n"+
		"She is your own; else, you must pardon me,\n"+
		"if you should die before him, where's her dower?\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"That's but a cavil: he is old, I young.\n"+
		"GREMIO\n"+

		"BAPTISTA\n"+
		"Well, gentlemen,\n"+
		"I am thus resolved: on Sunday next you know\n"+
		"My daughter Katharina is to be married:\n"+
		"Now, on the Sunday following, shall Bianca\n"+
		"Be bride to you, if you this assurance;\n"+
		"If not, Signior Gremio:\n"+
		"And so, I take my leave, and thank you both.\n"+
		"GREMIO\n"+
		"Adieu, good neighbour.\n"+
		"Exit BAPTISTA\n"+
		"Now I fear thee not:\n"+
		"Sirrah young gamester, your father were a fool\n"+
		"To give thee all, and in his waning age\n"+
		"Set foot under thy table: tut, a toy!\n"+
		"An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"A vengeance on your crafty wither'd hide!\n"+
		"Yet I have faced it with a card of ten.\n"+
		"'Tis in my head to do my master good:\n"+
		"I see no reason but supposed Lucentio\n"+
		"Must get a father, call'd 'supposed Vincentio;'\n"+
		"And that's a wonder: fathers commonly\n"+

		"A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"ACT III\n"+
		"SCENE I. Padua. BAPTISTA'S house.\n"+
		"Enter LUCENTIO, HORTENSIO, and BIANCA\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"Fiddler, forbear; you grow too forward, sir:\n"+
		"Have you so soon forgot the entertainment\n"+
		"Her sister Katharina welcomed you withal?\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"But, wrangling pedant, this is\n"+
		"The patroness of heavenly harmony:\n"+
		"Then give me leave to have prerogative;\n"+
		"And when in music we have spent an hour,\n"+
		"Your lecture shall have leisure for as much.\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"Preposterous ass, that never read so far\n"+
		"To know the cause why music was ordain'd!\n"+
		"Was it not to refresh the mind of man\n"+
		"After his studies or his usual pain?\n"+
		"Then give me leave to read philosophy,\n"+
		"And while I pause, serve in your harmony.\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine.\n"+
		"BIANCA\n"+
		"Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong,\n"+
		"To strive for that which resteth in my choice:\n"+
		"I am no breeching scholar in the schools;\n"+
		"I'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times,\n"+
		"But learn my lessons as I please myself.\n"+
		"And, to cut off all strife, here sit we down:\n"+
		"Take you your instrument, play you the whiles;\n"+
		"His lecture will be done ere you have tuned.\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"That will be never: tune your instrument.\n"+
		"BIANCA\n"+
		"Where left we last?\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"Here, madam:\n"+
		"'Hic ibat Simois; hic est Sigeia tellus;\n"+

		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"Madam, my instrument's in tune.\n"+
		"BIANCA\n"+
		"Let's hear. O fie! the treble jars.\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"Spit in the hole, man, and tune again.\n"+
		"BIANCA\n"+
		"Now let me see if I can construe it: 'Hic ibat\n"+
		"Simois,' I know you not, 'hic est Sigeia tellus,' I\n"+
		"trust you not; 'Hic steterat Priami,' take heed\n"+
		"he hear us not, 'regia,' presume not, 'celsa senis,'\n"+
		"despair not.\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"Madam, 'tis now in tune.\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"All but the base.\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"The base is right; 'tis the base knave that jars.\n"+
		"Aside\n"+
		"How fiery and forward our pedant is!\n"+
		"Now, for my life, the knave doth court my love:\n"+
		"Pedascule, I'll watch you better yet.\n"+
		"BIANCA\n"+
		"In time I may believe, yet I mistrust.\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"Mistrust it not: for, sure, AEacides\n"+
		"Was Ajax, call'd so from his grandfather.\n"+
		"BIANCA\n"+
		"I must believe my master; else, I promise you,\n"+
		"I should be arguing still upon that doubt:\n"+
		"But let it rest. Now, Licio, to you:\n"+
		"Good masters, take it not unkindly, pray,\n"+
		"That I have been thus pleasant with you both.\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"You may go walk, and give me leave a while:\n"+
		"My lessons make no music in three parts.\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"Are you so formal, sir? well, I must wait,\n"+
		"Aside\n"+
		"And watch withal; for, but I be deceived,\n"+
		"Our fine musician groweth amorous.\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"Madam, before you touch the instrument,\n"+
		"To learn the order of my fingering,\n"+
		"I must begin with rudiments of art;\n"+
		"To teach you gamut in a briefer sort,\n"+
		"More pleasant, pithy and effectual,\n"+
		"Than hath been taught by any of my trade:\n"+
		"And there it is in writing, fairly drawn.\n"+
		"BIANCA\n"+
		"Why, I am past my gamut long ago.\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+

		"Call you this gamut? tut, I like it not:\n"+
		"Old fashions please me best; I am not so nice,\n"+
		"To change true rules for old inventions.\n"+
		"Enter a Servant\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"Mistress, your father prays you leave your books\n"+
		"And help to dress your sister's chamber up:\n"+
		"You know to-morrow is the wedding-day.\n"+
		"BIANCA\n"+
		"Farewell, sweet masters both; I must be gone.\n"+
		"Exeunt BIANCA and Servant\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"Faith, mistress, then I have no cause to stay.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"But I have cause to pry into this pedant:\n"+
		"Methinks he looks as though he were in love:\n"+
		"Yet if thy thoughts, Bianca, be so humble\n"+
		"To cast thy wandering eyes on every stale,\n"+
		"Seize thee that list: if once I find thee ranging,\n"+
		"Hortensio will be quit with thee by changing.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE II. Padua. Before BAPTISTA'S house.\n"+

		"BAPTISTA\n"+
		"[To TRANIO] Signior Lucentio, this is the\n"+

		"To want the bridegroom when the priest attends\n"+
		"To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage!\n"+
		"What says Lucentio to this shame of ours?\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"No shame but mine: I must, forsooth, be forced\n"+
		"To give my hand opposed against my heart\n"+
		"Unto a mad-brain rudesby full of spleen;\n"+
		"Who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure.\n"+
		"I told you, I, he was a frantic fool,\n"+
		"Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behavior:\n"+
		"And, to be noted for a merry man,\n"+
		"He'll woo a thousand, 'point the day of marriage,\n"+
		"Make feasts, invite friends, and proclaim the banns;\n"+
		"Yet never means to wed where he hath woo'd.\n"+
		"Now must the world point at poor Katharina,\n"+

		"BIONDELLO\n"+
		"Master, master! news, old news, and such news as\n"+

		"But say, what to thine old news?\n"+
		"BIONDELLO\n"+
		"Why, Petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old\n"+
		"jerkin, a pair of old breeches thrice turned, a pair\n"+
		"of boots that have been candle-cases, one buckled,\n"+
		"another laced, an old rusty sword ta'en out of the\n"+
		"town-armory, with a broken hilt, and chapeless;\n"+
		"with two broken points: his horse hipped with an\n"+
		"old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred;\n"+
		"besides, possessed with the glanders and like to mose\n"+
		"in the chine; troubled with the lampass, infected\n"+
		"with the fashions, full of wingdalls, sped with\n"+
		"spavins, rayed with yellows, past cure of the fives,\n"+
		"stark spoiled with the staggers, begnawn with the\n"+
		"bots, swayed in the back and shoulder-shotten;\n"+
		"near-legged before and with, a half-chequed bit\n"+
		"and a head-stall of sheeps leather which, being\n"+
		"restrained to keep him from stumbling, hath been\n"+
		"often burst and now repaired with knots; one girth\n"+
		"six time pieced and a woman's crupper of velure,\n"+
		"which hath two letters for her name fairly set down\n"+
		"in studs, and here and there pieced with packthread.\n"+
		"BAPTISTA\n"+
		"Who comes with him?\n"+
		"BIONDELLO\n"+
		"O, sir, his lackey, for all the world caparisoned\n"+
		"like the horse; with a linen stock on one leg and a\n"+
		"kersey boot-hose on the other, gartered with a red\n"+
		"and blue list; an old hat and 'the humour of forty\n"+
		"fancies' pricked in't for a feather: a monster, a\n"+
		"very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian\n"+
		"footboy or a gentleman's lackey.\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"'Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion;\n"+

		"Who? that Petruchio came?\n"+
		"BAPTISTA\n"+
		"Ay, that Petruchio came.\n"+
		"BIONDELLO\n"+
		"No, sir, I say his horse comes, with him on his back.\n"+
		"BAPTISTA\n"+
		"Why, that's all one.\n"+
		"BIONDELLO\n"+
		"Nay, by Saint Jamy,\n"+
		"I hold you a penny,\n"+
		"A horse and a man\n"+
		"Is more than one,\n"+

		"But where is Kate? where is my lovely bride?\n"+
		"How does my father? Gentles, methinks you frown:\n"+
		"And wherefore gaze this goodly company,\n"+
		"As if they saw some wondrous monument,\n"+
		"Some comet or unusual prodigy?\n"+
		"BAPTISTA\n"+
		"Why, sir, you know this is your wedding-day:\n"+
		"First were we sad, fearing you would not come;\n"+
		"Now sadder, that you come so unprovided.\n"+
		"Fie, doff this habit, shame to your estate,\n"+
		"An eye-sore to our solemn festival!\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"And tells us, what occasion of import\n"+
		"Hath all so long detain'd you from your wife,\n"+
		"And sent you hither so unlike yourself?\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Tedious it were to tell, and harsh to hear:\n"+

		"Though in some part enforced to digress;\n"+
		"Which, at more leisure, I will so excuse\n"+
		"As you shall well be satisfied withal.\n"+

		"Not I, believe me: thus I'll visit her.\n"+
		"BAPTISTA\n"+
		"But thus, I trust, you will not marry her.\n"+

		"Good sooth, even thus; therefore ha' done with words:\n"+
		"To me she's married, not unto my clothes:\n"+
		"Could I repair what she will wear in me,\n"+
		"As I can change these poor accoutrements,\n"+
		"'Twere well for Kate and better for myself.\n"+

		"And seal the title with a lovely kiss!\n"+

		"And watch our vantage in this business:\n"+
		"We'll over-reach the greybeard, Gremio,\n"+
		"The narrow-prying father, Minola,\n"+

		"Why he's a devil, a devil, a very fiend.\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"Why, she's a devil, a devil, the devil's dam.\n"+
		"GREMIO\n"+
		"Tut, she's a lamb, a dove, a fool to him!\n"+
		"I'll tell you, Sir Lucentio: when the priest\n"+
		"Should ask, if Katharina should be his wife,\n"+
		"'Ay, by gogs-wouns,' quoth he; and swore so loud,\n"+
		"That, all-amazed, the priest let fall the book;\n"+
		"And, as he stoop'd again to take it up,\n"+
		"The mad-brain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff\n"+
		"That down fell priest and book and book and priest:\n"+
		"'Now take them up,' quoth he, 'if any list.'\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"What said the wench when he rose again?\n"+
		"GREMIO\n"+
		"Trembled and shook; for why, he stamp'd and swore,\n"+
		"As if the vicar meant to cozen him.\n"+
		"But after many ceremonies done,\n"+
		"He calls for wine: 'A health!' quoth he, as if\n"+
		"He had been aboard, carousing to his mates\n"+
		"After a storm; quaff'd off the muscadel\n"+
		"And threw the sops all in the sexton's face;\n"+
		"Having no other reason\n"+
		"But that his beard grew thin and hungerly\n"+
		"And seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking.\n"+
		"This done, he took the bride about the neck\n"+
		"And kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack\n"+
		"That at the parting all the church did echo:\n"+
		"And I seeing this came thence for very shame;\n"+
		"And after me, I know, the rout is coming.\n"+
		"Such a mad marriage never was before:\n"+
		"Hark, hark! I hear the minstrels play.\n"+

		"hot, my very lips might freeze to my teeth, my\n"+
		"tongue to the roof of my mouth, my heart in my\n"+
		"belly, ere I should come by a fire to thaw me: but\n"+
		"I, with blowing the fire, shall warm myself; for,\n"+
		"considering the weather, a taller man than I will\n"+
		"take cold. Holla, ho! Curtis.\n"+
		"Enter CURTIS\n"+
		"CURTIS\n"+
		"Who is that calls so coldly?\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"A piece of ice: if thou doubt it, thou mayst slide\n"+
		"from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run\n"+
		"but my head and my neck. A fire good Curtis.\n"+
		"CURTIS\n"+
		"Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio?\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"O, ay, Curtis, ay: and therefore fire, fire; cast\n"+
		"on no water.\n"+
		"CURTIS\n"+
		"Is she so hot a shrew as she's reported?\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"She was, good Curtis, before this frost: but, thou\n"+
		"knowest, winter tames man, woman and beast; for it\n"+
		"hath tamed my old master and my new mistress and\n"+
		"myself, fellow Curtis.\n"+
		"CURTIS\n"+
		"Away, you three-inch fool! I am no beast.\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"Am I but three inches? why, thy horn is a foot; and\n"+
		"so long am I at the least. But wilt thou make a\n"+
		"fire, or shall I complain on thee to our mistress,\n"+
		"whose hand, she being now at hand, thou shalt soon\n"+
		"feel, to thy cold comfort, for being slow in thy hot office?\n"+
		"CURTIS\n"+
		"I prithee, good Grumio, tell me, how goes the world?\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"A cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine; and\n"+
		"therefore fire: do thy duty, and have thy duty; for\n"+
		"my master and mistress are almost frozen to death.\n"+
		"CURTIS\n"+
		"There's fire ready; and therefore, good Grumio, the news.\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"Why, 'Jack, boy! ho! boy!' and as much news as\n"+
		"will thaw.\n"+
		"CURTIS\n"+
		"Come, you are so full of cony-catching!\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"Why, therefore fire; for I have caught extreme cold.\n"+
		"Where's the cook? is supper ready, the house\n"+
		"trimmed, rushes strewed, cobwebs swept; the\n"+
		"serving-men in their new fustian, their white\n"+
		"stockings, and every officer his wedding-garment on?\n"+
		"Be the jacks fair within, the jills fair without,\n"+
		"the carpets laid, and every thing in order?\n"+
		"CURTIS\n"+
		"All ready; and therefore, I pray thee, news.\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"First, know, my horse is tired; my master and\n"+
		"mistress fallen out.\n"+
		"CURTIS\n"+
		"How?\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"Out of their saddles into the dirt; and thereby\n"+
		"hangs a tale.\n"+
		"CURTIS\n"+
		"Let's ha't, good Grumio.\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"Lend thine ear.\n"+
		"CURTIS\n"+
		"Here.\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"There.\n"+
		"Strikes him\n"+
		"CURTIS\n"+
		"This is to feel a tale, not to hear a tale.\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"And therefore 'tis called a sensible tale: and this\n"+
		"cuff was but to knock at your ear, and beseech\n"+
		"listening. Now I begin: Imprimis, we came down a\n"+
		"foul hill, my master riding behind my mistress,--\n"+
		"CURTIS\n"+
		"Both of one horse?\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"What's that to thee?\n"+
		"CURTIS\n"+
		"Why, a horse.\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"Tell thou the tale: but hadst thou not crossed me,\n"+
		"thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell and she\n"+
		"under her horse; thou shouldst have heard in how\n"+
		"miry a place, how she was bemoiled, how he left her\n"+
		"with the horse upon her, how he beat me because\n"+
		"her horse stumbled, how she waded through the dirt\n"+
		"to pluck him off me, how he swore, how she prayed,\n"+
		"that never prayed before, how I cried, how the\n"+
		"horses ran away, how her bridle was burst, how I\n"+
		"lost my crupper, with many things of worthy memory,\n"+
		"which now shall die in oblivion and thou return\n"+
		"unexperienced to thy grave.\n"+
		"CURTIS\n"+
		"By this reckoning he is more shrew than she.\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"Ay; and that thou and the proudest of you all shall\n"+
		"find when he comes home. But what talk I of this?\n"+
		"Call forth Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip,\n"+
		"Walter, Sugarsop and the rest: let their heads be\n"+
		"sleekly combed their blue coats brushed and their\n"+
		"garters of an indifferent knit: let them curtsy\n"+
		"with their left legs and not presume to touch a hair\n"+
		"of my master's horse-tail till they kiss their\n"+
		"hands. Are they all ready?\n"+
		"CURTIS\n"+
		"They are.\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"Call them forth.\n"+
		"CURTIS\n"+
		"Do you hear, ho? you must meet my master to\n"+
		"countenance my mistress.\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"Why, she hath a face of her own.\n"+
		"CURTIS\n"+
		"Who knows not that?\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"Thou, it seems, that calls for company to\n"+
		"countenance her.\n"+
		"CURTIS\n"+
		"I call them forth to credit her.\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"Why, she comes to borrow nothing of them.\n"+
		"Enter four or five Serving-men\n"+

		"you;--and thus much for greeting. Now, my spruce\n"+
		"companions, is all ready, and all things neat?\n"+
		"NATHANIEL\n"+
		"All things is ready. How near is our master?\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"E'en at hand, alighted by this; and therefore be\n"+
		"not--Cock's passion, silence! I hear my master.\n"+
		"Enter PETRUCHIO and KATHARINA\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Where be these knaves? What, no man at door\n"+

		"Here, sir; as foolish as I was before.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"You peasant swain! you whoreson malt-horse drudge!\n"+
		"Did I not bid thee meet me in the park,\n"+
		"And bring along these rascal knaves with thee?\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"Nathaniel's coat, sir, was not fully made,\n"+
		"And Gabriel's pumps were all unpink'd i' the heel;\n"+
		"There was no link to colour Peter's hat,\n"+
		"And Walter's dagger was not come from sheathing:\n"+
		"There were none fine but Adam, Ralph, and Gregory;\n"+
		"The rest were ragged, old, and beggarly;\n"+
		"Yet, as they are, here are they come to meet you.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Go, rascals, go, and fetch my supper in.\n"+
		"Exeunt Servants\n"+

		"Take that, and mend the plucking off the other.\n"+
		"Strikes him\n"+
		"Be merry, Kate. Some water, here; what, ho!\n"+
		"Where's my spaniel Troilus? Sirrah, get you hence,\n"+
		"And bid my cousin Ferdinand come hither:\n"+

		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"I tell thee, Kate, 'twas burnt and dried away;\n"+
		"And I expressly am forbid to touch it,\n"+
		"For it engenders choler, planteth anger;\n"+
		"And better 'twere that both of us did fast,\n"+
		"Since, of ourselves, ourselves are choleric,\n"+
		"Than feed it with such over-roasted flesh.\n"+
		"Be patient; to-morrow 't shall be mended,\n"+
		"And, for this night, we'll fast for company:\n"+

		"CURTIS\n"+
		"In her chamber, making a sermon of continency to her;\n"+

		"To make her come and know her keeper's call,\n"+
		"That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites\n"+
		"That bate and beat and will not be obedient.\n"+
		"She eat no meat to-day, nor none shall eat;\n"+
		"Last night she slept not, nor to-night she shall not;\n"+
		"As with the meat, some undeserved fault\n"+
		"I'll find about the making of the bed;\n"+
		"And here I'll fling the pillow, there the bolster,\n"+
		"This way the coverlet, another way the sheets:\n"+
		"Ay, and amid this hurly I intend\n"+
		"That all is done in reverend care of her;\n"+
		"And in conclusion she shall watch all night:\n"+
		"And if she chance to nod I'll rail and brawl\n"+
		"And with the clamour keep her still awake.\n"+

		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"Now, mistress, profit you in what you read?\n"+
		"BIANCA\n"+
		"What, master, read you? first resolve me that.\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"I read that I profess, the Art to Love.\n"+
		"BIANCA\n"+
		"And may you prove, sir, master of your art!\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"While you, sweet dear, prove mistress of my heart!\n"+

		"Quick proceeders, marry! Now, tell me, I pray,\n"+
		"You that durst swear at your mistress Bianca\n"+
		"Loved none in the world so well as Lucentio.\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"O despiteful love! unconstant womankind!\n"+
		"I tell thee, Licio, this is wonderful.\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"Mistake no more: I am not Licio,\n"+
		"Nor a musician, as I seem to be;\n"+
		"But one that scorn to live in this disguise,\n"+
		"For such a one as leaves a gentleman,\n"+
		"And makes a god of such a cullion:\n"+
		"Know, sir, that I am call'd Hortensio.\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"Signior Hortensio, I have often heard\n"+
		"Of your entire affection to Bianca;\n"+
		"And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness,\n"+
		"I will with you, if you be so contented,\n"+
		"Forswear Bianca and her love for ever.\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"See, how they kiss and court! Signior Lucentio,\n"+
		"Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow\n"+
		"Never to woo her no more, but do forswear her,\n"+
		"As one unworthy all the former favours\n"+
		"That I have fondly flatter'd her withal.\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"And here I take the unfeigned oath,\n"+
		"Never to marry with her though she would entreat:\n"+
		"Fie on her! see, how beastly she doth court him!\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"Would all the world but he had quite forsworn!\n"+
		"For me, that I may surely keep mine oath,\n"+
		"I will be married to a wealthy widow,\n"+
		"Ere three days pass, which hath as long loved me\n"+
		"As I have loved this proud disdainful haggard.\n"+
		"And so farewell, Signior Lucentio.\n"+
		"Kindness in women, not their beauteous looks,\n"+

		"Tranio, you jest: but have you both forsworn me?\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"Mistress, we have.\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+

		"He says so, Tranio.\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"Faith, he is gone unto the taming-school.\n"+
		"BIANCA\n"+
		"The taming-school! what, is there such a place?\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"Ay, mistress, and Petruchio is the master;\n"+
		"That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long,\n"+
		"To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue.\n"+
		"Enter BIONDELLO\n"+
		"BIONDELLO\n"+
		"O master, master, I have watch'd so long\n"+
		"That I am dog-weary: but at last I spied\n"+
		"An ancient angel coming down the hill,\n"+
		"Will serve the turn.\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"What is he, Biondello?\n"+
		"BIONDELLO\n"+
		"Master, a mercatante, or a pedant,\n"+
		"I know not what; but format in apparel,\n"+
		"In gait and countenance surely like a father.\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"And what of him, Tranio?\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"If he be credulous and trust my tale,\n"+
		"I'll make him glad to seem Vincentio,\n"+
		"And give assurance to Baptista Minola,\n"+
		"As if he were the right Vincentio\n"+
		"Take in your love, and then let me alone.\n"+
		"Exeunt LUCENTIO and BIANCA\n"+
		"Enter a Pedant\n"+
		"Pedant\n"+
		"God save you, sir!\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"And you, sir! you are welcome.\n"+
		"Travel you far on, or are you at the farthest?\n"+
		"Pedant\n"+
		"Sir, at the farthest for a week or two:\n"+
		"But then up farther, and as for as Rome;\n"+
		"And so to Tripoli, if God lend me life.\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"What countryman, I pray?\n"+
		"Pedant\n"+
		"Of Mantua.\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"Of Mantua, sir? marry, God forbid!\n"+
		"And come to Padua, careless of your life?\n"+
		"Pedant\n"+
		"My life, sir! how, I pray? for that goes hard.\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"'Tis death for any one in Mantua\n"+
		"To come to Padua. Know you not the cause?\n"+
		"Your ships are stay'd at Venice, and the duke,\n"+
		"For private quarrel 'twixt your duke and him,\n"+
		"Hath publish'd and proclaim'd it openly:\n"+
		"'Tis, marvel, but that you are but newly come,\n"+
		"You might have heard it else proclaim'd about.\n"+
		"Pedant\n"+
		"Alas! sir, it is worse for me than so;\n"+
		"For I have bills for money by exchange\n"+
		"From Florence and must here deliver them.\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"Well, sir, to do you courtesy,\n"+
		"This will I do, and this I will advise you:\n"+
		"First, tell me, have you ever been at Pisa?\n"+
		"Pedant\n"+
		"Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been,\n"+
		"Pisa renowned for grave citizens.\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"Among them know you one Vincentio?\n"+
		"Pedant\n"+
		"I know him not, but I have heard of him;\n"+
		"A merchant of incomparable wealth.\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"He is my father, sir; and, sooth to say,\n"+
		"In countenance somewhat doth resemble you.\n"+
		"BIONDELLO\n"+
		"[Aside] As much as an apple doth an oyster,\n"+
		"and all one.\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"To save your life in this extremity,\n"+
		"This favour will I do you for his sake;\n"+
		"And think it not the worst of an your fortunes\n"+
		"That you are like to Sir Vincentio.\n"+
		"His name and credit shall you undertake,\n"+
		"And in my house you shall be friendly lodged:\n"+
		"Look that you take upon you as you should;\n"+
		"You understand me, sir: so shall you stay\n"+
		"Till you have done your business in the city:\n"+
		"If this be courtesy, sir, accept of it.\n"+
		"Pedant\n"+
		"O sir, I do; and will repute you ever\n"+
		"The patron of my life and liberty.\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"Then go with me to make the matter good.\n"+
		"This, by the way, I let you understand;\n"+
		"my father is here look'd for every day,\n"+
		"To pass assurance of a dower in marriage\n"+
		"'Twixt me and one Baptista's daughter here:\n"+
		"In all these circumstances I'll instruct you:\n"+
		"Go with me to clothe you as becomes you.\n"+

		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"No, no, forsooth; I dare not for my life.\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"The more my wrong, the more his spite appears:\n"+
		"What, did he marry me to famish me?\n"+
		"Beggars, that come unto my father's door,\n"+
		"Upon entreaty have a present aims;\n"+
		"If not, elsewhere they meet with charity:\n"+
		"But I, who never knew how to entreat,\n"+
		"Nor never needed that I should entreat,\n"+
		"Am starved for meat, giddy for lack of sleep,\n"+
		"With oath kept waking and with brawling fed:\n"+
		"And that which spites me more than all these wants,\n"+
		"He does it under name of perfect love;\n"+
		"As who should say, if I should sleep or eat,\n"+
		"'Twere deadly sickness or else present death.\n"+
		"I prithee go and get me some repast;\n"+
		"I care not what, so it be wholesome food.\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"What say you to a neat's foot?\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"'Tis passing good: I prithee let me have it.\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"I fear it is too choleric a meat.\n"+
		"How say you to a fat tripe finely broil'd?\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"I like it well: good Grumio, fetch it me.\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"I cannot tell; I fear 'tis choleric.\n"+
		"What say you to a piece of beef and mustard?\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"A dish that I do love to feed upon.\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"Ay, but the mustard is too hot a little.\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"Why then, the beef, and let the mustard rest.\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"Nay then, I will not: you shall have the mustard,\n"+
		"Or else you get no beef of Grumio.\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"Then both, or one, or any thing thou wilt.\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"Why then, the mustard without the beef.\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"Go, get thee gone, thou false deluding slave,\n"+
		"Beats him\n"+
		"That feed'st me with the very name of meat:\n"+

		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"Faith, as cold as can be.\n"+

		"What, not a word? Nay, then thou lovest it not;\n"+
		"And all my pains is sorted to no proof.\n"+
		"Here, take away this dish.\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"I pray you, let it stand.\n"+

		"Haberdasher\n"+
		"Here is the cap your worship did bespeak.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Why, this was moulded on a porringer;\n"+
		"A velvet dish: fie, fie! 'tis lewd and filthy:\n"+
		"Why, 'tis a cockle or a walnut-shell,\n"+
		"A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby's cap:\n"+
		"Away with it! come, let me have a bigger.\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"I'll have no bigger: this doth fit the time,\n"+
		"And gentlewomen wear such caps as these\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"When you are gentle, you shall have one too,\n"+
		"And not till then.\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"[Aside] That will not be in haste.\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"Why, sir, I trust I may have leave to speak;\n"+
		"And speak I will; I am no child, no babe:\n"+
		"Your betters have endured me say my mind,\n"+
		"And if you cannot, best you stop your ears.\n"+
		"My tongue will tell the anger of my heart,\n"+
		"Or else my heart concealing it will break,\n"+
		"And rather than it shall, I will be free\n"+
		"Even to the uttermost, as I please, in words.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Why, thou say'st true; it is a paltry cap,\n"+
		"A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie:\n"+
		"I love thee well, in that thou likest it not.\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"Love me or love me not, I like the cap;\n"+
		"And it I will have, or I will have none.\n"+
		"Exit Haberdasher\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Thy gown? why, ay: come, tailor, let us see't.\n"+
		"O mercy, God! what masquing stuff is here?\n"+
		"What's this? a sleeve? 'tis like a demi-cannon:\n"+
		"What, up and down, carved like an apple-tart?\n"+
		"Here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash,\n"+
		"Like to a censer in a barber's shop:\n"+
		"Why, what, i' devil's name, tailor, call'st thou this?\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"[Aside] I see she's like to have neither cap nor gown.\n"+
		"Tailor\n"+
		"You bid me make it orderly and well,\n"+
		"According to the fashion and the time.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Marry, and did; but if you be remember'd,\n"+
		"I did not bid you mar it to the time.\n"+
		"Go, hop me over every kennel home,\n"+
		"For you shall hop without my custom, sir:\n"+
		"I'll none of it: hence! make your best of it.\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"I never saw a better-fashion'd gown,\n"+
		"More quaint, more pleasing, nor more commendable:\n"+
		"Belike you mean to make a puppet of me.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Why, true; he means to make a puppet of thee.\n"+
		"Tailor\n"+
		"She says your worship means to make\n"+
		"a puppet of her.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"O monstrous arrogance! Thou liest, thou thread,\n"+
		"thou thimble,\n"+
		"Thou yard, three-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail!\n"+
		"Thou flea, thou nit, thou winter-cricket thou!\n"+
		"Braved in mine own house with a skein of thread?\n"+
		"Away, thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant;\n"+
		"Or I shall so be-mete thee with thy yard\n"+
		"As thou shalt think on prating whilst thou livest!\n"+
		"I tell thee, I, that thou hast marr'd her gown.\n"+
		"Tailor\n"+
		"Your worship is deceived; the gown is made\n"+
		"Just as my master had direction:\n"+
		"Grumio gave order how it should be done.\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"I gave him no order; I gave him the stuff.\n"+
		"Tailor\n"+
		"But how did you desire it should be made?\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"Marry, sir, with needle and thread.\n"+
		"Tailor\n"+
		"But did you not request to have it cut?\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"Thou hast faced many things.\n"+
		"Tailor\n"+
		"I have.\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"Face not me: thou hast braved many men; brave not\n"+
		"me; I will neither be faced nor braved. I say unto\n"+
		"thee, I bid thy master cut out the gown; but I did\n"+
		"not bid him cut it to pieces: ergo, thou liest.\n"+
		"Tailor\n"+
		"Why, here is the note of the fashion to testify\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Read it.\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"The note lies in's throat, if he say I said so.\n"+
		"Tailor\n"+
		"[Reads] 'Imprimis, a loose-bodied gown:'\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"Master, if ever I said loose-bodied gown, sew me in\n"+
		"the skirts of it, and beat me to death with a bottom\n"+
		"of brown thread: I said a gown.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Proceed.\n"+
		"Tailor\n"+
		"[Reads] 'With a small compassed cape:'\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"I confess the cape.\n"+
		"Tailor\n"+
		"[Reads] 'With a trunk sleeve:'\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"I confess two sleeves.\n"+
		"Tailor\n"+
		"[Reads] 'The sleeves curiously cut.'\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Ay, there's the villany.\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"Error i' the bill, sir; error i' the bill.\n"+
		"I commanded the sleeves should be cut out and\n"+
		"sewed up again; and that I'll prove upon thee,\n"+
		"though thy little finger be armed in a thimble.\n"+
		"Tailor\n"+
		"This is true that I say: an I had thee\n"+
		"in place where, thou shouldst know it.\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"I am for thee straight: take thou the\n"+
		"bill, give me thy mete-yard, and spare not me.\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"God-a-mercy, Grumio! then he shall have no odds.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Well, sir, in brief, the gown is not for me.\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"You are i' the right, sir: 'tis for my mistress.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Go, take it up unto thy master's use.\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"Villain, not for thy life: take up my mistress'\n"+
		"gown for thy master's use!\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Why, sir, what's your conceit in that?\n"+
		"GRUMIO\n"+
		"O, sir, the conceit is deeper than you think for:\n"+
		"Take up my mistress' gown to his master's use!\n"+
		"O, fie, fie, fie!\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"[Aside] Hortensio, say thou wilt see the tailor paid.\n"+
		"Go take it hence; be gone, and say no more.\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"Tailor, I'll pay thee for thy gown tomorrow:\n"+
		"Take no unkindness of his hasty words:\n"+
		"Away! I say; commend me to thy master.\n"+
		"Exit Tailor\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Well, come, my Kate; we will unto your father's\n"+
		"Even in these honest mean habiliments:\n"+
		"Our purses shall be proud, our garments poor;\n"+
		"For 'tis the mind that makes the body rich;\n"+
		"And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds,\n"+
		"So honour peereth in the meanest habit.\n"+
		"What is the jay more precious than the lark,\n"+
		"Because his fathers are more beautiful?\n"+
		"Or is the adder better than the eel,\n"+
		"Because his painted skin contents the eye?\n"+
		"O, no, good Kate; neither art thou the worse\n"+
		"For this poor furniture and mean array.\n"+
		"if thou account'st it shame. lay it on me;\n"+
		"And therefore frolic: we will hence forthwith,\n"+
		"To feast and sport us at thy father's house.\n"+
		"Go, call my men, and let us straight to him;\n"+
		"And bring our horses unto Long-lane end;\n"+
		"There will we mount, and thither walk on foot\n"+
		"Let's see; I think 'tis now some seven o'clock,\n"+
		"And well we may come there by dinner-time.\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"I dare assure you, sir, 'tis almost two;\n"+
		"And 'twill be supper-time ere you come there.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"It shall be seven ere I go to horse:\n"+
		"Look, what I speak, or do, or think to do,\n"+
		"You are still crossing it. Sirs, let't alone:\n"+
		"I will not go to-day; and ere I do,\n"+

		"SCENE IV. Padua. Before BAPTISTA'S house.\n"+
		"Enter TRANIO, and the Pedant dressed like VINCENTIO\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"Sir, this is the house: please it you that I call?\n"+
		"Pedant\n"+
		"Ay, what else? and but I be deceived\n"+
		"Signior Baptista may remember me,\n"+
		"Near twenty years ago, in Genoa,\n"+
		"Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus.\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"'Tis well; and hold your own, in any case,\n"+
		"With such austerity as 'longeth to a father.\n"+
		"Pedant\n"+
		"I warrant you.\n"+
		"Enter BIONDELLO\n"+
		"But, sir, here comes your boy;\n"+
		"'Twere good he were school'd.\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"Fear you not him. Sirrah Biondello,\n"+
		"Now do your duty throughly, I advise you:\n"+
		"Imagine 'twere the right Vincentio.\n"+
		"BIONDELLO\n"+
		"Tut, fear not me.\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista?\n"+
		"BIONDELLO\n"+
		"I told him that your father was at Venice,\n"+
		"And that you look'd for him this day in Padua.\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"Thou'rt a tall fellow: hold thee that to drink.\n"+
		"Here comes Baptista: set your countenance, sir.\n"+
		"Enter BAPTISTA and LUCENTIO\n"+
		"Signior Baptista, you are happily met.\n"+
		"To the Pedant\n"+
		"Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of:\n"+
		"I pray you stand good father to me now,\n"+
		"Give me Bianca for my patrimony.\n"+
		"Pedant\n"+
		"Soft son!\n"+
		"Sir, by your leave: having come to Padua\n"+
		"To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio\n"+
		"Made me acquainted with a weighty cause\n"+
		"Of love between your daughter and himself:\n"+
		"And, for the good report I hear of you\n"+
		"And for the love he beareth to your daughter\n"+
		"And she to him, to stay him not too long,\n"+
		"I am content, in a good father's care,\n"+
		"To have him match'd; and if you please to like\n"+
		"No worse than I, upon some agreement\n"+
		"Me shall you find ready and willing\n"+
		"With one consent to have her so bestow'd;\n"+
		"For curious I cannot be with you,\n"+
		"Signior Baptista, of whom I hear so well.\n"+
		"BAPTISTA\n"+
		"Sir, pardon me in what I have to say:\n"+
		"Your plainness and your shortness please me well.\n"+
		"Right true it is, your son Lucentio here\n"+
		"Doth love my daughter and she loveth him,\n"+
		"Or both dissemble deeply their affections:\n"+
		"And therefore, if you say no more than this,\n"+
		"That like a father you will deal with him\n"+
		"And pass my daughter a sufficient dower,\n"+
		"The match is made, and all is done:\n"+
		"Your son shall have my daughter with consent.\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"I thank you, sir. Where then do you know best\n"+
		"We be affied and such assurance ta'en\n"+
		"As shall with either part's agreement stand?\n"+
		"BAPTISTA\n"+
		"Not in my house, Lucentio; for, you know,\n"+
		"Pitchers have ears, and I have many servants:\n"+
		"Besides, old Gremio is hearkening still;\n"+
		"And happily we might be interrupted.\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"Then at my lodging, an it like you:\n"+
		"There doth my father lie; and there, this night,\n"+
		"We'll pass the business privately and well.\n"+
		"Send for your daughter by your servant here:\n"+
		"My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently.\n"+
		"The worst is this, that, at so slender warning,\n"+
		"You are like to have a thin and slender pittance.\n"+
		"BAPTISTA\n"+
		"It likes me well. Biondello, hie you home,\n"+
		"And bid Bianca make her ready straight;\n"+
		"And, if you will, tell what hath happened,\n"+
		"Lucentio's father is arrived in Padua,\n"+
		"And how she's like to be Lucentio's wife.\n"+
		"BIONDELLO\n"+
		"I pray the gods she may with all my heart!\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone.\n"+
		"Exit BIONDELLO\n"+
		"Signior Baptista, shall I lead the way?\n"+
		"Welcome! one mess is like to be your cheer:\n"+
		"Come, sir; we will better it in Pisa.\n"+
		"BAPTISTA\n"+
		"I follow you.\n"+

		"BIONDELLO\n"+
		"Cambio!\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"What sayest thou, Biondello?\n"+
		"BIONDELLO\n"+
		"You saw my master wink and laugh upon you?\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"Biondello, what of that?\n"+
		"BIONDELLO\n"+
		"Faith, nothing; but has left me here behind, to\n"+
		"expound the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens.\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"I pray thee, moralize them.\n"+
		"BIONDELLO\n"+
		"Then thus. Baptista is safe, talking with the\n"+
		"deceiving father of a deceitful son.\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"And what of him?\n"+
		"BIONDELLO\n"+
		"His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper.\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"And then?\n"+
		"BIONDELLO\n"+
		"The old priest of Saint Luke's church is at your\n"+
		"command at all hours.\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"And what of all this?\n"+
		"BIONDELLO\n"+
		"I cannot tell; expect they are busied about a\n"+
		"counterfeit assurance: take you assurance of her,\n"+
		"'cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum:' to the\n"+
		"church; take the priest, clerk, and some sufficient\n"+
		"honest witnesses: If this be not that you look for,\n"+
		"I have no more to say, But bid Bianca farewell for\n"+
		"ever and a day.\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"Hearest thou, Biondello?\n"+
		"BIONDELLO\n"+
		"I cannot tarry: I knew a wench married in an\n"+
		"afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to\n"+
		"stuff a rabbit; and so may you, sir: and so, adieu,\n"+
		"sir. My master hath appointed me to go to Saint\n"+
		"Luke's, to bid the priest be ready to come against\n"+
		"you come with your appendix.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"I may, and will, if she be so contented:\n"+
		"She will be pleased; then wherefore should I doubt?\n"+
		"Hap what hap may, I'll roundly go about her:\n"+
		"It shall go hard if Cambio go without her.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE V. A public road.\n"+
		"Enter PETRUCHIO, KATHARINA, HORTENSIO, and Servants\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Come on, i' God's name; once more toward our father's.\n"+
		"Good Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon!\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"The moon! the sun: it is not moonlight now.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"I say it is the moon that shines so bright.\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"I know it is the sun that shines so bright.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Now, by my mother's son, and that's myself,\n"+
		"It shall be moon, or star, or what I list,\n"+
		"Or ere I journey to your father's house.\n"+
		"Go on, and fetch our horses back again.\n"+
		"Evermore cross'd and cross'd; nothing but cross'd!\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"Say as he says, or we shall never go.\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"Forward, I pray, since we have come so far,\n"+
		"And be it moon, or sun, or what you please:\n"+
		"An if you please to call it a rush-candle,\n"+
		"Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"I say it is the moon.\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"I know it is the moon.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Nay, then you lie: it is the blessed sun.\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"Then, God be bless'd, it is the blessed sun:\n"+
		"But sun it is not, when you say it is not;\n"+
		"And the moon changes even as your mind.\n"+
		"What you will have it named, even that it is;\n"+
		"And so it shall be so for Katharina.\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"Petruchio, go thy ways; the field is won.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Well, forward, forward! thus the bowl should run,\n"+
		"And not unluckily against the bias.\n"+
		"But, soft! company is coming here.\n"+
		"Enter VINCENTIO\n"+
		"To VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Good morrow, gentle mistress: where away?\n"+
		"Tell me, sweet Kate, and tell me truly too,\n"+
		"Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman?\n"+
		"Such war of white and red within her cheeks!\n"+
		"What stars do spangle heaven with such beauty,\n"+
		"As those two eyes become that heavenly face?\n"+
		"Fair lovely maid, once more good day to thee.\n"+
		"Sweet Kate, embrace her for her beauty's sake.\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"A' will make the man mad, to make a woman of him.\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"Young budding virgin, fair and fresh and sweet,\n"+
		"Whither away, or where is thy abode?\n"+
		"Happy the parents of so fair a child;\n"+
		"Happier the man, whom favourable stars\n"+
		"Allot thee for his lovely bed-fellow!\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Why, how now, Kate! I hope thou art not mad:\n"+
		"This is a man, old, wrinkled, faded, wither'd,\n"+
		"And not a maiden, as thou say'st he is.\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"Pardon, old father, my mistaking eyes,\n"+
		"That have been so bedazzled with the sun\n"+
		"That everything I look on seemeth green:\n"+
		"Now I perceive thou art a reverend father;\n"+
		"Pardon, I pray thee, for my mad mistaking.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Do, good old grandsire; and withal make known\n"+
		"Which way thou travellest: if along with us,\n"+
		"We shall be joyful of thy company.\n"+
		"VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Fair sir, and you my merry mistress,\n"+
		"That with your strange encounter much amazed me,\n"+
		"My name is call'd Vincentio; my dwelling Pisa;\n"+
		"And bound I am to Padua; there to visit\n"+
		"A son of mine, which long I have not seen.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"What is his name?\n"+
		"VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Lucentio, gentle sir.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Happily we met; the happier for thy son.\n"+
		"And now by law, as well as reverend age,\n"+
		"I may entitle thee my loving father:\n"+
		"The sister to my wife, this gentlewoman,\n"+
		"Thy son by this hath married. Wonder not,\n"+
		"Nor be grieved: she is of good esteem,\n"+
		"Her dowery wealthy, and of worthy birth;\n"+
		"Beside, so qualified as may beseem\n"+
		"The spouse of any noble gentleman.\n"+
		"Let me embrace with old Vincentio,\n"+
		"And wander we to see thy honest son,\n"+
		"Who will of thy arrival be full joyous.\n"+
		"VINCENTIO\n"+
		"But is it true? or else is it your pleasure,\n"+
		"Like pleasant travellers, to break a jest\n"+
		"Upon the company you overtake?\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"I do assure thee, father, so it is.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Come, go along, and see the truth hereof;\n"+
		"For our first merriment hath made thee jealous.\n"+
		"Exeunt all but HORTENSIO\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"Well, Petruchio, this has put me in heart.\n"+
		"Have to my widow! and if she be froward,\n"+
		"Then hast thou taught Hortensio to be untoward.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+

		"SCENE I. Padua. Before LUCENTIO'S house.\n"+
		"GREMIO discovered. Enter behind BIONDELLO, LUCENTIO, and BIANCA\n"+

		"Softly and swiftly, sir; for the priest is ready.\n"+

		"Nay, faith, I'll see the church o' your back; and\n"+

		"VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Is Signior Lucentio within, sir?\n"+
		"Pedant\n"+
		"He's within, sir, but not to be spoken withal.\n"+
		"VINCENTIO\n"+
		"What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two, to\n"+
		"make merry withal?\n"+
		"Pedant\n"+
		"Keep your hundred pounds to yourself: he shall\n"+
		"need none, so long as I live.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Nay, I told you your son was well beloved in Padua.\n"+
		"Do you hear, sir? To leave frivolous circumstances,\n"+
		"I pray you, tell Signior Lucentio that his father is\n"+
		"come from Pisa, and is here at the door to speak with him.\n"+
		"Pedant\n"+
		"Thou liest: his father is come from Padua and here\n"+

		"gods! O fine villain! A silken doublet! a velvet\n"+
		"hose! a scarlet cloak! and a copatain hat! O, I\n"+
		"am undone! I am undone! while I play the good\n"+
		"husband at home, my son and my servant spend all at\n"+
		"the university.\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"How now! what's the matter?\n"+
		"BAPTISTA\n"+
		"What, is the man lunatic?\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"Sir, you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your\n"+
		"habit, but your words show you a madman. Why, sir,\n"+
		"what 'cerns it you if I wear pearl and gold? I\n"+
		"thank my good father, I am able to maintain it.\n"+
		"VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Thy father! O villain! he is a sailmaker in Bergamo.\n"+
		"BAPTISTA\n"+
		"You mistake, sir, you mistake, sir. Pray, what do\n"+
		"you think is his name?\n"+
		"VINCENTIO\n"+
		"His name! as if I knew not his name: I have brought\n"+
		"him up ever since he was three years old, and his\n"+
		"name is Tranio.\n"+
		"Pedant\n"+
		"Away, away, mad ass! his name is Lucentio and he is\n"+

		"TRANIO\n"+
		"Call forth an officer.\n"+

		"Why, tell me, is not this my Cambio?\n"+
		"BIANCA\n"+
		"Cambio is changed into Lucentio.\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"Love wrought these miracles. Bianca's love\n"+

		"While he did bear my countenance in the town;\n"+
		"And happily I have arrived at the last\n"+
		"Unto the wished haven of my bliss.\n"+
		"What Tranio did, myself enforced him to;\n"+

		"Exeunt LUCENTIO and BIANCA\n"+
		"GREMIO\n"+
		"My cake is dough; but I'll in among the rest,\n"+
		"Out of hope of all, but my share of the feast.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"Husband, let's follow, to see the end of this ado.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"First kiss me, Kate, and we will.\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"What, in the midst of the street?\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"What, art thou ashamed of me?\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"No, sir, God forbid; but ashamed to kiss.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Why, then let's home again. Come, sirrah, let's away.\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"Nay, I will give thee a kiss: now pray thee, love, stay.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Is not this well? Come, my sweet Kate:\n"+
		"Better once than never, for never too late.\n"+

		"SCENE II. Padua. LUCENTIO'S house.\n"+
		"Enter BAPTISTA, VINCENTIO, GREMIO, the Pedant, LUCENTIO, BIANCA, PETRUCHIO, KATHARINA, HORTENSIO, and Widow, TRANIO, BIONDELLO, and GRUMIO the Serving-men with Tranio bringing in a banquet\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"At last, though long, our jarring notes agree:\n"+
		"And time it is, when raging war is done,\n"+
		"To smile at scapes and perils overblown.\n"+
		"My fair Bianca, bid my father welcome,\n"+
		"While I with self-same kindness welcome thine.\n"+
		"Brother Petruchio, sister Katharina,\n"+
		"And thou, Hortensio, with thy loving widow,\n"+
		"Feast with the best, and welcome to my house:\n"+
		"My banquet is to close our stomachs up,\n"+
		"After our great good cheer. Pray you, sit down;\n"+
		"For now we sit to chat as well as eat.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!\n"+
		"BAPTISTA\n"+
		"Padua affords this kindness, son Petruchio.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Padua affords nothing but what is kind.\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"For both our sakes, I would that word were true.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow.\n"+
		"Widow\n"+
		"Then never trust me, if I be afeard.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"You are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense:\n"+
		"I mean, Hortensio is afeard of you.\n"+
		"Widow\n"+
		"He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Roundly replied.\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"Mistress, how mean you that?\n"+
		"Widow\n"+
		"Thus I conceive by him.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Conceives by me! How likes Hortensio that?\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"My widow says, thus she conceives her tale.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Very well mended. Kiss him for that, good widow.\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"'He that is giddy thinks the world turns round:'\n"+
		"I pray you, tell me what you meant by that.\n"+
		"Widow\n"+
		"Your husband, being troubled with a shrew,\n"+
		"Measures my husband's sorrow by his woe:\n"+
		"And now you know my meaning,\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"A very mean meaning.\n"+
		"Widow\n"+
		"Right, I mean you.\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"And I am mean indeed, respecting you.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"To her, Kate!\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"To her, widow!\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"A hundred marks, my Kate does put her down.\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"That's my office.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Spoke like an officer; ha' to thee, lad!\n"+
		"Drinks to HORTENSIO\n"+
		"BAPTISTA\n"+
		"How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?\n"+
		"GREMIO\n"+
		"Believe me, sir, they butt together well.\n"+
		"BIANCA\n"+
		"Head, and butt! an hasty-witted body\n"+
		"Would say your head and butt were head and horn.\n"+
		"VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Ay, mistress bride, hath that awaken'd you?\n"+
		"BIANCA\n"+
		"Ay, but not frighted me; therefore I'll sleep again.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Nay, that you shall not: since you have begun,\n"+
		"Have at you for a bitter jest or two!\n"+
		"BIANCA\n"+
		"Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush;\n"+
		"And then pursue me as you draw your bow.\n"+
		"You are welcome all.\n"+
		"Exeunt BIANCA, KATHARINA, and Widow\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"She hath prevented me. Here, Signior Tranio.\n"+
		"This bird you aim'd at, though you hit her not;\n"+
		"Therefore a health to all that shot and miss'd.\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"O, sir, Lucentio slipp'd me like his greyhound,\n"+
		"Which runs himself and catches for his master.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"A good swift simile, but something currish.\n"+
		"TRANIO\n"+
		"'Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself:\n"+
		"'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.\n"+
		"BAPTISTA\n"+
		"O ho, Petruchio! Tranio hits you now.\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"I thank thee for that gird, good Tranio.\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"Confess, confess, hath he not hit you here?\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"A' has a little gall'd me, I confess;\n"+
		"And, as the jest did glance away from me,\n"+
		"'Tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright.\n"+
		"BAPTISTA\n"+
		"Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio,\n"+
		"I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Well, I say no: and therefore for assurance\n"+
		"Let's each one send unto his wife;\n"+
		"And he whose wife is most obedient\n"+
		"To come at first when he doth send for her,\n"+
		"Shall win the wager which we will propose.\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"Content. What is the wager?\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"Twenty crowns.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Twenty crowns!\n"+
		"I'll venture so much of my hawk or hound,\n"+
		"But twenty times so much upon my wife.\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"A hundred then.\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"Content.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"A match! 'tis done.\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"Who shall begin?\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"That will I.\n"+
		"Go, Biondello, bid your mistress come to me.\n"+
		"BIONDELLO\n"+
		"I go.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"BAPTISTA\n"+
		"Son, I'll be your half, Bianca comes.\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"I'll have no halves; I'll bear it all myself.\n"+
		"Re-enter BIONDELLO\n"+
		"How now! what news?\n"+
		"BIONDELLO\n"+
		"Sir, my mistress sends you word\n"+
		"That she is busy and she cannot come.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"How! she is busy and she cannot come!\n"+
		"Is that an answer?\n"+
		"GREMIO\n"+
		"Ay, and a kind one too:\n"+
		"Pray God, sir, your wife send you not a worse.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"I hope better.\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"Sirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife\n"+
		"To come to me forthwith.\n"+
		"Exit BIONDELLO\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"O, ho! entreat her!\n"+
		"Nay, then she must needs come.\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"I am afraid, sir,\n"+
		"Do what you can, yours will not be entreated.\n"+
		"Re-enter BIONDELLO\n"+
		"Now, where's my wife?\n"+
		"BIONDELLO\n"+
		"She says you have some goodly jest in hand:\n"+
		"She will not come: she bids you come to her.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Worse and worse; she will not come! O vile,\n"+
		"Intolerable, not to be endured!\n"+
		"Sirrah Grumio, go to your mistress;\n"+
		"Say, I command her to come to me.\n"+
		"Exit GRUMIO\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"I know her answer.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"What?\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"She will not.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"The fouler fortune mine, and there an end.\n"+
		"BAPTISTA\n"+
		"Now, by my holidame, here comes Katharina!\n"+
		"Re-enter KATARINA\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"What is your will, sir, that you send for me?\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Where is your sister, and Hortensio's wife?\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"They sit conferring by the parlor fire.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Go fetch them hither: if they deny to come.\n"+
		"Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands:\n"+
		"Away, I say, and bring them hither straight.\n"+
		"Exit KATHARINA\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder.\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"And so it is: I wonder what it bodes.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Marry, peace it bodes, and love and quiet life,\n"+
		"And awful rule and right supremacy;\n"+
		"And, to be short, what not, that's sweet and happy?\n"+
		"BAPTISTA\n"+
		"Now, fair befal thee, good Petruchio!\n"+
		"The wager thou hast won; and I will add\n"+
		"Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;\n"+
		"Another dowry to another daughter,\n"+
		"For she is changed, as she had never been.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Nay, I will win my wager better yet\n"+
		"And show more sign of her obedience,\n"+
		"Her new-built virtue and obedience.\n"+
		"See where she comes and brings your froward wives\n"+
		"As prisoners to her womanly persuasion.\n"+
		"Re-enter KATHARINA, with BIANCA and Widow\n"+
		"Katharina, that cap of yours becomes you not:\n"+
		"Off with that bauble, throw it under-foot.\n"+
		"Widow\n"+
		"Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh,\n"+
		"Till I be brought to such a silly pass!\n"+
		"BIANCA\n"+
		"Fie! what a foolish duty call you this?\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"I would your duty were as foolish too:\n"+
		"The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca,\n"+
		"Hath cost me an hundred crowns since supper-time.\n"+
		"BIANCA\n"+
		"The more fool you, for laying on my duty.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Katharina, I charge thee, tell these headstrong women\n"+
		"What duty they do owe their lords and husbands.\n"+
		"Widow\n"+
		"Come, come, you're mocking: we will have no telling.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Come on, I say; and first begin with her.\n"+
		"Widow\n"+
		"She shall not.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"I say she shall: and first begin with her.\n"+
		"KATHARINA\n"+
		"Fie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow,\n"+
		"And dart not scornful glances from those eyes,\n"+
		"To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor:\n"+
		"It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,\n"+
		"Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,\n"+
		"And in no sense is meet or amiable.\n"+
		"A woman moved is like a fountain troubled,\n"+
		"Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty;\n"+
		"And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty\n"+
		"Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.\n"+
		"Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,\n"+
		"Thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,\n"+
		"And for thy maintenance commits his body\n"+
		"To painful labour both by sea and land,\n"+
		"To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,\n"+
		"Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe;\n"+
		"And craves no other tribute at thy hands\n"+
		"But love, fair looks and true obedience;\n"+
		"Too little payment for so great a debt.\n"+
		"Such duty as the subject owes the prince\n"+
		"Even such a woman oweth to her husband;\n"+
		"And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,\n"+
		"And not obedient to his honest will,\n"+
		"What is she but a foul contending rebel\n"+
		"And graceless traitor to her loving lord?\n"+
		"I am ashamed that women are so simple\n"+
		"To offer war where they should kneel for peace;\n"+
		"Or seek for rule, supremacy and sway,\n"+
		"When they are bound to serve, love and obey.\n"+
		"Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,\n"+
		"Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,\n"+
		"But that our soft conditions and our hearts\n"+
		"Should well agree with our external parts?\n"+
		"Come, come, you froward and unable worms!\n"+
		"My mind hath been as big as one of yours,\n"+
		"My heart as great, my reason haply more,\n"+
		"To bandy word for word and frown for frown;\n"+
		"But now I see our lances are but straws,\n"+
		"Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,\n"+
		"That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.\n"+
		"Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,\n"+
		"And place your hands below your husband's foot:\n"+
		"In token of which duty, if he please,\n"+
		"My hand is ready; may it do him ease.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Why, there's a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate.\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"Well, go thy ways, old lad; for thou shalt ha't.\n"+
		"VINCENTIO\n"+
		"'Tis a good hearing when children are toward.\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"But a harsh hearing when women are froward.\n"+
		"PETRUCHIO\n"+
		"Come, Kate, we'll to bed.\n"+
		"We three are married, but you two are sped.\n"+
		"To LUCENTIO\n"+
		"'Twas I won the wager, though you hit the white;\n"+
		"And, being a winner, God give you good night!\n"+
		"Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHARINA\n"+
		"HORTENSIO\n"+
		"Now, go thy ways; thou hast tamed a curst shrew.\n"+
		"LUCENTIO\n"+
		"'Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tamed so.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"
