		"ACT I\n"+
		"SCENE I. Britain. The garden of Cymbeline's palace.\n"+
		"Enter two Gentlemen\n"+
		"First Gentleman\n"+
		"You do not meet a man but frowns: our bloods\n"+
		"No more obey the heavens than our courtiers\n"+
		"Still seem as does the king.\n"+
		"Second Gentleman\n"+
		"But what's the matter?\n"+
		"First Gentleman\n"+
		"His daughter, and the heir of's kingdom, whom\n"+
		"He purposed to his wife's sole son--a widow\n"+
		"That late he married--hath referr'd herself\n"+
		"Unto a poor but worthy gentleman: she's wedded;\n"+
		"Her husband banish'd; she imprison'd: all\n"+
		"Is outward sorrow; though I think the king\n"+
		"Be touch'd at very heart.\n"+
		"Second Gentleman\n"+
		"None but the king?\n"+
		"First Gentleman\n"+
		"He that hath lost her too; so is the queen,\n"+
		"That most desired the match; but not a courtier,\n"+
		"Although they wear their faces to the bent\n"+
		"Of the king's look's, hath a heart that is not\n"+
		"Glad at the thing they scowl at.\n"+
		"Second Gentleman\n"+
		"And why so?\n"+
		"First Gentleman\n"+
		"He that hath miss'd the princess is a thing\n"+
		"Too bad for bad report: and he that hath her--\n"+
		"I mean, that married her, alack, good man!\n"+
		"And therefore banish'd--is a creature such\n"+
		"As, to seek through the regions of the earth\n"+
		"For one his like, there would be something failing\n"+
		"In him that should compare. I do not think\n"+
		"So fair an outward and such stuff within\n"+
		"Endows a man but he.\n"+
		"Second Gentleman\n"+
		"You speak him far.\n"+
		"First Gentleman\n"+
		"I do extend him, sir, within himself,\n"+
		"Crush him together rather than unfold\n"+
		"His measure duly.\n"+
		"Second Gentleman\n"+
		"What's his name and birth?\n"+
		"First Gentleman\n"+
		"I cannot delve him to the root: his father\n"+
		"Was call'd Sicilius, who did join his honour\n"+
		"Against the Romans with Cassibelan,\n"+
		"But had his titles by Tenantius whom\n"+
		"He served with glory and admired success,\n"+
		"So gain'd the sur-addition Leonatus;\n"+
		"And had, besides this gentleman in question,\n"+
		"Two other sons, who in the wars o' the time\n"+
		"Died with their swords in hand; for which\n"+
		"their father,\n"+
		"Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow\n"+
		"That he quit being, and his gentle lady,\n"+
		"Big of this gentleman our theme, deceased\n"+
		"As he was born. The king he takes the babe\n"+
		"To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,\n"+
		"Breeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber,\n"+
		"Puts to him all the learnings that his time\n"+
		"Could make him the receiver of; which he took,\n"+
		"As we do air, fast as 'twas minister'd,\n"+
		"And in's spring became a harvest, lived in court--\n"+
		"Which rare it is to do--most praised, most loved,\n"+
		"A sample to the youngest, to the more mature\n"+
		"A glass that feated them, and to the graver\n"+
		"A child that guided dotards; to his mistress,\n"+
		"For whom he now is banish'd, her own price\n"+
		"Proclaims how she esteem'd him and his virtue;\n"+
		"By her election may be truly read\n"+
		"What kind of man he is.\n"+
		"Second Gentleman\n"+
		"I honour him\n"+
		"Even out of your report. But, pray you, tell me,\n"+
		"Is she sole child to the king?\n"+
		"First Gentleman\n"+
		"His only child.\n"+
		"He had two sons: if this be worth your hearing,\n"+
		"Mark it: the eldest of them at three years old,\n"+
		"I' the swathing-clothes the other, from their nursery\n"+
		"Were stol'n, and to this hour no guess in knowledge\n"+
		"Which way they went.\n"+
		"Second Gentleman\n"+
		"How long is this ago?\n"+
		"First Gentleman\n"+
		"Some twenty years.\n"+
		"Second Gentleman\n"+
		"That a king's children should be so convey'd,\n"+
		"So slackly guarded, and the search so slow,\n"+
		"That could not trace them!\n"+
		"First Gentleman\n"+
		"Howsoe'er 'tis strange,\n"+
		"Or that the negligence may well be laugh'd at,\n"+
		"Yet is it true, sir.\n"+
		"Second Gentleman\n"+
		"I do well believe you.\n"+
		"First Gentleman\n"+
		"We must forbear: here comes the gentleman,\n"+
		"The queen, and princess.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"Enter the QUEEN, POSTHUMUS LEONATUS, and IMOGEN\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"No, be assured you shall not find me, daughter,\n"+
		"After the slander of most stepmothers,\n"+
		"Evil-eyed unto you: you're my prisoner, but\n"+
		"Your gaoler shall deliver you the keys\n"+
		"That lock up your restraint. For you, Posthumus,\n"+
		"So soon as I can win the offended king,\n"+
		"I will be known your advocate: marry, yet\n"+
		"The fire of rage is in him, and 'twere good\n"+
		"You lean'd unto his sentence with what patience\n"+
		"Your wisdom may inform you.\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"Please your highness,\n"+
		"I will from hence to-day.\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"You know the peril.\n"+
		"I'll fetch a turn about the garden, pitying\n"+
		"The pangs of barr'd affections, though the king\n"+
		"Hath charged you should not speak together.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"O\n"+
		"Dissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrant\n"+
		"Can tickle where she wounds! My dearest husband,\n"+
		"I something fear my father's wrath; but nothing--\n"+
		"Always reserved my holy duty--what\n"+
		"His rage can do on me: you must be gone;\n"+
		"And I shall here abide the hourly shot\n"+
		"Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,\n"+
		"But that there is this jewel in the world\n"+
		"That I may see again.\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"My queen! my mistress!\n"+
		"O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause\n"+
		"To be suspected of more tenderness\n"+
		"Than doth become a man. I will remain\n"+
		"The loyal'st husband that did e'er plight troth:\n"+
		"My residence in Rome at one Philario's,\n"+
		"Who to my father was a friend, to me\n"+
		"Known but by letter: thither write, my queen,\n"+
		"And with mine eyes I'll drink the words you send,\n"+
		"Though ink be made of gall.\n"+
		"Re-enter QUEEN\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"Be brief, I pray you:\n"+
		"If the king come, I shall incur I know not\n"+
		"How much of his displeasure.\n"+
		"Aside\n"+
		"Yet I'll move him\n"+
		"To walk this way: I never do him wrong,\n"+
		"But he does buy my injuries, to be friends;\n"+
		"Pays dear for my offences.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"Should we be taking leave\n"+
		"As long a term as yet we have to live,\n"+
		"The loathness to depart would grow. Adieu!\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"Nay, stay a little:\n"+
		"Were you but riding forth to air yourself,\n"+
		"Such parting were too petty. Look here, love;\n"+
		"This diamond was my mother's: take it, heart;\n"+
		"But keep it till you woo another wife,\n"+
		"When Imogen is dead.\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"How, how! another?\n"+
		"You gentle gods, give me but this I have,\n"+
		"And sear up my embracements from a next\n"+
		"With bonds of death!\n"+
		"Putting on the ring\n"+
		"Remain, remain thou here\n"+
		"While sense can keep it on. And, sweetest, fairest,\n"+
		"As I my poor self did exchange for you,\n"+
		"To your so infinite loss, so in our trifles\n"+
		"I still win of you: for my sake wear this;\n"+
		"It is a manacle of love; I'll place it\n"+
		"Upon this fairest prisoner.\n"+
		"Putting a bracelet upon her arm\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"O the gods!\n"+
		"When shall we see again?\n"+
		"Enter CYMBELINE and Lords\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"Alack, the king!\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"Thou basest thing, avoid! hence, from my sight!\n"+
		"If after this command thou fraught the court\n"+
		"With thy unworthiness, thou diest: away!\n"+
		"Thou'rt poison to my blood.\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"The gods protect you!\n"+
		"And bless the good remainders of the court! I am gone.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"There cannot be a pinch in death\n"+
		"More sharp than this is.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"O disloyal thing,\n"+
		"That shouldst repair my youth, thou heap'st\n"+
		"A year's age on me.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"I beseech you, sir,\n"+
		"Harm not yourself with your vexation\n"+
		"I am senseless of your wrath; a touch more rare\n"+
		"Subdues all pangs, all fears.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"Past grace? obedience?\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"Past hope, and in despair; that way, past grace.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"That mightst have had the sole son of my queen!\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"O blest, that I might not! I chose an eagle,\n"+
		"And did avoid a puttock.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"Thou took'st a beggar; wouldst have made my throne\n"+
		"A seat for baseness.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"No; I rather added\n"+
		"A lustre to it.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"O thou vile one!\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"Sir,\n"+
		"It is your fault that I have loved Posthumus:\n"+
		"You bred him as my playfellow, and he is\n"+
		"A man worth any woman, overbuys me\n"+
		"Almost the sum he pays.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"What, art thou mad?\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"Almost, sir: heaven restore me! Would I were\n"+
		"A neat-herd's daughter, and my Leonatus\n"+
		"Our neighbour shepherd's son!\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"Thou foolish thing!\n"+
		"Re-enter QUEEN\n"+
		"They were again together: you have done\n"+
		"Not after our command. Away with her,\n"+
		"And pen her up.\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"Beseech your patience. Peace,\n"+
		"Dear lady daughter, peace! Sweet sovereign,\n"+
		"Leave us to ourselves; and make yourself some comfort\n"+
		"Out of your best advice.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"Nay, let her languish\n"+
		"A drop of blood a day; and, being aged,\n"+
		"Die of this folly!\n"+
		"Exeunt CYMBELINE and Lords\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"Fie! you must give way.\n"+
		"Enter PISANIO\n"+
		"Here is your servant. How now, sir! What news?\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"My lord your son drew on my master.\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"Ha!\n"+
		"No harm, I trust, is done?\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"There might have been,\n"+
		"But that my master rather play'd than fought\n"+
		"And had no help of anger: they were parted\n"+
		"By gentlemen at hand.\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"I am very glad on't.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"Your son's my father's friend; he takes his part.\n"+
		"To draw upon an exile! O brave sir!\n"+
		"I would they were in Afric both together;\n"+
		"Myself by with a needle, that I might prick\n"+
		"The goer-back. Why came you from your master?\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"On his command: he would not suffer me\n"+
		"To bring him to the haven; left these notes\n"+
		"Of what commands I should be subject to,\n"+
		"When 't pleased you to employ me.\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"This hath been\n"+
		"Your faithful servant: I dare lay mine honour\n"+
		"He will remain so.\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"I humbly thank your highness.\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"Pray, walk awhile.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"About some half-hour hence,\n"+
		"I pray you, speak with me: you shall at least\n"+
		"Go see my lord aboard: for this time leave me.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. The same. A public place.\n"+
		"Enter CLOTEN and two Lords\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"Sir, I would advise you to shift a shirt; the\n"+
		"violence of action hath made you reek as a\n"+
		"sacrifice: where air comes out, air comes in:\n"+
		"there's none abroad so wholesome as that you vent.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"If my shirt were bloody, then to shift it. Have I hurt him?\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"[Aside] No, 'faith; not so much as his patience.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"Hurt him! his body's a passable carcass, if he be\n"+
		"not hurt: it is a thoroughfare for steel, if it be not hurt.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"[Aside] His steel was in debt; it went o' the\n"+
		"backside the town.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"The villain would not stand me.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"[Aside] No; but he fled forward still, toward your face.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"Stand you! You have land enough of your own: but\n"+
		"he added to your having; gave you some ground.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"[Aside] As many inches as you have oceans. Puppies!\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"I would they had not come between us.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"[Aside] So would I, till you had measured how long\n"+
		"a fool you were upon the ground.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"And that she should love this fellow and refuse me!\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"[Aside] If it be a sin to make a true election, she\n"+
		"is damned.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"Sir, as I told you always, her beauty and her brain\n"+
		"go not together: she's a good sign, but I have seen\n"+
		"small reflection of her wit.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"[Aside] She shines not upon fools, lest the\n"+
		"reflection should hurt her.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"Come, I'll to my chamber. Would there had been some\n"+
		"hurt done!\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"[Aside] I wish not so; unless it had been the fall\n"+
		"of an ass, which is no great hurt.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"You'll go with us?\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"I'll attend your lordship.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"Nay, come, let's go together.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"Well, my lord.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. A room in Cymbeline's palace.\n"+
		"Enter IMOGEN and PISANIO\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"I would thou grew'st unto the shores o' the haven,\n"+
		"And question'dst every sail: if he should write\n"+
		"And not have it, 'twere a paper lost,\n"+
		"As offer'd mercy is. What was the last\n"+
		"That he spake to thee?\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"It was his queen, his queen!\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"Then waved his handkerchief?\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"And kiss'd it, madam.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"Senseless Linen! happier therein than I!\n"+
		"And that was all?\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"No, madam; for so long\n"+
		"As he could make me with this eye or ear\n"+
		"Distinguish him from others, he did keep\n"+
		"The deck, with glove, or hat, or handkerchief,\n"+
		"Still waving, as the fits and stirs of 's mind\n"+
		"Could best express how slow his soul sail'd on,\n"+
		"How swift his ship.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"Thou shouldst have made him\n"+
		"As little as a crow, or less, ere left\n"+
		"To after-eye him.\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"Madam, so I did.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"I would have broke mine eye-strings; crack'd them, but\n"+
		"To look upon him, till the diminution\n"+
		"Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle,\n"+
		"Nay, follow'd him, till he had melted from\n"+
		"The smallness of a gnat to air, and then\n"+
		"Have turn'd mine eye and wept. But, good Pisanio,\n"+
		"When shall we hear from him?\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"Be assured, madam,\n"+
		"With his next vantage.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"I did not take my leave of him, but had\n"+
		"Most pretty things to say: ere I could tell him\n"+
		"How I would think on him at certain hours\n"+
		"Such thoughts and such, or I could make him swear\n"+
		"The shes of Italy should not betray\n"+
		"Mine interest and his honour, or have charged him,\n"+
		"At the sixth hour of morn, at noon, at midnight,\n"+
		"To encounter me with orisons, for then\n"+
		"I am in heaven for him; or ere I could\n"+
		"Give him that parting kiss which I had set\n"+
		"Betwixt two charming words, comes in my father\n"+
		"And like the tyrannous breathing of the north\n"+
		"Shakes all our buds from growing.\n"+
		"Enter a Lady\n"+
		"Lady\n"+
		"The queen, madam,\n"+
		"Desires your highness' company.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"Those things I bid you do, get them dispatch'd.\n"+
		"I will attend the queen.\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"Madam, I shall.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV. Rome. Philario's house.\n"+
		"Enter PHILARIO, IACHIMO, a Frenchman, a Dutchman, and a Spaniard\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"Believe it, sir, I have seen him in Britain: he was\n"+
		"then of a crescent note, expected to prove so worthy\n"+
		"as since he hath been allowed the name of; but I\n"+
		"could then have looked on him without the help of\n"+
		"admiration, though the catalogue of his endowments\n"+
		"had been tabled by his side and I to peruse him by items.\n"+
		"PHILARIO\n"+
		"You speak of him when he was less furnished than now\n"+
		"he is with that which makes him both without and within.\n"+
		"Frenchman\n"+
		"I have seen him in France: we had very many there\n"+
		"could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"This matter of marrying his king's daughter, wherein\n"+
		"he must be weighed rather by her value than his own,\n"+
		"words him, I doubt not, a great deal from the matter.\n"+
		"Frenchman\n"+
		"And then his banishment.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"Ay, and the approbation of those that weep this\n"+
		"lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully\n"+
		"to extend him; be it but to fortify her judgment,\n"+
		"which else an easy battery might lay flat, for\n"+
		"taking a beggar without less quality. But how comes\n"+
		"it he is to sojourn with you? How creeps\n"+
		"acquaintance?\n"+
		"PHILARIO\n"+
		"His father and I were soldiers together; to whom I\n"+
		"have been often bound for no less than my life.\n"+
		"Here comes the Briton: let him be so entertained\n"+
		"amongst you as suits, with gentlemen of your\n"+
		"knowing, to a stranger of his quality.\n"+
		"Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"I beseech you all, be better known to this\n"+
		"gentleman; whom I commend to you as a noble friend\n"+
		"of mine: how worthy he is I will leave to appear\n"+
		"hereafter, rather than story him in his own hearing.\n"+
		"Frenchman\n"+
		"Sir, we have known together in Orleans.\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"Since when I have been debtor to you for courtesies,\n"+
		"which I will be ever to pay and yet pay still.\n"+
		"Frenchman\n"+
		"Sir, you o'er-rate my poor kindness: I was glad I\n"+
		"did atone my countryman and you; it had been pity\n"+
		"you should have been put together with so mortal a\n"+
		"purpose as then each bore, upon importance of so\n"+
		"slight and trivial a nature.\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"By your pardon, sir, I was then a young traveller;\n"+
		"rather shunned to go even with what I heard than in\n"+
		"my every action to be guided by others' experiences:\n"+
		"but upon my mended judgment--if I offend not to say\n"+
		"it is mended--my quarrel was not altogether slight.\n"+
		"Frenchman\n"+
		"'Faith, yes, to be put to the arbitrement of swords,\n"+
		"and by such two that would by all likelihood have\n"+
		"confounded one the other, or have fallen both.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"Can we, with manners, ask what was the difference?\n"+
		"Frenchman\n"+
		"Safely, I think: 'twas a contention in public,\n"+
		"which may, without contradiction, suffer the report.\n"+
		"It was much like an argument that fell out last\n"+
		"night, where each of us fell in praise of our\n"+
		"country mistresses; this gentleman at that time\n"+
		"vouching--and upon warrant of bloody\n"+
		"affirmation--his to be more fair, virtuous, wise,\n"+
		"chaste, constant-qualified and less attemptable\n"+
		"than any the rarest of our ladies in France.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"That lady is not now living, or this gentleman's\n"+
		"opinion by this worn out.\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"She holds her virtue still and I my mind.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"You must not so far prefer her 'fore ours of Italy.\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"Being so far provoked as I was in France, I would\n"+
		"abate her nothing, though I profess myself her\n"+
		"adorer, not her friend.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"As fair and as good--a kind of hand-in-hand\n"+
		"comparison--had been something too fair and too good\n"+
		"for any lady in Britain. If she went before others\n"+
		"I have seen, as that diamond of yours outlustres\n"+
		"many I have beheld. I could not but believe she\n"+
		"excelled many: but I have not seen the most\n"+
		"precious diamond that is, nor you the lady.\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"I praised her as I rated her: so do I my stone.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"What do you esteem it at?\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"More than the world enjoys.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"Either your unparagoned mistress is dead, or she's\n"+
		"outprized by a trifle.\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"You are mistaken: the one may be sold, or given, if\n"+
		"there were wealth enough for the purchase, or merit\n"+
		"for the gift: the other is not a thing for sale,\n"+
		"and only the gift of the gods.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"Which the gods have given you?\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"Which, by their graces, I will keep.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"You may wear her in title yours: but, you know,\n"+
		"strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds. Your\n"+
		"ring may be stolen too: so your brace of unprizable\n"+
		"estimations; the one is but frail and the other\n"+
		"casual; a cunning thief, or a that way accomplished\n"+
		"courtier, would hazard the winning both of first and last.\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"Your Italy contains none so accomplished a courtier\n"+
		"to convince the honour of my mistress, if, in the\n"+
		"holding or loss of that, you term her frail. I do\n"+
		"nothing doubt you have store of thieves;\n"+
		"notwithstanding, I fear not my ring.\n"+
		"PHILARIO\n"+
		"Let us leave here, gentlemen.\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"Sir, with all my heart. This worthy signior, I\n"+
		"thank him, makes no stranger of me; we are familiar at first.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"With five times so much conversation, I should get\n"+
		"ground of your fair mistress, make her go back, even\n"+
		"to the yielding, had I admittance and opportunity to friend.\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"No, no.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to\n"+
		"your ring; which, in my opinion, o'ervalues it\n"+
		"something: but I make my wager rather against your\n"+
		"confidence than her reputation: and, to bar your\n"+
		"offence herein too, I durst attempt it against any\n"+
		"lady in the world.\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"You are a great deal abused in too bold a\n"+
		"persuasion; and I doubt not you sustain what you're\n"+
		"worthy of by your attempt.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"What's that?\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"A repulse: though your attempt, as you call it,\n"+
		"deserve more; a punishment too.\n"+
		"PHILARIO\n"+
		"Gentlemen, enough of this: it came in too suddenly;\n"+
		"let it die as it was born, and, I pray you, be\n"+
		"better acquainted.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"Would I had put my estate and my neighbour's on the\n"+
		"approbation of what I have spoke!\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"What lady would you choose to assail?\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"Yours; whom in constancy you think stands so safe.\n"+
		"I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring,\n"+
		"that, commend me to the court where your lady is,\n"+
		"with no more advantage than the opportunity of a\n"+
		"second conference, and I will bring from thence\n"+
		"that honour of hers which you imagine so reserved.\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"I will wage against your gold, gold to it: my ring\n"+
		"I hold dear as my finger; 'tis part of it.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"You are afraid, and therein the wiser. If you buy\n"+
		"ladies' flesh at a million a dram, you cannot\n"+
		"preserve it from tainting: but I see you have some\n"+
		"religion in you, that you fear.\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"This is but a custom in your tongue; you bear a\n"+
		"graver purpose, I hope.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"I am the master of my speeches, and would undergo\n"+
		"what's spoken, I swear.\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"Will you? I shall but lend my diamond till your\n"+
		"return: let there be covenants drawn between's: my\n"+
		"mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your\n"+
		"unworthy thinking: I dare you to this match: here's my ring.\n"+
		"PHILARIO\n"+
		"I will have it no lay.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"By the gods, it is one. If I bring you no\n"+
		"sufficient testimony that I have enjoyed the dearest\n"+
		"bodily part of your mistress, my ten thousand ducats\n"+
		"are yours; so is your diamond too: if I come off,\n"+
		"and leave her in such honour as you have trust in,\n"+
		"she your jewel, this your jewel, and my gold are\n"+
		"yours: provided I have your commendation for my more\n"+
		"free entertainment.\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"I embrace these conditions; let us have articles\n"+
		"betwixt us. Only, thus far you shall answer: if\n"+
		"you make your voyage upon her and give me directly\n"+
		"to understand you have prevailed, I am no further\n"+
		"your enemy; she is not worth our debate: if she\n"+
		"remain unseduced, you not making it appear\n"+
		"otherwise, for your ill opinion and the assault you\n"+
		"have made to her chastity you shall answer me with\n"+
		"your sword.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"Your hand; a covenant: we will have these things set\n"+
		"down by lawful counsel, and straight away for\n"+
		"Britain, lest the bargain should catch cold and\n"+
		"starve: I will fetch my gold and have our two\n"+
		"wagers recorded.\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"Agreed.\n"+
		"Exeunt POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and IACHIMO\n"+
		"Frenchman\n"+
		"Will this hold, think you?\n"+
		"PHILARIO\n"+
		"Signior Iachimo will not from it.\n"+
		"Pray, let us follow 'em.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE V. Britain. A room in Cymbeline's palace.\n"+
		"Enter QUEEN, Ladies, and CORNELIUS\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"Whiles yet the dew's on ground, gather those flowers;\n"+
		"Make haste: who has the note of them?\n"+
		"First Lady\n"+
		"I, madam.\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"Dispatch.\n"+
		"Exeunt Ladies\n"+
		"Now, master doctor, have you brought those drugs?\n"+
		"CORNELIUS\n"+
		"Pleaseth your highness, ay: here they are, madam:\n"+
		"Presenting a small box\n"+
		"But I beseech your grace, without offence,--\n"+
		"My conscience bids me ask--wherefore you have\n"+
		"Commanded of me those most poisonous compounds,\n"+
		"Which are the movers of a languishing death;\n"+
		"But though slow, deadly?\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"I wonder, doctor,\n"+
		"Thou ask'st me such a question. Have I not been\n"+
		"Thy pupil long? Hast thou not learn'd me how\n"+
		"To make perfumes? distil? preserve? yea, so\n"+
		"That our great king himself doth woo me oft\n"+
		"For my confections? Having thus far proceeded,--\n"+
		"Unless thou think'st me devilish--is't not meet\n"+
		"That I did amplify my judgment in\n"+
		"Other conclusions? I will try the forces\n"+
		"Of these thy compounds on such creatures as\n"+
		"We count not worth the hanging, but none human,\n"+
		"To try the vigour of them and apply\n"+
		"Allayments to their act, and by them gather\n"+
		"Their several virtues and effects.\n"+
		"CORNELIUS\n"+
		"Your highness\n"+
		"Shall from this practise but make hard your heart:\n"+
		"Besides, the seeing these effects will be\n"+
		"Both noisome and infectious.\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"O, content thee.\n"+
		"Enter PISANIO\n"+
		"Aside\n"+
		"Here comes a flattering rascal; upon him\n"+
		"Will I first work: he's for his master,\n"+
		"An enemy to my son. How now, Pisanio!\n"+
		"Doctor, your service for this time is ended;\n"+
		"Take your own way.\n"+
		"CORNELIUS\n"+
		"[Aside] I do suspect you, madam;\n"+
		"But you shall do no harm.\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"[To PISANIO] Hark thee, a word.\n"+
		"CORNELIUS\n"+
		"[Aside] I do not like her. She doth think she has\n"+
		"Strange lingering poisons: I do know her spirit,\n"+
		"And will not trust one of her malice with\n"+
		"A drug of such damn'd nature. Those she has\n"+
		"Will stupefy and dull the sense awhile;\n"+
		"Which first, perchance, she'll prove on\n"+
		"cats and dogs,\n"+
		"Then afterward up higher: but there is\n"+
		"No danger in what show of death it makes,\n"+
		"More than the locking-up the spirits a time,\n"+
		"To be more fresh, reviving. She is fool'd\n"+
		"With a most false effect; and I the truer,\n"+
		"So to be false with her.\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"No further service, doctor,\n"+
		"Until I send for thee.\n"+
		"CORNELIUS\n"+
		"I humbly take my leave.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"Weeps she still, say'st thou? Dost thou think in time\n"+
		"She will not quench and let instructions enter\n"+
		"Where folly now possesses? Do thou work:\n"+
		"When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son,\n"+
		"I'll tell thee on the instant thou art then\n"+
		"As great as is thy master, greater, for\n"+
		"His fortunes all lie speechless and his name\n"+
		"Is at last gasp: return he cannot, nor\n"+
		"Continue where he is: to shift his being\n"+
		"Is to exchange one misery with another,\n"+
		"And every day that comes comes to decay\n"+
		"A day's work in him. What shalt thou expect,\n"+
		"To be depender on a thing that leans,\n"+
		"Who cannot be new built, nor has no friends,\n"+
		"So much as but to prop him?\n"+
		"The QUEEN drops the box: PISANIO takes it up\n"+
		"Thou takest up\n"+
		"Thou know'st not what; but take it for thy labour:\n"+
		"It is a thing I made, which hath the king\n"+
		"Five times redeem'd from death: I do not know\n"+
		"What is more cordial. Nay, I prethee, take it;\n"+
		"It is an earnest of a further good\n"+
		"That I mean to thee. Tell thy mistress how\n"+
		"The case stands with her; do't as from thyself.\n"+
		"Think what a chance thou changest on, but think\n"+
		"Thou hast thy mistress still, to boot, my son,\n"+
		"Who shall take notice of thee: I'll move the king\n"+
		"To any shape of thy preferment such\n"+
		"As thou'lt desire; and then myself, I chiefly,\n"+
		"That set thee on to this desert, am bound\n"+
		"To load thy merit richly. Call my women:\n"+
		"Think on my words.\n"+
		"Exit PISANIO\n"+
		"A sly and constant knave,\n"+
		"Not to be shaked; the agent for his master\n"+
		"And the remembrancer of her to hold\n"+
		"The hand-fast to her lord. I have given him that\n"+
		"Which, if he take, shall quite unpeople her\n"+
		"Of liegers for her sweet, and which she after,\n"+
		"Except she bend her humour, shall be assured\n"+
		"To taste of too.\n"+
		"Re-enter PISANIO and Ladies\n"+
		"So, so: well done, well done:\n"+
		"The violets, cowslips, and the primroses,\n"+
		"Bear to my closet. Fare thee well, Pisanio;\n"+
		"Think on my words.\n"+
		"Exeunt QUEEN and Ladies\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"And shall do:\n"+
		"But when to my good lord I prove untrue,\n"+
		"I'll choke myself: there's all I'll do for you.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE VI. The same. Another room in the palace.\n"+
		"Enter IMOGEN\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"A father cruel, and a step-dame false;\n"+
		"A foolish suitor to a wedded lady,\n"+
		"That hath her husband banish'd;--O, that husband!\n"+
		"My supreme crown of grief! and those repeated\n"+
		"Vexations of it! Had I been thief-stol'n,\n"+
		"As my two brothers, happy! but most miserable\n"+
		"Is the desire that's glorious: blest be those,\n"+
		"How mean soe'er, that have their honest wills,\n"+
		"Which seasons comfort. Who may this be? Fie!\n"+
		"Enter PISANIO and IACHIMO\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"Madam, a noble gentleman of Rome,\n"+
		"Comes from my lord with letters.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"Change you, madam?\n"+
		"The worthy Leonatus is in safety\n"+
		"And greets your highness dearly.\n"+
		"Presents a letter\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"Thanks, good sir:\n"+
		"You're kindly welcome.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"[Aside] All of her that is out of door most rich!\n"+
		"If she be furnish'd with a mind so rare,\n"+
		"She is alone the Arabian bird, and I\n"+
		"Have lost the wager. Boldness be my friend!\n"+
		"Arm me, audacity, from head to foot!\n"+
		"Or, like the Parthian, I shall flying fight;\n"+
		"Rather directly fly.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"[Reads] 'He is one of the noblest note, to whose\n"+
		"kindnesses I am most infinitely tied. Reflect upon\n"+
		"him accordingly, as you value your trust--\n"+
		"LEONATUS.'\n"+
		"So far I read aloud:\n"+
		"But even the very middle of my heart\n"+
		"Is warm'd by the rest, and takes it thankfully.\n"+
		"You are as welcome, worthy sir, as I\n"+
		"Have words to bid you, and shall find it so\n"+
		"In all that I can do.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"Thanks, fairest lady.\n"+
		"What, are men mad? Hath nature given them eyes\n"+
		"To see this vaulted arch, and the rich crop\n"+
		"Of sea and land, which can distinguish 'twixt\n"+
		"The fiery orbs above and the twinn'd stones\n"+
		"Upon the number'd beach? and can we not\n"+
		"Partition make with spectacles so precious\n"+
		"'Twixt fair and foul?\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"What makes your admiration?\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"It cannot be i' the eye, for apes and monkeys\n"+
		"'Twixt two such shes would chatter this way and\n"+
		"Contemn with mows the other; nor i' the judgment,\n"+
		"For idiots in this case of favour would\n"+
		"Be wisely definite; nor i' the appetite;\n"+
		"Sluttery to such neat excellence opposed\n"+
		"Should make desire vomit emptiness,\n"+
		"Not so allured to feed.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"What is the matter, trow?\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"The cloyed will,\n"+
		"That satiate yet unsatisfied desire, that tub\n"+
		"Both fill'd and running, ravening first the lamb\n"+
		"Longs after for the garbage.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"What, dear sir,\n"+
		"Thus raps you? Are you well?\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"Thanks, madam; well.\n"+
		"To PISANIO\n"+
		"Beseech you, sir, desire\n"+
		"My man's abode where I did leave him: he\n"+
		"Is strange and peevish.\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"I was going, sir,\n"+
		"To give him welcome.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"Continues well my lord? His health, beseech you?\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"Well, madam.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"Is he disposed to mirth? I hope he is.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"Exceeding pleasant; none a stranger there\n"+
		"So merry and so gamesome: he is call'd\n"+
		"The Briton reveller.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"When he was here,\n"+
		"He did incline to sadness, and oft-times\n"+
		"Not knowing why.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"I never saw him sad.\n"+
		"There is a Frenchman his companion, one\n"+
		"An eminent monsieur, that, it seems, much loves\n"+
		"A Gallian girl at home; he furnaces\n"+
		"The thick sighs from him, whiles the jolly Briton--\n"+
		"Your lord, I mean--laughs from's free lungs, cries 'O,\n"+
		"Can my sides hold, to think that man, who knows\n"+
		"By history, report, or his own proof,\n"+
		"What woman is, yea, what she cannot choose\n"+
		"But must be, will his free hours languish for\n"+
		"Assured bondage?'\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"Will my lord say so?\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"Ay, madam, with his eyes in flood with laughter:\n"+
		"It is a recreation to be by\n"+
		"And hear him mock the Frenchman. But, heavens know,\n"+
		"Some men are much to blame.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"Not he, I hope.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"Not he: but yet heaven's bounty towards him might\n"+
		"Be used more thankfully. In himself, 'tis much;\n"+
		"In you, which I account his beyond all talents,\n"+
		"Whilst I am bound to wonder, I am bound\n"+
		"To pity too.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"What do you pity, sir?\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"Two creatures heartily.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"Am I one, sir?\n"+
		"You look on me: what wreck discern you in me\n"+
		"Deserves your pity?\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"Lamentable! What,\n"+
		"To hide me from the radiant sun and solace\n"+
		"I' the dungeon by a snuff?\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"I pray you, sir,\n"+
		"Deliver with more openness your answers\n"+
		"To my demands. Why do you pity me?\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"That others do--\n"+
		"I was about to say--enjoy your--But\n"+
		"It is an office of the gods to venge it,\n"+
		"Not mine to speak on 't.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"You do seem to know\n"+
		"Something of me, or what concerns me: pray you,--\n"+
		"Since doubling things go ill often hurts more\n"+
		"Than to be sure they do; for certainties\n"+
		"Either are past remedies, or, timely knowing,\n"+
		"The remedy then born--discover to me\n"+
		"What both you spur and stop.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"Had I this cheek\n"+
		"To bathe my lips upon; this hand, whose touch,\n"+
		"Whose every touch, would force the feeler's soul\n"+
		"To the oath of loyalty; this object, which\n"+
		"Takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye,\n"+
		"Fixing it only here; should I, damn'd then,\n"+
		"Slaver with lips as common as the stairs\n"+
		"That mount the Capitol; join gripes with hands\n"+
		"Made hard with hourly falsehood--falsehood, as\n"+
		"With labour; then by-peeping in an eye\n"+
		"Base and unlustrous as the smoky light\n"+
		"That's fed with stinking tallow; it were fit\n"+
		"That all the plagues of hell should at one time\n"+
		"Encounter such revolt.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"My lord, I fear,\n"+
		"Has forgot Britain.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"And himself. Not I,\n"+
		"Inclined to this intelligence, pronounce\n"+
		"The beggary of his change; but 'tis your graces\n"+
		"That from pay mutest conscience to my tongue\n"+
		"Charms this report out.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"Let me hear no more.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"O dearest soul! your cause doth strike my heart\n"+
		"With pity, that doth make me sick. A lady\n"+
		"So fair, and fasten'd to an empery,\n"+
		"Would make the great'st king double,--to be partner'd\n"+
		"With tomboys hired with that self-exhibition\n"+
		"Which your own coffers yield! with diseased ventures\n"+
		"That play with all infirmities for gold\n"+
		"Which rottenness can lend nature! such boil'd stuff\n"+
		"As well might poison poison! Be revenged;\n"+
		"Or she that bore you was no queen, and you\n"+
		"Recoil from your great stock.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"Revenged!\n"+
		"How should I be revenged? If this be true,--\n"+
		"As I have such a heart that both mine ears\n"+
		"Must not in haste abuse--if it be true,\n"+
		"How should I be revenged?\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"Should he make me\n"+
		"Live, like Diana's priest, betwixt cold sheets,\n"+
		"Whiles he is vaulting variable ramps,\n"+
		"In your despite, upon your purse? Revenge it.\n"+
		"I dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure,\n"+
		"More noble than that runagate to your bed,\n"+
		"And will continue fast to your affection,\n"+
		"Still close as sure.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"What, ho, Pisanio!\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"Let me my service tender on your lips.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"Away! I do condemn mine ears that have\n"+
		"So long attended thee. If thou wert honourable,\n"+
		"Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue, not\n"+
		"For such an end thou seek'st,--as base as strange.\n"+
		"Thou wrong'st a gentleman, who is as far\n"+
		"From thy report as thou from honour, and\n"+
		"Solicit'st here a lady that disdains\n"+
		"Thee and the devil alike. What ho, Pisanio!\n"+
		"The king my father shall be made acquainted\n"+
		"Of thy assault: if he shall think it fit,\n"+
		"A saucy stranger in his court to mart\n"+
		"As in a Romish stew and to expound\n"+
		"His beastly mind to us, he hath a court\n"+
		"He little cares for and a daughter who\n"+
		"He not respects at all. What, ho, Pisanio!\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"O happy Leonatus! I may say\n"+
		"The credit that thy lady hath of thee\n"+
		"Deserves thy trust, and thy most perfect goodness\n"+
		"Her assured credit. Blessed live you long!\n"+
		"A lady to the worthiest sir that ever\n"+
		"Country call'd his! and you his mistress, only\n"+
		"For the most worthiest fit! Give me your pardon.\n"+
		"I have spoke this, to know if your affiance\n"+
		"Were deeply rooted; and shall make your lord,\n"+
		"That which he is, new o'er: and he is one\n"+
		"The truest manner'd; such a holy witch\n"+
		"That he enchants societies into him;\n"+
		"Half all men's hearts are his.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"You make amends.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"He sits 'mongst men like a descended god:\n"+
		"He hath a kind of honour sets him off,\n"+
		"More than a mortal seeming. Be not angry,\n"+
		"Most mighty princess, that I have adventured\n"+
		"To try your taking a false report; which hath\n"+
		"Honour'd with confirmation your great judgment\n"+
		"In the election of a sir so rare,\n"+
		"Which you know cannot err: the love I bear him\n"+
		"Made me to fan you thus, but the gods made you,\n"+
		"Unlike all others, chaffless. Pray, your pardon.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"All's well, sir: take my power i' the court\n"+
		"for yours.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"My humble thanks. I had almost forgot\n"+
		"To entreat your grace but in a small request,\n"+
		"And yet of moment to, for it concerns\n"+
		"Your lord; myself and other noble friends,\n"+
		"Are partners in the business.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"Pray, what is't?\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"Some dozen Romans of us and your lord--\n"+
		"The best feather of our wing--have mingled sums\n"+
		"To buy a present for the emperor\n"+
		"Which I, the factor for the rest, have done\n"+
		"In France: 'tis plate of rare device, and jewels\n"+
		"Of rich and exquisite form; their values great;\n"+
		"And I am something curious, being strange,\n"+
		"To have them in safe stowage: may it please you\n"+
		"To take them in protection?\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"Willingly;\n"+
		"And pawn mine honour for their safety: since\n"+
		"My lord hath interest in them, I will keep them\n"+
		"In my bedchamber.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"They are in a trunk,\n"+
		"Attended by my men: I will make bold\n"+
		"To send them to you, only for this night;\n"+
		"I must aboard to-morrow.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"O, no, no.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"Yes, I beseech; or I shall short my word\n"+
		"By lengthening my return. From Gallia\n"+
		"I cross'd the seas on purpose and on promise\n"+
		"To see your grace.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"I thank you for your pains:\n"+
		"But not away to-morrow!\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"O, I must, madam:\n"+
		"Therefore I shall beseech you, if you please\n"+
		"To greet your lord with writing, do't to-night:\n"+
		"I have outstood my time; which is material\n"+
		"To the tender of our present.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"I will write.\n"+
		"Send your trunk to me; it shall safe be kept,\n"+
		"And truly yielded you. You're very welcome.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT II\n"+
		"SCENE I. Britain. Before Cymbeline's palace.\n"+
		"Enter CLOTEN and two Lords\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"Was there ever man had such luck! when I kissed the\n"+
		"jack, upon an up-cast to be hit away! I had a\n"+
		"hundred pound on't: and then a whoreson jackanapes\n"+
		"must take me up for swearing; as if I borrowed mine\n"+
		"oaths of him and might not spend them at my pleasure.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"What got he by that? You have broke his pate with\n"+
		"your bowl.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"[Aside] If his wit had been like him that broke it,\n"+
		"it would have run all out.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"When a gentleman is disposed to swear, it is not for\n"+
		"any standers-by to curtail his oaths, ha?\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"No my lord;\n"+
		"Aside\n"+
		"nor crop the ears of them.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"Whoreson dog! I give him satisfaction?\n"+
		"Would he had been one of my rank!\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"[Aside] To have smelt like a fool.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"I am not vexed more at any thing in the earth: a\n"+
		"pox on't! I had rather not be so noble as I am;\n"+
		"they dare not fight with me, because of the queen my\n"+
		"mother: every Jack-slave hath his bellyful of\n"+
		"fighting, and I must go up and down like a cock that\n"+
		"nobody can match.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"[Aside] You are cock and capon too; and you crow,\n"+
		"cock, with your comb on.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"Sayest thou?\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"It is not fit your lordship should undertake every\n"+
		"companion that you give offence to.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"No, I know that: but it is fit I should commit\n"+
		"offence to my inferiors.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"Ay, it is fit for your lordship only.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"Why, so I say.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"Did you hear of a stranger that's come to court to-night?\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"A stranger, and I not know on't!\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"[Aside] He's a strange fellow himself, and knows it\n"+
		"not.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"There's an Italian come; and, 'tis thought, one of\n"+

		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"Leonatus! a banished rascal; and he's another,\n"+
		"whatsoever he be. Who told you of this stranger?\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"One of your lordship's pages.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"Is it fit I went to look upon him? is there no\n"+
		"derogation in't?\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"You cannot derogate, my lord.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"Not easily, I think.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"[Aside] You are a fool granted; therefore your\n"+
		"issues, being foolish, do not derogate.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"Come, I'll go see this Italian: what I have lost\n"+
		"to-day at bowls I'll win to-night of him. Come, go.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"I'll attend your lordship.\n"+
		"Exeunt CLOTEN and First Lord\n"+
		"That such a crafty devil as is his mother\n"+
		"Should yield the world this ass! a woman that\n"+
		"Bears all down with her brain; and this her son\n"+
		"Cannot take two from twenty, for his heart,\n"+
		"And leave eighteen. Alas, poor princess,\n"+
		"Thou divine Imogen, what thou endurest,\n"+
		"Betwixt a father by thy step-dame govern'd,\n"+
		"A mother hourly coining plots, a wooer\n"+
		"More hateful than the foul expulsion is\n"+
		"Of thy dear husband, than that horrid act\n"+
		"Of the divorce he'ld make! The heavens hold firm\n"+
		"The walls of thy dear honour, keep unshaked\n"+
		"That temple, thy fair mind, that thou mayst stand,\n"+
		"To enjoy thy banish'd lord and this great land!\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE II. Imogen's bedchamber in Cymbeline's palace:\n"+
		"a trunk in one corner of it.\n"+
		"IMOGEN in bed, reading; a Lady attending\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"Who's there? my woman Helen?\n"+
		"Lady\n"+
		"Please you, madam\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"What hour is it?\n"+
		"Lady\n"+
		"Almost midnight, madam.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"I have read three hours then: mine eyes are weak:\n"+
		"Fold down the leaf where I have left: to bed:\n"+
		"Take not away the taper, leave it burning;\n"+
		"And if thou canst awake by four o' the clock,\n"+
		"I prithee, call me. Sleep hath seized me wholly\n"+
		"Exit Lady\n"+
		"To your protection I commend me, gods.\n"+
		"From fairies and the tempters of the night\n"+
		"Guard me, beseech ye.\n"+
		"Sleeps. IACHIMO comes from the trunk\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"The crickets sing, and man's o'er-labour'd sense\n"+
		"Repairs itself by rest. Our Tarquin thus\n"+
		"Did softly press the rushes, ere he waken'd\n"+
		"The chastity he wounded. Cytherea,\n"+
		"How bravely thou becomest thy bed, fresh lily,\n"+
		"And whiter than the sheets! That I might touch!\n"+
		"But kiss; one kiss! Rubies unparagon'd,\n"+
		"How dearly they do't! 'Tis her breathing that\n"+
		"Perfumes the chamber thus: the flame o' the taper\n"+
		"Bows toward her, and would under-peep her lids,\n"+
		"To see the enclosed lights, now canopied\n"+
		"Under these windows, white and azure laced\n"+
		"With blue of heaven's own tinct. But my design,\n"+
		"To note the chamber: I will write all down:\n"+
		"Such and such pictures; there the window; such\n"+
		"The adornment of her bed; the arras; figures,\n"+
		"Why, such and such; and the contents o' the story.\n"+
		"Ah, but some natural notes about her body,\n"+
		"Above ten thousand meaner moveables\n"+
		"Would testify, to enrich mine inventory.\n"+
		"O sleep, thou ape of death, lie dull upon her!\n"+
		"And be her sense but as a monument,\n"+
		"Thus in a chapel lying! Come off, come off:\n"+
		"Taking off her bracelet\n"+
		"As slippery as the Gordian knot was hard!\n"+
		"'Tis mine; and this will witness outwardly,\n"+
		"As strongly as the conscience does within,\n"+
		"To the madding of her lord. On her left breast\n"+
		"A mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops\n"+
		"I' the bottom of a cowslip: here's a voucher,\n"+
		"Stronger than ever law could make: this secret\n"+
		"Will force him think I have pick'd the lock and ta'en\n"+
		"The treasure of her honour. No more. To what end?\n"+
		"Why should I write this down, that's riveted,\n"+
		"Screw'd to my memory? She hath been reading late\n"+
		"The tale of Tereus; here the leaf's turn'd down\n"+
		"Where Philomel gave up. I have enough:\n"+
		"To the trunk again, and shut the spring of it.\n"+
		"Swift, swift, you dragons of the night, that dawning\n"+
		"May bare the raven's eye! I lodge in fear;\n"+
		"Though this a heavenly angel, hell is here.\n"+
		"Clock strikes\n"+
		"One, two, three: time, time!\n"+
		"Goes into the trunk. The scene closes\n"+
		"Scene III\n"+
		"An ante-chamber adjoining Imogen's apartments.\n"+
		"Enter CLOTEN and Lords\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"Your lordship is the most patient man in loss, the\n"+
		"most coldest that ever turned up ace.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"It would make any man cold to lose.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"But not every man patient after the noble temper of\n"+
		"your lordship. You are most hot and furious when you win.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"Winning will put any man into courage. If I could\n"+
		"get this foolish Imogen, I should have gold enough.\n"+
		"It's almost morning, is't not?\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"Day, my lord.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"I would this music would come: I am advised to give\n"+
		"her music o' mornings; they say it will penetrate.\n"+
		"Enter Musicians\n"+
		"Come on; tune: if you can penetrate her with your\n"+
		"fingering, so; we'll try with tongue too: if none\n"+
		"will do, let her remain; but I'll never give o'er.\n"+
		"First, a very excellent good-conceited thing;\n"+
		"after, a wonderful sweet air, with admirable rich\n"+
		"words to it: and then let her consider.\n"+
		"SONG\n"+
		"Hark, hark! the lark at heaven's gate sings,\n"+
		"And Phoebus 'gins arise,\n"+
		"His steeds to water at those springs\n"+
		"On chaliced flowers that lies;\n"+
		"And winking Mary-buds begin\n"+
		"To ope their golden eyes:\n"+
		"With every thing that pretty is,\n"+
		"My lady sweet, arise:\n"+
		"Arise, arise.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"So, get you gone. If this penetrate, I will\n"+
		"consider your music the better: if it do not, it is\n"+
		"a vice in her ears, which horse-hairs and\n"+
		"calves'-guts, nor the voice of unpaved eunuch to\n"+
		"boot, can never amend.\n"+
		"Exeunt Musicians\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"Here comes the king.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"I am glad I was up so late; for that's the reason I\n"+
		"was up so early: he cannot choose but take this\n"+
		"service I have done fatherly.\n"+
		"Enter CYMBELINE and QUEEN\n"+
		"Good morrow to your majesty and to my gracious mother.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"Attend you here the door of our stern daughter?\n"+
		"Will she not forth?\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"I have assailed her with music, but she vouchsafes no notice.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"The exile of her minion is too new;\n"+
		"She hath not yet forgot him: some more time\n"+
		"Must wear the print of his remembrance out,\n"+
		"And then she's yours.\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"You are most bound to the king,\n"+
		"Who lets go by no vantages that may\n"+
		"Prefer you to his daughter. Frame yourself\n"+
		"To orderly soliciting, and be friended\n"+
		"With aptness of the season; make denials\n"+
		"Increase your services; so seem as if\n"+
		"You were inspired to do those duties which\n"+
		"You tender to her; that you in all obey her,\n"+
		"Save when command to your dismission tends,\n"+
		"And therein you are senseless.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"Senseless! not so.\n"+
		"Enter a Messenger\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"So like you, sir, ambassadors from Rome;\n"+
		"The one is Caius Lucius.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"A worthy fellow,\n"+
		"Albeit he comes on angry purpose now;\n"+
		"But that's no fault of his: we must receive him\n"+
		"According to the honour of his sender;\n"+
		"And towards himself, his goodness forespent on us,\n"+
		"We must extend our notice. Our dear son,\n"+
		"When you have given good morning to your mistress,\n"+
		"Attend the queen and us; we shall have need\n"+
		"To employ you towards this Roman. Come, our queen.\n"+
		"Exeunt all but CLOTEN\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"If she be up, I'll speak with her; if not,\n"+
		"Let her lie still and dream.\n"+
		"Knocks\n"+
		"By your leave, ho!\n"+
		"I Know her women are about her: what\n"+
		"If I do line one of their hands? 'Tis gold\n"+
		"Which buys admittance; oft it doth; yea, and makes\n"+
		"Diana's rangers false themselves, yield up\n"+
		"Their deer to the stand o' the stealer; and 'tis gold\n"+
		"Which makes the true man kill'd and saves the thief;\n"+
		"Nay, sometime hangs both thief and true man: what\n"+
		"Can it not do and undo? I will make\n"+
		"One of her women lawyer to me, for\n"+
		"I yet not understand the case myself.\n"+
		"Knocks\n"+
		"By your leave.\n"+
		"Enter a Lady\n"+
		"Lady\n"+
		"Who's there that knocks?\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"A gentleman.\n"+
		"Lady\n"+
		"No more?\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"Yes, and a gentlewoman's son.\n"+
		"Lady\n"+
		"That's more\n"+
		"Than some, whose tailors are as dear as yours,\n"+
		"Can justly boast of. What's your lordship's pleasure?\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"Your lady's person: is she ready?\n"+
		"Lady\n"+
		"Ay,\n"+
		"To keep her chamber.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"There is gold for you;\n"+
		"Sell me your good report.\n"+
		"Lady\n"+
		"How! my good name? or to report of you\n"+
		"What I shall think is good?--The princess!\n"+
		"Enter IMOGEN\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"Good morrow, fairest: sister, your sweet hand.\n"+
		"Exit Lady\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"Good morrow, sir. You lay out too much pains\n"+
		"For purchasing but trouble; the thanks I give\n"+
		"Is telling you that I am poor of thanks\n"+
		"And scarce can spare them.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"Still, I swear I love you.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"If you but said so, 'twere as deep with me:\n"+
		"If you swear still, your recompense is still\n"+
		"That I regard it not.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"This is no answer.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"But that you shall not say I yield being silent,\n"+
		"I would not speak. I pray you, spare me: 'faith,\n"+
		"I shall unfold equal discourtesy\n"+
		"To your best kindness: one of your great knowing\n"+
		"Should learn, being taught, forbearance.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"To leave you in your madness, 'twere my sin:\n"+
		"I will not.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"Fools are not mad folks.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"Do you call me fool?\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"As I am mad, I do:\n"+
		"If you'll be patient, I'll no more be mad;\n"+
		"That cures us both. I am much sorry, sir,\n"+
		"You put me to forget a lady's manners,\n"+
		"By being so verbal: and learn now, for all,\n"+
		"That I, which know my heart, do here pronounce,\n"+
		"By the very truth of it, I care not for you,\n"+
		"And am so near the lack of charity--\n"+
		"To accuse myself--I hate you; which I had rather\n"+
		"You felt than make't my boast.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"You sin against\n"+
		"Obedience, which you owe your father. For\n"+
		"The contract you pretend with that base wretch,\n"+
		"One bred of alms and foster'd with cold dishes,\n"+
		"With scraps o' the court, it is no contract, none:\n"+
		"And though it be allow'd in meaner parties--\n"+
		"Yet who than he more mean?--to knit their souls,\n"+
		"On whom there is no more dependency\n"+
		"But brats and beggary, in self-figured knot;\n"+
		"Yet you are curb'd from that enlargement by\n"+
		"The consequence o' the crown, and must not soil\n"+
		"The precious note of it with a base slave.\n"+
		"A hilding for a livery, a squire's cloth,\n"+
		"A pantler, not so eminent.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"Profane fellow\n"+
		"Wert thou the son of Jupiter and no more\n"+
		"But what thou art besides, thou wert too base\n"+
		"To be his groom: thou wert dignified enough,\n"+
		"Even to the point of envy, if 'twere made\n"+
		"Comparative for your virtues, to be styled\n"+
		"The under-hangman of his kingdom, and hated\n"+
		"For being preferred so well.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"The south-fog rot him!\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"He never can meet more mischance than come\n"+
		"To be but named of thee. His meanest garment,\n"+
		"That ever hath but clipp'd his body, is dearer\n"+
		"In my respect than all the hairs above thee,\n"+
		"Were they all made such men. How now, Pisanio!\n"+
		"Enter PISANIO\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"'His garment!' Now the devil--\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"To Dorothy my woman hie thee presently--\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"'His garment!'\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"I am sprited with a fool.\n"+
		"Frighted, and anger'd worse: go bid my woman\n"+
		"Search for a jewel that too casually\n"+
		"Hath left mine arm: it was thy master's: 'shrew me,\n"+
		"If I would lose it for a revenue\n"+
		"Of any king's in Europe. I do think\n"+
		"I saw't this morning: confident I am\n"+
		"Last night 'twas on mine arm; I kiss'd it:\n"+
		"I hope it be not gone to tell my lord\n"+
		"That I kiss aught but he.\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"'Twill not be lost.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"I hope so: go and search.\n"+
		"Exit PISANIO\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"You have abused me:\n"+
		"'His meanest garment!'\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"Ay, I said so, sir:\n"+
		"If you will make't an action, call witness to't.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"I will inform your father.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"Your mother too:\n"+
		"She's my good lady, and will conceive, I hope,\n"+
		"But the worst of me. So, I leave you, sir,\n"+
		"To the worst of discontent.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"I'll be revenged:\n"+
		"'His meanest garment!' Well.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"SCENE IV. Rome. Philario's house.\n"+
		"Enter POSTHUMUS and PHILARIO\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"Fear it not, sir: I would I were so sure\n"+
		"To win the king as I am bold her honour\n"+
		"Will remain hers.\n"+
		"PHILARIO\n"+
		"What means do you make to him?\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"Not any, but abide the change of time,\n"+
		"Quake in the present winter's state and wish\n"+
		"That warmer days would come: in these sear'd hopes,\n"+
		"I barely gratify your love; they failing,\n"+
		"I must die much your debtor.\n"+
		"PHILARIO\n"+
		"Your very goodness and your company\n"+
		"O'erpays all I can do. By this, your king\n"+
		"Hath heard of great Augustus: Caius Lucius\n"+
		"Will do's commission throughly: and I think\n"+
		"He'll grant the tribute, send the arrearages,\n"+
		"Or look upon our Romans, whose remembrance\n"+
		"Is yet fresh in their grief.\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"I do believe,\n"+
		"Statist though I am none, nor like to be,\n"+
		"That this will prove a war; and you shall hear\n"+
		"The legions now in Gallia sooner landed\n"+
		"In our not-fearing Britain than have tidings\n"+
		"Of any penny tribute paid. Our countrymen\n"+
		"Are men more order'd than when Julius Caesar\n"+
		"Smiled at their lack of skill, but found\n"+
		"their courage\n"+
		"Worthy his frowning at: their discipline,\n"+
		"Now mingled with their courages, will make known\n"+
		"To their approvers they are people such\n"+
		"That mend upon the world.\n"+
		"Enter IACHIMO\n"+
		"PHILARIO\n"+
		"See! Iachimo!\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"The swiftest harts have posted you by land;\n"+
		"And winds of all the comers kiss'd your sails,\n"+
		"To make your vessel nimble.\n"+
		"PHILARIO\n"+
		"Welcome, sir.\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"I hope the briefness of your answer made\n"+
		"The speediness of your return.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"Your lady\n"+
		"Is one of the fairest that I have look'd upon.\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"And therewithal the best; or let her beauty\n"+
		"Look through a casement to allure false hearts\n"+
		"And be false with them.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"Here are letters for you.\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"Their tenor good, I trust.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"'Tis very like.\n"+
		"PHILARIO\n"+
		"Was Caius Lucius in the Britain court\n"+
		"When you were there?\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"He was expected then,\n"+
		"But not approach'd.\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"All is well yet.\n"+
		"Sparkles this stone as it was wont? or is't not\n"+
		"Too dull for your good wearing?\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"If I had lost it,\n"+
		"I should have lost the worth of it in gold.\n"+
		"I'll make a journey twice as far, to enjoy\n"+
		"A second night of such sweet shortness which\n"+
		"Was mine in Britain, for the ring is won.\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"The stone's too hard to come by.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"Not a whit,\n"+
		"Your lady being so easy.\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"Make not, sir,\n"+
		"Your loss your sport: I hope you know that we\n"+
		"Must not continue friends.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"Good sir, we must,\n"+
		"If you keep covenant. Had I not brought\n"+
		"The knowledge of your mistress home, I grant\n"+
		"We were to question further: but I now\n"+
		"Profess myself the winner of her honour,\n"+
		"Together with your ring; and not the wronger\n"+
		"Of her or you, having proceeded but\n"+
		"By both your wills.\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"If you can make't apparent\n"+
		"That you have tasted her in bed, my hand\n"+
		"And ring is yours; if not, the foul opinion\n"+
		"You had of her pure honour gains or loses\n"+
		"Your sword or mine, or masterless leaves both\n"+
		"To who shall find them.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"Sir, my circumstances,\n"+
		"Being so near the truth as I will make them,\n"+
		"Must first induce you to believe: whose strength\n"+
		"I will confirm with oath; which, I doubt not,\n"+
		"You'll give me leave to spare, when you shall find\n"+
		"You need it not.\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"Proceed.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"First, her bedchamber,--\n"+
		"Where, I confess, I slept not, but profess\n"+
		"Had that was well worth watching--it was hang'd\n"+
		"With tapesty of silk and silver; the story\n"+
		"Proud Cleopatra, when she met her Roman,\n"+
		"And Cydnus swell'd above the banks, or for\n"+
		"The press of boats or pride: a piece of work\n"+
		"So bravely done, so rich, that it did strive\n"+
		"In workmanship and value; which I wonder'd\n"+
		"Could be so rarely and exactly wrought,\n"+
		"Since the true life on't was--\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"This is true;\n"+
		"And this you might have heard of here, by me,\n"+
		"Or by some other.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"More particulars\n"+
		"Must justify my knowledge.\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"So they must,\n"+
		"Or do your honour injury.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"The chimney\n"+
		"Is south the chamber, and the chimney-piece\n"+
		"Chaste Dian bathing: never saw I figures\n"+
		"So likely to report themselves: the cutter\n"+
		"Was as another nature, dumb; outwent her,\n"+
		"Motion and breath left out.\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"This is a thing\n"+
		"Which you might from relation likewise reap,\n"+
		"Being, as it is, much spoke of.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"The roof o' the chamber\n"+
		"With golden cherubins is fretted: her andirons--\n"+
		"I had forgot them--were two winking Cupids\n"+
		"Of silver, each on one foot standing, nicely\n"+
		"Depending on their brands.\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"This is her honour!\n"+
		"Let it be granted you have seen all this--and praise\n"+
		"Be given to your remembrance--the description\n"+
		"Of what is in her chamber nothing saves\n"+
		"The wager you have laid.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"Then, if you can,\n"+
		"Showing the bracelet\n"+
		"Be pale: I beg but leave to air this jewel; see!\n"+
		"And now 'tis up again: it must be married\n"+
		"To that your diamond; I'll keep them.\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"Jove!\n"+
		"Once more let me behold it: is it that\n"+
		"Which I left with her?\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"Sir--I thank her--that:\n"+
		"She stripp'd it from her arm; I see her yet;\n"+
		"Her pretty action did outsell her gift,\n"+
		"And yet enrich'd it too: she gave it me, and said\n"+
		"She prized it once.\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"May be she pluck'd it off\n"+
		"To send it me.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"She writes so to you, doth she?\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"O, no, no, no! 'tis true. Here, take this too;\n"+
		"Gives the ring\n"+
		"It is a basilisk unto mine eye,\n"+
		"Kills me to look on't. Let there be no honour\n"+
		"Where there is beauty; truth, where semblance; love,\n"+
		"Where there's another man: the vows of women\n"+
		"Of no more bondage be, to where they are made,\n"+
		"Than they are to their virtues; which is nothing.\n"+
		"O, above measure false!\n"+
		"PHILARIO\n"+
		"Have patience, sir,\n"+
		"And take your ring again; 'tis not yet won:\n"+
		"It may be probable she lost it; or\n"+
		"Who knows if one of her women, being corrupted,\n"+
		"Hath stol'n it from her?\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"Very true;\n"+
		"And so, I hope, he came by't. Back my ring:\n"+
		"Render to me some corporal sign about her,\n"+
		"More evident than this; for this was stolen.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"By Jupiter, I had it from her arm.\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"Hark you, he swears; by Jupiter he swears.\n"+
		"'Tis true:--nay, keep the ring--'tis true: I am sure\n"+
		"She would not lose it: her attendants are\n"+
		"All sworn and honourable:--they induced to steal it!\n"+
		"And by a stranger!--No, he hath enjoyed her:\n"+
		"The cognizance of her incontinency\n"+
		"Is this: she hath bought the name of whore\n"+
		"thus dearly.\n"+
		"There, take thy hire; and all the fiends of hell\n"+
		"Divide themselves between you!\n"+
		"PHILARIO\n"+
		"Sir, be patient:\n"+
		"This is not strong enough to be believed\n"+
		"Of one persuaded well of--\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"Never talk on't;\n"+
		"She hath been colted by him.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"If you seek\n"+
		"For further satisfying, under her breast--\n"+
		"Worthy the pressing--lies a mole, right proud\n"+
		"Of that most delicate lodging: by my life,\n"+
		"I kiss'd it; and it gave me present hunger\n"+
		"To feed again, though full. You do remember\n"+
		"This stain upon her?\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"Ay, and it doth confirm\n"+
		"Another stain, as big as hell can hold,\n"+
		"Were there no more but it.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"Will you hear more?\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"Spare your arithmetic: never count the turns;\n"+
		"Once, and a million!\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"I'll be sworn--\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"No swearing.\n"+
		"If you will swear you have not done't, you lie;\n"+
		"And I will kill thee, if thou dost deny\n"+
		"Thou'st made me cuckold.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"I'll deny nothing.\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"O, that I had her here, to tear her limb-meal!\n"+
		"I will go there and do't, i' the court, before\n"+
		"Her father. I'll do something--\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"PHILARIO\n"+
		"Quite besides\n"+
		"The government of patience! You have won:\n"+
		"Let's follow him, and pervert the present wrath\n"+
		"He hath against himself.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"With an my heart.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE V. Another room in Philario's house.\n"+
		"Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"Is there no way for men to be but women\n"+
		"Must be half-workers? We are all bastards;\n"+
		"And that most venerable man which I\n"+
		"Did call my father, was I know not where\n"+
		"When I was stamp'd; some coiner with his tools\n"+
		"Made me a counterfeit: yet my mother seem'd\n"+
		"The Dian of that time so doth my wife\n"+
		"The nonpareil of this. O, vengeance, vengeance!\n"+
		"Me of my lawful pleasure she restrain'd\n"+
		"And pray'd me oft forbearance; did it with\n"+
		"A pudency so rosy the sweet view on't\n"+
		"Might well have warm'd old Saturn; that I thought her\n"+
		"As chaste as unsunn'd snow. O, all the devils!\n"+
		"This yellow Iachimo, in an hour,--wast not?--\n"+
		"Or less,--at first?--perchance he spoke not, but,\n"+
		"Like a full-acorn'd boar, a German one,\n"+
		"Cried 'O!' and mounted; found no opposition\n"+
		"But what he look'd for should oppose and she\n"+
		"Should from encounter guard. Could I find out\n"+
		"The woman's part in me! For there's no motion\n"+
		"That tends to vice in man, but I affirm\n"+
		"It is the woman's part: be it lying, note it,\n"+
		"The woman's; flattering, hers; deceiving, hers;\n"+
		"Lust and rank thoughts, hers, hers; revenges, hers;\n"+
		"Ambitions, covetings, change of prides, disdain,\n"+
		"Nice longing, slanders, mutability,\n"+
		"All faults that may be named, nay, that hell knows,\n"+
		"Why, hers, in part or all; but rather, all;\n"+
		"For even to vice\n"+
		"They are not constant but are changing still\n"+
		"One vice, but of a minute old, for one\n"+
		"Not half so old as that. I'll write against them,\n"+
		"Detest them, curse them: yet 'tis greater skill\n"+
		"In a true hate, to pray they have their will:\n"+
		"The very devils cannot plague them better.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"ACT III\n"+
		"SCENE I. Britain. A hall in Cymbeline's palace.\n"+
		"Enter in state, CYMBELINE, QUEEN, CLOTEN, and Lords at one door, and at another, CAIUS LUCIUS and Attendants\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"Now say, what would Augustus Caesar with us?\n"+
		"CAIUS LUCIUS\n"+
		"When Julius Caesar, whose remembrance yet\n"+
		"Lives in men's eyes and will to ears and tongues\n"+
		"Be theme and hearing ever, was in this Britain\n"+
		"And conquer'd it, Cassibelan, thine uncle,--\n"+
		"Famous in Caesar's praises, no whit less\n"+
		"Than in his feats deserving it--for him\n"+
		"And his succession granted Rome a tribute,\n"+
		"Yearly three thousand pounds, which by thee lately\n"+
		"Is left untender'd.\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"And, to kill the marvel,\n"+
		"Shall be so ever.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"There be many Caesars,\n"+
		"Ere such another Julius. Britain is\n"+
		"A world by itself; and we will nothing pay\n"+
		"For wearing our own noses.\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"That opportunity\n"+
		"Which then they had to take from 's, to resume\n"+
		"We have again. Remember, sir, my liege,\n"+
		"The kings your ancestors, together with\n"+
		"The natural bravery of your isle, which stands\n"+
		"As Neptune's park, ribbed and paled in\n"+
		"With rocks unscalable and roaring waters,\n"+
		"With sands that will not bear your enemies' boats,\n"+
		"But suck them up to the topmast. A kind of conquest\n"+
		"Caesar made here; but made not here his brag\n"+
		"Of 'Came' and 'saw' and 'overcame: ' with shame--\n"+
		"That first that ever touch'd him--he was carried\n"+
		"From off our coast, twice beaten; and his shipping--\n"+
		"Poor ignorant baubles!-- upon our terrible seas,\n"+
		"Like egg-shells moved upon their surges, crack'd\n"+
		"As easily 'gainst our rocks: for joy whereof\n"+
		"The famed Cassibelan, who was once at point--\n"+
		"O giglot fortune!--to master Caesar's sword,\n"+
		"Made Lud's town with rejoicing fires bright\n"+
		"And Britons strut with courage.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"Come, there's no more tribute to be paid: our\n"+
		"kingdom is stronger than it was at that time; and,\n"+
		"as I said, there is no moe such Caesars: other of\n"+
		"them may have crook'd noses, but to owe such\n"+
		"straight arms, none.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"Son, let your mother end.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"We have yet many among us can gripe as hard as\n"+
		"Cassibelan: I do not say I am one; but I have a\n"+
		"hand. Why tribute? why should we pay tribute? If\n"+
		"Caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket, or\n"+
		"put the moon in his pocket, we will pay him tribute\n"+
		"for light; else, sir, no more tribute, pray you now.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"You must know,\n"+
		"Till the injurious Romans did extort\n"+
		"This tribute from us, we were free:\n"+
		"Caesar's ambition,\n"+
		"Which swell'd so much that it did almost stretch\n"+
		"The sides o' the world, against all colour here\n"+
		"Did put the yoke upon 's; which to shake off\n"+
		"Becomes a warlike people, whom we reckon\n"+
		"Ourselves to be.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"Lords\n"+
		"We do.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"Say, then, to Caesar,\n"+
		"Our ancestor was that Mulmutius which\n"+
		"Ordain'd our laws, whose use the sword of Caesar\n"+
		"Hath too much mangled; whose repair and franchise\n"+
		"Shall, by the power we hold, be our good deed,\n"+
		"Though Rome be therefore angry: Mulmutius made our laws,\n"+
		"Who was the first of Britain which did put\n"+
		"His brows within a golden crown and call'd\n"+
		"Himself a king.\n"+
		"CAIUS LUCIUS\n"+
		"I am sorry, Cymbeline,\n"+
		"That I am to pronounce Augustus Caesar--\n"+
		"Caesar, that hath more kings his servants than\n"+
		"Thyself domestic officers--thine enemy:\n"+
		"Receive it from me, then: war and confusion\n"+
		"In Caesar's name pronounce I 'gainst thee: look\n"+
		"For fury not to be resisted. Thus defied,\n"+
		"I thank thee for myself.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"Thou art welcome, Caius.\n"+
		"Thy Caesar knighted me; my youth I spent\n"+
		"Much under him; of him I gather'd honour;\n"+
		"Which he to seek of me again, perforce,\n"+
		"Behoves me keep at utterance. I am perfect\n"+
		"That the Pannonians and Dalmatians for\n"+
		"Their liberties are now in arms; a precedent\n"+
		"Which not to read would show the Britons cold:\n"+
		"So Caesar shall not find them.\n"+
		"CAIUS LUCIUS\n"+
		"Let proof speak.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"His majesty bids you welcome. Make\n"+
		"pastime with us a day or two, or longer: if\n"+
		"you seek us afterwards in other terms, you\n"+
		"shall find us in our salt-water girdle: if you\n"+
		"beat us out of it, it is yours; if you fall in\n"+
		"the adventure, our crows shall fare the better\n"+
		"for you; and there's an end.\n"+
		"CAIUS LUCIUS\n"+
		"So, sir.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"I know your master's pleasure and he mine:\n"+
		"All the remain is 'Welcome!'\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. Another room in the palace.\n"+
		"Enter PISANIO, with a letter\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"How? of adultery? Wherefore write you not\n"+
		"What monster's her accuser? Leonatus,\n"+
		"O master! what a strange infection\n"+
		"Is fall'n into thy ear! What false Italian,\n"+
		"As poisonous-tongued as handed, hath prevail'd\n"+
		"On thy too ready hearing? Disloyal! No:\n"+
		"She's punish'd for her truth, and undergoes,\n"+
		"More goddess-like than wife-like, such assaults\n"+
		"As would take in some virtue. O my master!\n"+
		"Thy mind to her is now as low as were\n"+
		"Thy fortunes. How! that I should murder her?\n"+
		"Upon the love and truth and vows which I\n"+
		"Have made to thy command? I, her? her blood?\n"+
		"If it be so to do good service, never\n"+
		"Let me be counted serviceable. How look I,\n"+
		"That I should seem to lack humanity\n"+
		"so much as this fact comes to?\n"+
		"Reading\n"+
		"'Do't: the letter\n"+
		"that I have sent her, by her own command\n"+
		"Shall give thee opportunity.' O damn'd paper!\n"+
		"Black as the ink that's on thee! Senseless bauble,\n"+
		"Art thou a feodary for this act, and look'st\n"+
		"So virgin-like without? Lo, here she comes.\n"+
		"I am ignorant in what I am commanded.\n"+
		"Enter IMOGEN\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"How now, Pisanio!\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"Madam, here is a letter from my lord.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"Who? thy lord? that is my lord, Leonatus!\n"+
		"O, learn'd indeed were that astronomer\n"+
		"That knew the stars as I his characters;\n"+
		"He'ld lay the future open. You good gods,\n"+
		"Let what is here contain'd relish of love,\n"+
		"Of my lord's health, of his content, yet not\n"+
		"That we two are asunder; let that grieve him:\n"+
		"Some griefs are med'cinable; that is one of them,\n"+
		"For it doth physic love: of his content,\n"+
		"All but in that! Good wax, thy leave. Blest be\n"+
		"You bees that make these locks of counsel! Lovers\n"+
		"And men in dangerous bonds pray not alike:\n"+
		"Though forfeiters you cast in prison, yet\n"+
		"You clasp young Cupid's tables. Good news, gods!\n"+
		"Reads\n"+
		"'Justice, and your father's wrath, should he take me\n"+
		"in his dominion, could not be so cruel to me, as\n"+
		"you, O the dearest of creatures, would even renew me\n"+
		"with your eyes. Take notice that I am in Cambria,\n"+
		"at Milford-Haven: what your own love will out of\n"+
		"this advise you, follow. So he wishes you all\n"+
		"happiness, that remains loyal to his vow, and your,\n"+
		"increasing in love,\n"+
		"LEONATUS POSTHUMUS.'\n"+
		"O, for a horse with wings! Hear'st thou, Pisanio?\n"+
		"He is at Milford-Haven: read, and tell me\n"+
		"How far 'tis thither. If one of mean affairs\n"+
		"May plod it in a week, why may not I\n"+
		"Glide thither in a day? Then, true Pisanio,--\n"+
		"Who long'st, like me, to see thy lord; who long'st,--\n"+
		"let me bate,-but not like me--yet long'st,\n"+
		"But in a fainter kind:--O, not like me;\n"+
		"For mine's beyond beyond--say, and speak thick;\n"+
		"Love's counsellor should fill the bores of hearing,\n"+
		"To the smothering of the sense--how far it is\n"+
		"To this same blessed Milford: and by the way\n"+
		"Tell me how Wales was made so happy as\n"+
		"To inherit such a haven: but first of all,\n"+
		"How we may steal from hence, and for the gap\n"+
		"That we shall make in time, from our hence-going\n"+
		"And our return, to excuse: but first, how get hence:\n"+
		"Why should excuse be born or e'er begot?\n"+
		"We'll talk of that hereafter. Prithee, speak,\n"+
		"How many score of miles may we well ride\n"+
		"'Twixt hour and hour?\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"One score 'twixt sun and sun,\n"+
		"Madam, 's enough for you:\n"+
		"Aside\n"+
		"and too much too.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"Why, one that rode to's execution, man,\n"+
		"Could never go so slow: I have heard of\n"+
		"riding wagers,\n"+
		"Where horses have been nimbler than the sands\n"+
		"That run i' the clock's behalf. But this is foolery:\n"+
		"Go bid my woman feign a sickness; say\n"+
		"She'll home to her father: and provide me presently\n"+
		"A riding-suit, no costlier than would fit\n"+
		"A franklin's housewife.\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"Madam, you're best consider.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"I see before me, man: nor here, nor here,\n"+
		"Nor what ensues, but have a fog in them,\n"+
		"That I cannot look through. Away, I prithee;\n"+
		"Do as I bid thee: there's no more to say,\n"+
		"Accessible is none but Milford way.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. Wales: a mountainous country with a cave.\n"+
		"Enter, from the cave, BELARIUS; GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS following\n"+
		"BELARIUS\n"+
		"A goodly day not to keep house, with such\n"+
		"Whose roof's as low as ours! Stoop, boys; this gate\n"+
		"Instructs you how to adore the heavens and bows you\n"+
		"To a morning's holy office: the gates of monarchs\n"+
		"Are arch'd so high that giants may jet through\n"+
		"And keep their impious turbans on, without\n"+
		"Good morrow to the sun. Hail, thou fair heaven!\n"+
		"We house i' the rock, yet use thee not so hardly\n"+
		"As prouder livers do.\n"+
		"GUIDERIUS\n"+
		"Hail, heaven!\n"+
		"ARVIRAGUS\n"+
		"Hail, heaven!\n"+
		"BELARIUS\n"+
		"Now for our mountain sport: up to yond hill;\n"+
		"Your legs are young; I'll tread these flats. Consider,\n"+
		"When you above perceive me like a crow,\n"+
		"That it is place which lessens and sets off;\n"+
		"And you may then revolve what tales I have told you\n"+
		"Of courts, of princes, of the tricks in war:\n"+
		"This service is not service, so being done,\n"+
		"But being so allow'd: to apprehend thus,\n"+
		"Draws us a profit from all things we see;\n"+
		"And often, to our comfort, shall we find\n"+
		"The sharded beetle in a safer hold\n"+
		"Than is the full-wing'd eagle. O, this life\n"+
		"Is nobler than attending for a cheque,\n"+
		"Richer than doing nothing for a bauble,\n"+
		"Prouder than rustling in unpaid-for silk:\n"+
		"Such gain the cap of him that makes 'em fine,\n"+
		"Yet keeps his book uncross'd: no life to ours.\n"+
		"GUIDERIUS\n"+
		"Out of your proof you speak: we, poor unfledged,\n"+
		"Have never wing'd from view o' the nest, nor know not\n"+
		"What air's from home. Haply this life is best,\n"+
		"If quiet life be best; sweeter to you\n"+
		"That have a sharper known; well corresponding\n"+
		"With your stiff age: but unto us it is\n"+
		"A cell of ignorance; travelling a-bed;\n"+
		"A prison for a debtor, that not dares\n"+
		"To stride a limit.\n"+
		"ARVIRAGUS\n"+
		"What should we speak of\n"+
		"When we are old as you? when we shall hear\n"+
		"The rain and wind beat dark December, how,\n"+
		"In this our pinching cave, shall we discourse\n"+
		"The freezing hours away? We have seen nothing;\n"+
		"We are beastly, subtle as the fox for prey,\n"+
		"Like warlike as the wolf for what we eat;\n"+
		"Our valour is to chase what flies; our cage\n"+
		"We make a quire, as doth the prison'd bird,\n"+
		"And sing our bondage freely.\n"+
		"BELARIUS\n"+
		"How you speak!\n"+
		"Did you but know the city's usuries\n"+
		"And felt them knowingly; the art o' the court\n"+
		"As hard to leave as keep; whose top to climb\n"+
		"Is certain falling, or so slippery that\n"+
		"The fear's as bad as falling; the toil o' the war,\n"+
		"A pain that only seems to seek out danger\n"+
		"I' the name of fame and honour; which dies i'\n"+
		"the search,\n"+
		"And hath as oft a slanderous epitaph\n"+
		"As record of fair act; nay, many times,\n"+
		"Doth ill deserve by doing well; what's worse,\n"+
		"Must court'sy at the censure:--O boys, this story\n"+
		"The world may read in me: my body's mark'd\n"+
		"With Roman swords, and my report was once\n"+
		"First with the best of note: Cymbeline loved me,\n"+
		"And when a soldier was the theme, my name\n"+
		"Was not far off: then was I as a tree\n"+
		"Whose boughs did bend with fruit: but in one night,\n"+
		"A storm or robbery, call it what you will,\n"+
		"Shook down my mellow hangings, nay, my leaves,\n"+
		"And left me bare to weather.\n"+
		"GUIDERIUS\n"+
		"Uncertain favour!\n"+
		"BELARIUS\n"+
		"My fault being nothing--as I have told you oft--\n"+
		"But that two villains, whose false oaths prevail'd\n"+
		"Before my perfect honour, swore to Cymbeline\n"+
		"I was confederate with the Romans: so\n"+
		"Follow'd my banishment, and this twenty years\n"+
		"This rock and these demesnes have been my world;\n"+
		"Where I have lived at honest freedom, paid\n"+
		"More pious debts to heaven than in all\n"+
		"The fore-end of my time. But up to the mountains!\n"+
		"This is not hunters' language: he that strikes\n"+
		"The venison first shall be the lord o' the feast;\n"+
		"To him the other two shall minister;\n"+
		"And we will fear no poison, which attends\n"+
		"In place of greater state. I'll meet you in the valleys.\n"+
		"Exeunt GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS\n"+
		"How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature!\n"+
		"These boys know little they are sons to the king;\n"+
		"Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive.\n"+
		"They think they are mine; and though train'd\n"+
		"up thus meanly\n"+
		"I' the cave wherein they bow, their thoughts do hit\n"+
		"The roofs of palaces, and nature prompts them\n"+
		"In simple and low things to prince it much\n"+
		"Beyond the trick of others. This Polydore,\n"+
		"The heir of Cymbeline and Britain, who\n"+
		"The king his father call'd Guiderius,--Jove!\n"+
		"When on my three-foot stool I sit and tell\n"+
		"The warlike feats I have done, his spirits fly out\n"+
		"Into my story: say 'Thus, mine enemy fell,\n"+
		"And thus I set my foot on 's neck;' even then\n"+
		"The princely blood flows in his cheek, he sweats,\n"+
		"Strains his young nerves and puts himself in posture\n"+
		"That acts my words. The younger brother, Cadwal,\n"+
		"Once Arviragus, in as like a figure,\n"+
		"Strikes life into my speech and shows much more\n"+
		"His own conceiving.--Hark, the game is roused!\n"+
		"O Cymbeline! heaven and my conscience knows\n"+
		"Thou didst unjustly banish me: whereon,\n"+
		"At three and two years old, I stole these babes;\n"+
		"Thinking to bar thee of succession, as\n"+
		"Thou reft'st me of my lands. Euriphile,\n"+
		"Thou wast their nurse; they took thee for\n"+
		"their mother,\n"+
		"And every day do honour to her grave:\n"+
		"Myself, Belarius, that am Morgan call'd,\n"+
		"They take for natural father. The game is up.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE IV. Country near Milford-Haven.\n"+
		"Enter PISANIO and IMOGEN\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"Thou told'st me, when we came from horse, the place\n"+
		"Was near at hand: ne'er long'd my mother so\n"+
		"To see me first, as I have now. Pisanio! man!\n"+
		"Where is Posthumus? What is in thy mind,\n"+
		"That makes thee stare thus? Wherefore breaks that sigh\n"+
		"From the inward of thee? One, but painted thus,\n"+
		"Would be interpreted a thing perplex'd\n"+
		"Beyond self-explication: put thyself\n"+
		"Into a havior of less fear, ere wildness\n"+
		"Vanquish my staider senses. What's the matter?\n"+
		"Why tender'st thou that paper to me, with\n"+
		"A look untender? If't be summer news,\n"+
		"Smile to't before; if winterly, thou need'st\n"+
		"But keep that countenance still. My husband's hand!\n"+
		"That drug-damn'd Italy hath out-craftied him,\n"+
		"And he's at some hard point. Speak, man: thy tongue\n"+
		"May take off some extremity, which to read\n"+
		"Would be even mortal to me.\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"Please you, read;\n"+
		"And you shall find me, wretched man, a thing\n"+
		"The most disdain'd of fortune.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"[Reads] 'Thy mistress, Pisanio, hath played the\n"+
		"strumpet in my bed; the testimonies whereof lie\n"+
		"bleeding in me. I speak not out of weak surmises,\n"+
		"but from proof as strong as my grief and as certain\n"+
		"as I expect my revenge. That part thou, Pisanio,\n"+
		"must act for me, if thy faith be not tainted with\n"+
		"the breach of hers. Let thine own hands take away\n"+
		"her life: I shall give thee opportunity at\n"+
		"Milford-Haven. She hath my letter for the purpose\n"+
		"where, if thou fear to strike and to make me certain\n"+
		"it is done, thou art the pandar to her dishonour and\n"+
		"equally to me disloyal.'\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"What shall I need to draw my sword? the paper\n"+
		"Hath cut her throat already. No, 'tis slander,\n"+
		"Whose edge is sharper than the sword, whose tongue\n"+
		"Outvenoms all the worms of Nile, whose breath\n"+
		"Rides on the posting winds and doth belie\n"+
		"All corners of the world: kings, queens and states,\n"+
		"Maids, matrons, nay, the secrets of the grave\n"+
		"This viperous slander enters. What cheer, madam?\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"False to his bed! What is it to be false?\n"+
		"To lie in watch there and to think on him?\n"+
		"To weep 'twixt clock and clock? if sleep\n"+
		"charge nature,\n"+
		"To break it with a fearful dream of him\n"+
		"And cry myself awake? that's false to's bed, is it?\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"Alas, good lady!\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"I false! Thy conscience witness: Iachimo,\n"+
		"Thou didst accuse him of incontinency;\n"+
		"Thou then look'dst like a villain; now methinks\n"+
		"Thy favour's good enough. Some jay of Italy\n"+
		"Whose mother was her painting, hath betray'd him:\n"+
		"Poor I am stale, a garment out of fashion;\n"+
		"And, for I am richer than to hang by the walls,\n"+
		"I must be ripp'd:--to pieces with me!--O,\n"+
		"Men's vows are women's traitors! All good seeming,\n"+
		"By thy revolt, O husband, shall be thought\n"+
		"Put on for villany; not born where't grows,\n"+
		"But worn a bait for ladies.\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"Good madam, hear me.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"True honest men being heard, like false Aeneas,\n"+
		"Were in his time thought false, and Sinon's weeping\n"+
		"Did scandal many a holy tear, took pity\n"+
		"From most true wretchedness: so thou, Posthumus,\n"+
		"Wilt lay the leaven on all proper men;\n"+
		"Goodly and gallant shall be false and perjured\n"+
		"From thy great fall. Come, fellow, be thou honest:\n"+
		"Do thou thy master's bidding: when thou see'st him,\n"+
		"A little witness my obedience: look!\n"+
		"I draw the sword myself: take it, and hit\n"+
		"The innocent mansion of my love, my heart;\n"+
		"Fear not; 'tis empty of all things but grief;\n"+
		"Thy master is not there, who was indeed\n"+
		"The riches of it: do his bidding; strike\n"+
		"Thou mayst be valiant in a better cause;\n"+
		"But now thou seem'st a coward.\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"Hence, vile instrument!\n"+
		"Thou shalt not damn my hand.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"Why, I must die;\n"+
		"And if I do not by thy hand, thou art\n"+
		"No servant of thy master's. Against self-slaughter\n"+
		"There is a prohibition so divine\n"+
		"That cravens my weak hand. Come, here's my heart.\n"+
		"Something's afore't. Soft, soft! we'll no defence;\n"+
		"Obedient as the scabbard. What is here?\n"+
		"The scriptures of the loyal Leonatus,\n"+
		"All turn'd to heresy? Away, away,\n"+
		"Corrupters of my faith! you shall no more\n"+
		"Be stomachers to my heart. Thus may poor fools\n"+
		"Believe false teachers: though those that\n"+
		"are betray'd\n"+
		"Do feel the treason sharply, yet the traitor\n"+
		"Stands in worse case of woe.\n"+
		"And thou, Posthumus, thou that didst set up\n"+
		"My disobedience 'gainst the king my father\n"+
		"And make me put into contempt the suits\n"+
		"Of princely fellows, shalt hereafter find\n"+
		"It is no act of common passage, but\n"+
		"A strain of rareness: and I grieve myself\n"+
		"To think, when thou shalt be disedged by her\n"+
		"That now thou tirest on, how thy memory\n"+
		"Will then be pang'd by me. Prithee, dispatch:\n"+
		"The lamb entreats the butcher: where's thy knife?\n"+
		"Thou art too slow to do thy master's bidding,\n"+
		"When I desire it too.\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"O gracious lady,\n"+
		"Since I received command to do this business\n"+
		"I have not slept one wink.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"Do't, and to bed then.\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"I'll wake mine eye-balls blind first.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"Wherefore then\n"+
		"Didst undertake it? Why hast thou abused\n"+
		"So many miles with a pretence? this place?\n"+
		"Mine action and thine own? our horses' labour?\n"+
		"The time inviting thee? the perturb'd court,\n"+
		"For my being absent? whereunto I never\n"+
		"Purpose return. Why hast thou gone so far,\n"+
		"To be unbent when thou hast ta'en thy stand,\n"+
		"The elected deer before thee?\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"But to win time\n"+
		"To lose so bad employment; in the which\n"+
		"I have consider'd of a course. Good lady,\n"+
		"Hear me with patience.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"Talk thy tongue weary; speak\n"+
		"I have heard I am a strumpet; and mine ear\n"+
		"Therein false struck, can take no greater wound,\n"+
		"Nor tent to bottom that. But speak.\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"Then, madam,\n"+
		"I thought you would not back again.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"Most like;\n"+
		"Bringing me here to kill me.\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"Not so, neither:\n"+
		"But if I were as wise as honest, then\n"+
		"My purpose would prove well. It cannot be\n"+
		"But that my master is abused:\n"+
		"Some villain, ay, and singular in his art.\n"+
		"Hath done you both this cursed injury.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"Some Roman courtezan.\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"No, on my life.\n"+
		"I'll give but notice you are dead and send him\n"+
		"Some bloody sign of it; for 'tis commanded\n"+
		"I should do so: you shall be miss'd at court,\n"+
		"And that will well confirm it.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"Why good fellow,\n"+
		"What shall I do the where? where bide? how live?\n"+
		"Or in my life what comfort, when I am\n"+
		"Dead to my husband?\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"If you'll back to the court--\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"No court, no father; nor no more ado\n"+
		"With that harsh, noble, simple nothing,\n"+
		"That Cloten, whose love-suit hath been to me\n"+
		"As fearful as a siege.\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"If not at court,\n"+
		"Then not in Britain must you bide.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"Where then\n"+
		"Hath Britain all the sun that shines? Day, night,\n"+
		"Are they not but in Britain? I' the world's volume\n"+
		"Our Britain seems as of it, but not in 't;\n"+
		"In a great pool a swan's nest: prithee, think\n"+
		"There's livers out of Britain.\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"I am most glad\n"+
		"You think of other place. The ambassador,\n"+
		"Lucius the Roman, comes to Milford-Haven\n"+
		"To-morrow: now, if you could wear a mind\n"+
		"Dark as your fortune is, and but disguise\n"+
		"That which, to appear itself, must not yet be\n"+
		"But by self-danger, you should tread a course\n"+
		"Pretty and full of view; yea, haply, near\n"+
		"The residence of Posthumus; so nigh at least\n"+
		"That though his actions were not visible, yet\n"+
		"Report should render him hourly to your ear\n"+
		"As truly as he moves.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"O, for such means!\n"+
		"Though peril to my modesty, not death on't,\n"+
		"I would adventure.\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"Well, then, here's the point:\n"+
		"You must forget to be a woman; change\n"+
		"Command into obedience: fear and niceness--\n"+
		"The handmaids of all women, or, more truly,\n"+
		"Woman its pretty self--into a waggish courage:\n"+
		"Ready in gibes, quick-answer'd, saucy and\n"+
		"As quarrelous as the weasel; nay, you must\n"+
		"Forget that rarest treasure of your cheek,\n"+
		"Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!\n"+
		"Alack, no remedy!--to the greedy touch\n"+
		"Of common-kissing Titan, and forget\n"+
		"Your laboursome and dainty trims, wherein\n"+
		"You made great Juno angry.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"Nay, be brief\n"+
		"I see into thy end, and am almost\n"+
		"A man already.\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"First, make yourself but like one.\n"+
		"Fore-thinking this, I have already fit--\n"+
		"'Tis in my cloak-bag--doublet, hat, hose, all\n"+
		"That answer to them: would you in their serving,\n"+
		"And with what imitation you can borrow\n"+
		"From youth of such a season, 'fore noble Lucius\n"+
		"Present yourself, desire his service, tell him\n"+
		"wherein you're happy,--which you'll make him know,\n"+
		"If that his head have ear in music,--doubtless\n"+
		"With joy he will embrace you, for he's honourable\n"+
		"And doubling that, most holy. Your means abroad,\n"+
		"You have me, rich; and I will never fail\n"+
		"Beginning nor supplyment.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"Thou art all the comfort\n"+
		"The gods will diet me with. Prithee, away:\n"+
		"There's more to be consider'd; but we'll even\n"+
		"All that good time will give us: this attempt\n"+
		"I am soldier to, and will abide it with\n"+
		"A prince's courage. Away, I prithee.\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"Well, madam, we must take a short farewell,\n"+
		"Lest, being miss'd, I be suspected of\n"+
		"Your carriage from the court. My noble mistress,\n"+
		"Here is a box; I had it from the queen:\n"+
		"What's in't is precious; if you are sick at sea,\n"+
		"Or stomach-qualm'd at land, a dram of this\n"+
		"Will drive away distemper. To some shade,\n"+
		"And fit you to your manhood. May the gods\n"+
		"Direct you to the best!\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"Amen: I thank thee.\n"+
		"Exeunt, severally\n"+
		"SCENE V. A room in Cymbeline's palace.\n"+
		"Enter CYMBELINE, QUEEN, CLOTEN, LUCIUS, Lords, and Attendants\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"Thus far; and so farewell.\n"+
		"CAIUS LUCIUS\n"+
		"Thanks, royal sir.\n"+
		"My emperor hath wrote, I must from hence;\n"+
		"And am right sorry that I must report ye\n"+
		"My master's enemy.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"Our subjects, sir,\n"+
		"Will not endure his yoke; and for ourself\n"+
		"To show less sovereignty than they, must needs\n"+
		"Appear unkinglike.\n"+
		"CAIUS LUCIUS\n"+
		"So, sir: I desire of you\n"+
		"A conduct over-land to Milford-Haven.\n"+
		"Madam, all joy befal your grace!\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"And you!\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"My lords, you are appointed for that office;\n"+
		"The due of honour in no point omit.\n"+
		"So farewell, noble Lucius.\n"+
		"CAIUS LUCIUS\n"+
		"Your hand, my lord.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"Receive it friendly; but from this time forth\n"+
		"I wear it as your enemy.\n"+
		"CAIUS LUCIUS\n"+
		"Sir, the event\n"+
		"Is yet to name the winner: fare you well.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"Leave not the worthy Lucius, good my lords,\n"+
		"Till he have cross'd the Severn. Happiness!\n"+
		"Exeunt LUCIUS and Lords\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"He goes hence frowning: but it honours us\n"+
		"That we have given him cause.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"'Tis all the better;\n"+
		"Your valiant Britons have their wishes in it.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"Lucius hath wrote already to the emperor\n"+
		"How it goes here. It fits us therefore ripely\n"+
		"Our chariots and our horsemen be in readiness:\n"+
		"The powers that he already hath in Gallia\n"+
		"Will soon be drawn to head, from whence he moves\n"+
		"His war for Britain.\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"'Tis not sleepy business;\n"+
		"But must be look'd to speedily and strongly.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"Our expectation that it would be thus\n"+
		"Hath made us forward. But, my gentle queen,\n"+
		"Where is our daughter? She hath not appear'd\n"+
		"Before the Roman, nor to us hath tender'd\n"+
		"The duty of the day: she looks us like\n"+
		"A thing more made of malice than of duty:\n"+
		"We have noted it. Call her before us; for\n"+
		"We have been too slight in sufferance.\n"+
		"Exit an Attendant\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"Royal sir,\n"+
		"Since the exile of Posthumus, most retired\n"+
		"Hath her life been; the cure whereof, my lord,\n"+
		"'Tis time must do. Beseech your majesty,\n"+
		"Forbear sharp speeches to her: she's a lady\n"+
		"So tender of rebukes that words are strokes\n"+
		"And strokes death to her.\n"+
		"Re-enter Attendant\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"Where is she, sir? How\n"+
		"Can her contempt be answer'd?\n"+
		"Attendant\n"+
		"Please you, sir,\n"+
		"Her chambers are all lock'd; and there's no answer\n"+
		"That will be given to the loudest noise we make.\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"My lord, when last I went to visit her,\n"+
		"She pray'd me to excuse her keeping close,\n"+
		"Whereto constrain'd by her infirmity,\n"+
		"She should that duty leave unpaid to you,\n"+
		"Which daily she was bound to proffer: this\n"+
		"She wish'd me to make known; but our great court\n"+
		"Made me to blame in memory.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"Her doors lock'd?\n"+
		"Not seen of late? Grant, heavens, that which I fear\n"+
		"Prove false!\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"Son, I say, follow the king.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"That man of hers, Pisanio, her old servant,\n"+
		"have not seen these two days.\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"Go, look after.\n"+
		"Exit CLOTEN\n"+
		"Pisanio, thou that stand'st so for Posthumus!\n"+
		"He hath a drug of mine; I pray his absence\n"+
		"Proceed by swallowing that, for he believes\n"+
		"It is a thing most precious. But for her,\n"+
		"Where is she gone? Haply, despair hath seized her,\n"+
		"Or, wing'd with fervor of her love, she's flown\n"+
		"To her desired Posthumus: gone she is\n"+
		"To death or to dishonour; and my end\n"+
		"Can make good use of either: she being down,\n"+
		"I have the placing of the British crown.\n"+
		"Re-enter CLOTEN\n"+
		"How now, my son!\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"'Tis certain she is fled.\n"+
		"Go in and cheer the king: he rages; none\n"+
		"Dare come about him.\n"+
		"QUEEN\n"+
		"[Aside] All the better: may\n"+
		"This night forestall him of the coming day!\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"I love and hate her: for she's fair and royal,\n"+
		"And that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite\n"+
		"Than lady, ladies, woman; from every one\n"+
		"The best she hath, and she, of all compounded,\n"+
		"Outsells them all; I love her therefore: but\n"+
		"Disdaining me and throwing favours on\n"+
		"The low Posthumus slanders so her judgment\n"+
		"That what's else rare is choked; and in that point\n"+
		"I will conclude to hate her, nay, indeed,\n"+
		"To be revenged upon her. For when fools Shall--\n"+
		"Enter PISANIO\n"+
		"Who is here? What, are you packing, sirrah?\n"+
		"Come hither: ah, you precious pander! Villain,\n"+
		"Where is thy lady? In a word; or else\n"+
		"Thou art straightway with the fiends.\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"O, good my lord!\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"Where is thy lady? Or, by Jupiter,--\n"+
		"I will not ask again. Close villain,\n"+
		"I'll have this secret from thy heart, or rip\n"+
		"Thy heart to find it. Is she with Posthumus?\n"+
		"From whose so many weights of baseness cannot\n"+
		"A dram of worth be drawn.\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"Alas, my lord,\n"+
		"How can she be with him? When was she missed?\n"+
		"He is in Rome.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"Where is she, sir? Come nearer;\n"+
		"No further halting: satisfy me home\n"+
		"What is become of her.\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"O, my all-worthy lord!\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"All-worthy villain!\n"+
		"Discover where thy mistress is at once,\n"+
		"At the next word: no more of 'worthy lord!'\n"+
		"Speak, or thy silence on the instant is\n"+
		"Thy condemnation and thy death.\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"Then, sir,\n"+
		"This paper is the history of my knowledge\n"+
		"Touching her flight.\n"+
		"Presenting a letter\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"Let's see't. I will pursue her\n"+
		"Even to Augustus' throne.\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"[Aside] Or this, or perish.\n"+
		"She's far enough; and what he learns by this\n"+
		"May prove his travel, not her danger.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"Hum!\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"[Aside] I'll write to my lord she's dead. O Imogen,\n"+
		"Safe mayst thou wander, safe return again!\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"Sirrah, is this letter true?\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"Sir, as I think.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"It is Posthumus' hand; I know't. Sirrah, if thou\n"+
		"wouldst not be a villain, but do me true service,\n"+
		"undergo those employments wherein I should have\n"+
		"cause to use thee with a serious industry, that is,\n"+
		"what villany soe'er I bid thee do, to perform it\n"+
		"directly and truly, I would think thee an honest\n"+
		"man: thou shouldst neither want my means for thy\n"+
		"relief nor my voice for thy preferment.\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"Well, my good lord.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"Wilt thou serve me? for since patiently and\n"+
		"constantly thou hast stuck to the bare fortune of\n"+
		"that beggar Posthumus, thou canst not, in the\n"+
		"course of gratitude, but be a diligent follower of\n"+
		"mine: wilt thou serve me?\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"Sir, I will.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"Give me thy hand; here's my purse. Hast any of thy\n"+
		"late master's garments in thy possession?\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"I have, my lord, at my lodging, the same suit he\n"+
		"wore when he took leave of my lady and mistress.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"The first service thou dost me, fetch that suit\n"+
		"hither: let it be thy lint service; go.\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"I shall, my lord.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"Meet thee at Milford-Haven!--I forgot to ask him one\n"+
		"thing; I'll remember't anon:--even there, thou\n"+
		"villain Posthumus, will I kill thee. I would these\n"+
		"garments were come. She said upon a time--the\n"+
		"bitterness of it I now belch from my heart--that she\n"+
		"held the very garment of Posthumus in more respect\n"+
		"than my noble and natural person together with the\n"+
		"adornment of my qualities. With that suit upon my\n"+
		"back, will I ravish her: first kill him, and in her\n"+
		"eyes; there shall she see my valour, which will then\n"+
		"be a torment to her contempt. He on the ground, my\n"+
		"speech of insultment ended on his dead body, and\n"+
		"when my lust hath dined,--which, as I say, to vex\n"+
		"her I will execute in the clothes that she so\n"+
		"praised,--to the court I'll knock her back, foot\n"+
		"her home again. She hath despised me rejoicingly,\n"+
		"and I'll be merry in my revenge.\n"+
		"Re-enter PISANIO, with the clothes\n"+
		"Be those the garments?\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"Ay, my noble lord.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"How long is't since she went to Milford-Haven?\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"She can scarce be there yet.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"Bring this apparel to my chamber; that is the second\n"+
		"thing that I have commanded thee: the third is,\n"+
		"that thou wilt be a voluntary mute to my design. Be\n"+
		"but duteous, and true preferment shall tender itself\n"+
		"to thee. My revenge is now at Milford: would I had\n"+
		"wings to follow it! Come, and be true.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"Thou bid'st me to my loss: for true to thee\n"+
		"Were to prove false, which I will never be,\n"+
		"To him that is most true. To Milford go,\n"+
		"And find not her whom thou pursuest. Flow, flow,\n"+
		"You heavenly blessings, on her! This fool's speed\n"+
		"Be cross'd with slowness; labour be his meed!\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE VI. Wales. Before the cave of Belarius.\n"+
		"Enter IMOGEN, in boy's clothes\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"I see a man's life is a tedious one:\n"+
		"I have tired myself, and for two nights together\n"+
		"Have made the ground my bed. I should be sick,\n"+
		"But that my resolution helps me. Milford,\n"+
		"When from the mountain-top Pisanio show'd thee,\n"+
		"Thou wast within a ken: O Jove! I think\n"+
		"Foundations fly the wretched; such, I mean,\n"+
		"Where they should be relieved. Two beggars told me\n"+
		"I could not miss my way: will poor folks lie,\n"+
		"That have afflictions on them, knowing 'tis\n"+
		"A punishment or trial? Yes; no wonder,\n"+
		"When rich ones scarce tell true. To lapse in fulness\n"+
		"Is sorer than to lie for need, and falsehood\n"+
		"Is worse in kings than beggars. My dear lord!\n"+
		"Thou art one o' the false ones. Now I think on thee,\n"+
		"My hunger's gone; but even before, I was\n"+
		"At point to sink for food. But what is this?\n"+
		"Here is a path to't: 'tis some savage hold:\n"+
		"I were best not to call; I dare not call:\n"+
		"yet famine,\n"+
		"Ere clean it o'erthrow nature, makes it valiant,\n"+
		"Plenty and peace breeds cowards: hardness ever\n"+
		"Of hardiness is mother. Ho! who's here?\n"+
		"If any thing that's civil, speak; if savage,\n"+
		"Take or lend. Ho! No answer? Then I'll enter.\n"+
		"Best draw my sword: and if mine enemy\n"+
		"But fear the sword like me, he'll scarcely look on't.\n"+
		"Such a foe, good heavens!\n"+
		"Exit, to the cave\n"+
		"Enter BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS\n"+
		"BELARIUS\n"+
		"You, Polydote, have proved best woodman and\n"+
		"Are master of the feast: Cadwal and I\n"+
		"Will play the cook and servant; 'tis our match:\n"+

		"But for the end it works to. Come; our stomachs\n"+
		"Will make what's homely savoury: weariness\n"+

		"'Gainst the Pannonians and Dalmatians,\n"+
		"And that the legions now in Gallia are\n"+

		"The gentry to this business. He creates\n"+
		"Lucius preconsul: and to you the tribunes,\n"+
		"For this immediate levy, he commends\n"+
		"His absolute commission. Long live Caesar!\n"+
		"First Tribune\n"+
		"Is Lucius general of the forces?\n"+
		"Second Senator\n"+
		"Ay.\n"+
		"First Tribune\n"+
		"Remaining now in Gallia?\n"+
		"First Senator\n"+
		"With those legions\n"+
		"Which I have spoke of, whereunto your levy\n"+
		"Must be supplyant: the words of your commission\n"+

		"Of their dispatch.\n"+

		"Enter CLOTEN\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"I am near to the place where they should meet, if\n"+
		"Pisanio have mapped it truly. How fit his garments\n"+
		"serve me! Why should his mistress, who was made by\n"+
		"him that made the tailor, not be fit too? the\n"+
		"rather--saving reverence of the word--for 'tis said\n"+
		"a woman's fitness comes by fits. Therein I must\n"+
		"play the workman. I dare speak it to myself--for it\n"+
		"is not vain-glory for a man and his glass to confer\n"+
		"in his own chamber--I mean, the lines of my body are\n"+
		"as well drawn as his; no less young, more strong,\n"+
		"not beneath him in fortunes, beyond him in the\n"+
		"advantage of the time, above him in birth, alike\n"+
		"conversant in general services, and more remarkable\n"+
		"in single oppositions: yet this imperceiverant\n"+
		"thing loves him in my despite. What mortality is!\n"+
		"Posthumus, thy head, which now is growing upon thy\n"+
		"shoulders, shall within this hour be off; thy\n"+
		"mistress enforced; thy garments cut to pieces before\n"+
		"thy face: and all this done, spurn her home to her\n"+
		"father; who may haply be a little angry for my so\n"+
		"rough usage; but my mother, having power of his\n"+
		"testiness, shall turn all into my commendations. My\n"+
		"horse is tied up safe: out, sword, and to a sore\n"+
		"purpose! Fortune, put them into my hand! This is\n"+
		"the very description of their meeting-place; and\n"+
		"the fellow dares not deceive me.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE II. Before the cave of Belarius.\n"+
		"Enter, from the cave, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, ARVIRAGUS, and IMOGEN\n"+
		"BELARIUS\n"+
		"[To IMOGEN] You are not well: remain here in the cave;\n"+
		"We'll come to you after hunting.\n"+
		"ARVIRAGUS\n"+
		"[To IMOGEN] Brother, stay here\n"+
		"Are we not brothers?\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"So man and man should be;\n"+
		"But clay and clay differs in dignity,\n"+
		"Whose dust is both alike. I am very sick.\n"+
		"GUIDERIUS\n"+
		"Go you to hunting; I'll abide with him.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"So sick I am not, yet I am not well;\n"+
		"But not so citizen a wanton as\n"+
		"To seem to die ere sick: so please you, leave me;\n"+
		"Stick to your journal course: the breach of custom\n"+
		"Is breach of all. I am ill, but your being by me\n"+
		"Cannot amend me; society is no comfort\n"+
		"To one not sociable: I am not very sick,\n"+
		"Since I can reason of it. Pray you, trust me here:\n"+
		"I'll rob none but myself; and let me die,\n"+
		"Stealing so poorly.\n"+
		"GUIDERIUS\n"+
		"I love thee; I have spoke it\n"+
		"How much the quantity, the weight as much,\n"+
		"As I do love my father.\n"+
		"BELARIUS\n"+
		"What! how! how!\n"+
		"ARVIRAGUS\n"+
		"If it be sin to say so, I yoke me\n"+
		"In my good brother's fault: I know not why\n"+
		"I love this youth; and I have heard you say,\n"+
		"Love's reason's without reason: the bier at door,\n"+
		"And a demand who is't shall die, I'd say\n"+
		"'My father, not this youth.'\n"+
		"BELARIUS\n"+
		"[Aside] O noble strain!\n"+
		"O worthiness of nature! breed of greatness!\n"+
		"Cowards father cowards and base things sire base:\n"+

		"Brother, farewell.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"I wish ye sport.\n"+
		"ARVIRAGUS\n"+
		"You health. So please you, sir.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"[Aside] These are kind creatures. Gods, what lies\n"+
		"I have heard!\n"+
		"Our courtiers say all's savage but at court:\n"+
		"Experience, O, thou disprovest report!\n"+
		"The imperious seas breed monsters, for the dish\n"+
		"Poor tributary rivers as sweet fish.\n"+
		"I am sick still; heart-sick. Pisanio,\n"+
		"I'll now taste of thy drug.\n"+
		"Swallows some\n"+
		"GUIDERIUS\n"+
		"I could not stir him:\n"+
		"He said he was gentle, but unfortunate;\n"+
		"Dishonestly afflicted, but yet honest.\n"+
		"ARVIRAGUS\n"+
		"Thus did he answer me: yet said, hereafter\n"+
		"I might know more.\n"+
		"BELARIUS\n"+
		"To the field, to the field!\n"+
		"We'll leave you for this time: go in and rest.\n"+
		"ARVIRAGUS\n"+
		"We'll not be long away.\n"+
		"BELARIUS\n"+
		"Pray, be not sick,\n"+
		"For you must be our housewife.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"Well or ill,\n"+
		"I am bound to you.\n"+
		"BELARIUS\n"+
		"And shalt be ever.\n"+
		"Exit IMOGEN, to the cave\n"+
		"This youth, how'er distress'd, appears he hath had\n"+
		"Good ancestors.\n"+
		"ARVIRAGUS\n"+
		"How angel-like he sings!\n"+
		"GUIDERIUS\n"+
		"But his neat cookery! he cut our roots\n"+
		"In characters,\n"+
		"And sauced our broths, as Juno had been sick\n"+
		"And he her dieter.\n"+
		"ARVIRAGUS\n"+
		"Nobly he yokes\n"+
		"A smiling with a sigh, as if the sigh\n"+
		"Was that it was, for not being such a smile;\n"+
		"The smile mocking the sigh, that it would fly\n"+
		"From so divine a temple, to commix\n"+
		"With winds that sailors rail at.\n"+
		"GUIDERIUS\n"+
		"I do note\n"+
		"That grief and patience, rooted in him both,\n"+
		"Mingle their spurs together.\n"+
		"ARVIRAGUS\n"+
		"Grow, patience!\n"+
		"And let the stinking elder, grief, untwine\n"+
		"His perishing root with the increasing vine!\n"+
		"BELARIUS\n"+
		"It is great morning. Come, away!--\n"+
		"Who's there?\n"+
		"Enter CLOTEN\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"I cannot find those runagates; that villain\n"+
		"Hath mock'd me. I am faint.\n"+
		"BELARIUS\n"+
		"'Those runagates!'\n"+
		"Means he not us? I partly know him: 'tis\n"+
		"Cloten, the son o' the queen. I fear some ambush.\n"+
		"I saw him not these many years, and yet\n"+
		"I know 'tis he. We are held as outlaws: hence!\n"+
		"GUIDERIUS\n"+
		"He is but one: you and my brother search\n"+
		"What companies are near: pray you, away;\n"+
		"Let me alone with him.\n"+
		"Exeunt BELARIUS and ARVIRAGUS\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"Soft! What are you\n"+
		"That fly me thus? some villain mountaineers?\n"+
		"I have heard of such. What slave art thou?\n"+
		"GUIDERIUS\n"+
		"A thing\n"+
		"More slavish did I ne'er than answering\n"+
		"A slave without a knock.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"Thou art a robber,\n"+
		"A law-breaker, a villain: yield thee, thief.\n"+
		"GUIDERIUS\n"+
		"To who? to thee? What art thou? Have not I\n"+
		"An arm as big as thine? a heart as big?\n"+
		"Thy words, I grant, are bigger, for I wear not\n"+
		"My dagger in my mouth. Say what thou art,\n"+
		"Why I should yield to thee?\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"Thou villain base,\n"+
		"Know'st me not by my clothes?\n"+
		"GUIDERIUS\n"+
		"No, nor thy tailor, rascal,\n"+
		"Who is thy grandfather: he made those clothes,\n"+
		"Which, as it seems, make thee.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"Thou precious varlet,\n"+
		"My tailor made them not.\n"+
		"GUIDERIUS\n"+
		"Hence, then, and thank\n"+
		"The man that gave them thee. Thou art some fool;\n"+
		"I am loath to beat thee.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"Thou injurious thief,\n"+
		"Hear but my name, and tremble.\n"+
		"GUIDERIUS\n"+
		"What's thy name?\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"Cloten, thou villain.\n"+
		"GUIDERIUS\n"+
		"Cloten, thou double villain, be thy name,\n"+
		"I cannot tremble at it: were it Toad, or\n"+
		"Adder, Spider,\n"+
		"'Twould move me sooner.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"To thy further fear,\n"+
		"Nay, to thy mere confusion, thou shalt know\n"+
		"I am son to the queen.\n"+
		"GUIDERIUS\n"+
		"I am sorry for 't; not seeming\n"+
		"So worthy as thy birth.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"Art not afeard?\n"+
		"GUIDERIUS\n"+
		"Those that I reverence those I fear, the wise:\n"+
		"At fools I laugh, not fear them.\n"+
		"CLOTEN\n"+
		"Die the death:\n"+
		"When I have slain thee with my proper hand,\n"+
		"I'll follow those that even now fled hence,\n"+
		"And on the gates of Lud's-town set your heads:\n"+
		"Yield, rustic mountaineer.\n"+
		"Exeunt, fighting\n"+
		"Re-enter BELARIUS and ARVIRAGUS\n"+
		"BELARIUS\n"+
		"No companies abroad?\n"+
		"ARVIRAGUS\n"+
		"None in the world: you did mistake him, sure.\n"+
		"BELARIUS\n"+
		"I cannot tell: long is it since I saw him,\n"+
		"But time hath nothing blurr'd those lines of favour\n"+
		"Which then he wore; the snatches in his voice,\n"+
		"And burst of speaking, were as his: I am absolute\n"+
		"'Twas very Cloten.\n"+
		"ARVIRAGUS\n"+
		"In this place we left them:\n"+
		"I wish my brother make good time with him,\n"+
		"You say he is so fell.\n"+
		"BELARIUS\n"+
		"Being scarce made up,\n"+
		"I mean, to man, he had not apprehension\n"+
		"Of roaring terrors; for the effect of judgment\n"+
		"Is oft the cause of fear. But, see, thy brother.\n"+
		"Re-enter GUIDERIUS, with CLOTEN'S head\n"+
		"GUIDERIUS\n"+
		"This Cloten was a fool, an empty purse;\n"+
		"There was no money in't: not Hercules\n"+
		"Could have knock'd out his brains, for he had none:\n"+
		"Yet I not doing this, the fool had borne\n"+
		"My head as I do his.\n"+
		"BELARIUS\n"+
		"What hast thou done?\n"+
		"GUIDERIUS\n"+
		"I am perfect what: cut off one Cloten's head,\n"+
		"Son to the queen, after his own report;\n"+
		"Who call'd me traitor, mountaineer, and swore\n"+
		"With his own single hand he'ld take us in\n"+
		"Displace our heads where--thank the gods!--they grow,\n"+
		"And set them on Lud's-town.\n"+
		"BELARIUS\n"+
		"We are all undone.\n"+
		"GUIDERIUS\n"+
		"Why, worthy father, what have we to lose,\n"+
		"But that he swore to take, our lives? The law\n"+
		"Protects not us: then why should we be tender\n"+
		"To let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us,\n"+
		"Play judge and executioner all himself,\n"+
		"For we do fear the law? What company\n"+
		"Discover you abroad?\n"+
		"BELARIUS\n"+
		"No single soul\n"+
		"Can we set eye on; but in all safe reason\n"+
		"He must have some attendants. Though his humour\n"+
		"Was nothing but mutation, ay, and that\n"+
		"From one bad thing to worse; not frenzy, not\n"+
		"Absolute madness could so far have raved\n"+
		"To bring him here alone; although perhaps\n"+
		"It may be heard at court that such as we\n"+
		"Cave here, hunt here, are outlaws, and in time\n"+
		"May make some stronger head; the which he hearing--\n"+
		"As it is like him--might break out, and swear\n"+
		"He'ld fetch us in; yet is't not probable\n"+
		"To come alone, either he so undertaking,\n"+
		"Or they so suffering: then on good ground we fear,\n"+
		"If we do fear this body hath a tail\n"+
		"More perilous than the head.\n"+
		"ARVIRAGUS\n"+
		"Let ordinance\n"+
		"Come as the gods foresay it: howsoe'er,\n"+
		"My brother hath done well.\n"+
		"BELARIUS\n"+
		"I had no mind\n"+
		"To hunt this day: the boy Fidele's sickness\n"+
		"Did make my way long forth.\n"+
		"GUIDERIUS\n"+
		"With his own sword,\n"+
		"Which he did wave against my throat, I have ta'en\n"+
		"His head from him: I'll throw't into the creek\n"+
		"Behind our rock; and let it to the sea,\n"+
		"And tell the fishes he's the queen's son, Cloten:\n"+
		"That's all I reck.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"BELARIUS\n"+
		"I fear 'twill be revenged:\n"+
		"Would, Polydote, thou hadst not done't! though valour\n"+
		"Becomes thee well enough.\n"+
		"ARVIRAGUS\n"+
		"Would I had done't\n"+
		"So the revenge alone pursued me! Polydore,\n"+
		"I love thee brotherly, but envy much\n"+
		"Thou hast robb'd me of this deed: I would revenges,\n"+
		"That possible strength might meet, would seek us through\n"+
		"And put us to our answer.\n"+
		"BELARIUS\n"+
		"Well, 'tis done:\n"+
		"We'll hunt no more to-day, nor seek for danger\n"+
		"Where there's no profit. I prithee, to our rock;\n"+
		"You and Fidele play the cooks: I'll stay\n"+
		"Till hasty Polydote return, and bring him\n"+
		"To dinner presently.\n"+
		"ARVIRAGUS\n"+
		"Poor sick Fidele!\n"+
		"I'll weringly to him: to gain his colour\n"+
		"I'ld let a parish of such Clotens' blood,\n"+
		"And praise myself for charity.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"BELARIUS\n"+
		"O thou goddess,\n"+
		"Thou divine Nature, how thyself thou blazon'st\n"+
		"In these two princely boys! They are as gentle\n"+
		"As zephyrs blowing below the violet,\n"+
		"Not wagging his sweet head; and yet as rough,\n"+
		"Their royal blood enchafed, as the rudest wind,\n"+
		"That by the top doth take the mountain pine,\n"+
		"And make him stoop to the vale. 'Tis wonder\n"+
		"That an invisible instinct should frame them\n"+
		"To royalty unlearn'd, honour untaught,\n"+
		"Civility not seen from other, valour\n"+
		"That wildly grows in them, but yields a crop\n"+
		"As if it had been sow'd. Yet still it's strange\n"+
		"What Cloten's being here to us portends,\n"+
		"Or what his death will bring us.\n"+
		"Re-enter GUIDERIUS\n"+
		"GUIDERIUS\n"+
		"Where's my brother?\n"+
		"I have sent Cloten's clotpoll down the stream,\n"+
		"In embassy to his mother: his body's hostage\n"+
		"For his return.\n"+
		"Solemn music\n"+
		"BELARIUS\n"+
		"My ingenious instrument!\n"+
		"Hark, Polydore, it sounds! But what occasion\n"+
		"Hath Cadwal now to give it motion? Hark!\n"+
		"GUIDERIUS\n"+
		"Is he at home?\n"+
		"BELARIUS\n"+
		"He went hence even now.\n"+
		"GUIDERIUS\n"+
		"What does he mean? since death of my dear'st mother\n"+
		"it did not speak before. All solemn things\n"+
		"Should answer solemn accidents. The matter?\n"+
		"Triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys\n"+
		"Is jollity for apes and grief for boys.\n"+
		"Is Cadwal mad?\n"+
		"BELARIUS\n"+
		"Look, here he comes,\n"+
		"And brings the dire occasion in his arms\n"+
		"Of what we blame him for.\n"+
		"Re-enter ARVIRAGUS, with IMOGEN, as dead, bearing her in his arms\n"+
		"ARVIRAGUS\n"+
		"The bird is dead\n"+
		"That we have made so much on. I had rather\n"+
		"Have skipp'd from sixteen years of age to sixty,\n"+
		"To have turn'd my leaping-time into a crutch,\n"+
		"Than have seen this.\n"+
		"GUIDERIUS\n"+
		"O sweetest, fairest lily!\n"+
		"My brother wears thee not the one half so well\n"+
		"As when thou grew'st thyself.\n"+
		"BELARIUS\n"+
		"O melancholy!\n"+
		"Who ever yet could sound thy bottom? find\n"+
		"The ooze, to show what coast thy sluggish crare\n"+
		"Might easiliest harbour in? Thou blessed thing!\n"+
		"Jove knows what man thou mightst have made; but I,\n"+
		"Thou diedst, a most rare boy, of melancholy.\n"+
		"How found you him?\n"+
		"ARVIRAGUS\n"+
		"Stark, as you see:\n"+
		"Thus smiling, as some fly hid tickled slumber,\n"+
		"Not as death's dart, being laugh'd at; his\n"+
		"right cheek\n"+
		"Reposing on a cushion.\n"+
		"GUIDERIUS\n"+
		"Where?\n"+
		"ARVIRAGUS\n"+
		"O' the floor;\n"+
		"His arms thus leagued: I thought he slept, and put\n"+
		"My clouted brogues from off my feet, whose rudeness\n"+
		"Answer'd my steps too loud.\n"+
		"GUIDERIUS\n"+
		"Why, he but sleeps:\n"+
		"If he be gone, he'll make his grave a bed;\n"+
		"With female fairies will his tomb be haunted,\n"+
		"And worms will not come to thee.\n"+
		"ARVIRAGUS\n"+
		"With fairest flowers\n"+
		"Whilst summer lasts and I live here, Fidele,\n"+
		"I'll sweeten thy sad grave: thou shalt not lack\n"+
		"The flower that's like thy face, pale primrose, nor\n"+
		"The azured harebell, like thy veins, no, nor\n"+
		"The leaf of eglantine, whom not to slander,\n"+
		"Out-sweeten'd not thy breath: the ruddock would,\n"+
		"With charitable bill,--O bill, sore-shaming\n"+
		"Those rich-left heirs that let their fathers lie\n"+
		"Without a monument!--bring thee all this;\n"+
		"Yea, and furr'd moss besides, when flowers are none,\n"+
		"To winter-ground thy corse.\n"+
		"GUIDERIUS\n"+
		"Prithee, have done;\n"+
		"And do not play in wench-like words with that\n"+
		"Which is so serious. Let us bury him,\n"+
		"And not protract with admiration what\n"+
		"Is now due debt. To the grave!\n"+
		"ARVIRAGUS\n"+
		"Say, where shall's lay him?\n"+
		"GUIDERIUS\n"+
		"By good Euriphile, our mother.\n"+
		"ARVIRAGUS\n"+
		"Be't so:\n"+
		"And let us, Polydore, though now our voices\n"+
		"Have got the mannish crack, sing him to the ground,\n"+
		"As once our mother; use like note and words,\n"+
		"Save that Euriphile must be Fidele.\n"+
		"GUIDERIUS\n"+
		"Cadwal,\n"+
		"I cannot sing: I'll weep, and word it with thee;\n"+
		"For notes of sorrow out of tune are worse\n"+
		"Than priests and fanes that lie.\n"+
		"ARVIRAGUS\n"+
		"We'll speak it, then.\n"+
		"BELARIUS\n"+
		"Great griefs, I see, medicine the less; for Cloten\n"+
		"Is quite forgot. He was a queen's son, boys;\n"+
		"And though he came our enemy, remember\n"+
		"He was paid for that: though mean and\n"+
		"mighty, rotting\n"+
		"Together, have one dust, yet reverence,\n"+
		"That angel of the world, doth make distinction\n"+
		"Of place 'tween high and low. Our foe was princely\n"+
		"And though you took his life, as being our foe,\n"+
		"Yet bury him as a prince.\n"+
		"GUIDERIUS\n"+
		"Pray You, fetch him hither.\n"+
		"Thersites' body is as good as Ajax',\n"+
		"When neither are alive.\n"+
		"ARVIRAGUS\n"+
		"If you'll go fetch him,\n"+
		"We'll say our song the whilst. Brother, begin.\n"+
		"Exit BELARIUS\n"+
		"GUIDERIUS\n"+
		"Nay, Cadwal, we must lay his head to the east;\n"+
		"My father hath a reason for't.\n"+
		"ARVIRAGUS\n"+
		"'Tis true.\n"+
		"GUIDERIUS\n"+
		"Come on then, and remove him.\n"+
		"ARVIRAGUS\n"+
		"So. Begin.\n"+

		"Fear no more the heat o' the sun,\n"+
		"Nor the furious winter's rages;\n"+
		"Thou thy worldly task hast done,\n"+
		"Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages:\n"+
		"Golden lads and girls all must,\n"+
		"As chimney-sweepers, come to dust.\n"+
		"ARVIRAGUS\n"+

		"I thank you.--By yond bush?--Pray, how far thither?\n"+

		"I have gone all night. 'Faith, I'll lie down and sleep.\n"+
		"But, soft! no bedfellow!--O god s and goddesses!\n"+
		"Seeing the body of CLOTEN\n"+
		"These flowers are like the pleasures of the world;\n"+
		"This bloody man, the care on't. I hope I dream;\n"+
		"For so I thought I was a cave-keeper,\n"+
		"And cook to honest creatures: but 'tis not so;\n"+
		"'Twas but a bolt of nothing, shot at nothing,\n"+
		"Which the brain makes of fumes: our very eyes\n"+
		"Are sometimes like our judgments, blind. Good faith,\n"+

		"That we the horrider may seem to those\n"+

		"Captain\n"+
		"The senate hath stirr'd up the confiners\n"+

		"CAIUS LUCIUS\n"+
		"When expect you them?\n"+
		"Captain\n"+
		"With the next benefit o' the wind.\n"+
		"CAIUS LUCIUS\n"+
		"This forwardness\n"+
		"Makes our hopes fair. Command our present numbers\n"+
		"Be muster'd; bid the captains look to't. Now, sir,\n"+
		"What have you dream'd of late of this war's purpose?\n"+
		"Soothsayer\n"+
		"Last night the very gods show'd me a vision--\n"+
		"I fast and pray'd for their intelligence--thus:\n"+
		"I saw Jove's bird, the Roman eagle, wing'd\n"+
		"From the spongy south to this part of the west,\n"+
		"There vanish'd in the sunbeams: which portends--\n"+
		"Unless my sins abuse my divination--\n"+
		"Success to the Roman host.\n"+
		"CAIUS LUCIUS\n"+

		"Without his top? The ruin speaks that sometime\n"+
		"It was a worthy building. How! a page!\n"+
		"Or dead, or sleeping on him? But dead rather;\n"+

		"They crave to be demanded. Who is this\n"+
		"Thou makest thy bloody pillow? Or who was he\n"+
		"That, otherwise than noble nature did,\n"+

		"In this sad wreck? How came it? Who is it?\n"+
		"What art thou?\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"I am nothing: or if not,\n"+
		"Nothing to be were better. This was my master,\n"+
		"A very valiant Briton and a good,\n"+
		"That here by mountaineers lies slain. Alas!\n"+
		"There is no more such masters: I may wander\n"+
		"From east to occident, cry out for service,\n"+

		"Fidele, sir.\n"+
		"CAIUS LUCIUS\n"+
		"Thou dost approve thyself the very same:\n"+
		"Thy name well fits thy faith, thy faith thy name.\n"+
		"Wilt take thy chance with me? I will not say\n"+
		"Thou shalt be so well master'd, but, be sure,\n"+
		"No less beloved. The Roman emperor's letters,\n"+
		"Sent by a consul to me, should not sooner\n"+
		"Than thine own worth prefer thee: go with me.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"I'll follow, sir. But first, an't please the gods,\n"+
		"I'll hide my master from the flies, as deep\n"+
		"As these poor pickaxes can dig; and when\n"+
		"With wild wood-leaves and weeds I ha' strew'd his grave,\n"+
		"And on it said a century of prayers,\n"+
		"Such as I can, twice o'er, I'll weep and sigh;\n"+

		"And make him with our pikes and partisans\n"+
		"A grave: come, arm him. Boy, he is preferr'd\n"+
		"By thee to us, and he shall be interr'd\n"+

		"Enter CYMBELINE, Lords, PISANIO, and Attendants\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"Again; and bring me word how 'tis with her.\n"+
		"Exit an Attendant\n"+
		"A fever with the absence of her son,\n"+
		"A madness, of which her life's in danger. Heavens,\n"+
		"How deeply you at once do touch me! Imogen,\n"+
		"The great part of my comfort, gone; my queen\n"+
		"Upon a desperate bed, and in a time\n"+
		"When fearful wars point at me; her son gone,\n"+
		"So needful for this present: it strikes me, past\n"+
		"The hope of comfort. But for thee, fellow,\n"+
		"Who needs must know of her departure and\n"+
		"Dost seem so ignorant, we'll enforce it from thee\n"+
		"By a sharp torture.\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"Sir, my life is yours;\n"+
		"I humbly set it at your will; but, for my mistress,\n"+
		"I nothing know where she remains, why gone,\n"+
		"Nor when she purposes return. Beseech your highness,\n"+
		"Hold me your loyal servant.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"Good my liege,\n"+
		"The day that she was missing he was here:\n"+
		"I dare be bound he's true and shall perform\n"+
		"All parts of his subjection loyally. For Cloten,\n"+
		"There wants no diligence in seeking him,\n"+
		"And will, no doubt, be found.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"The time is troublesome.\n"+
		"To PISANIO\n"+
		"We'll slip you for a season; but our jealousy\n"+
		"Does yet depend.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"So please your majesty,\n"+
		"The Roman legions, all from Gallia drawn,\n"+
		"Are landed on your coast, with a supply\n"+
		"Of Roman gentlemen, by the senate sent.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"Now for the counsel of my son and queen!\n"+
		"I am amazed with matter.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"Good my liege,\n"+
		"Your preparation can affront no less\n"+
		"Than what you hear of: come more, for more\n"+
		"you're ready:\n"+
		"The want is but to put those powers in motion\n"+
		"That long to move.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"I thank you. Let's withdraw;\n"+
		"And meet the time as it seeks us. We fear not\n"+
		"What can from Italy annoy us; but\n"+
		"We grieve at chances here. Away!\n"+
		"Exeunt all but PISANIO\n"+
		"PISANIO\n"+
		"I heard no letter from my master since\n"+
		"I wrote him Imogen was slain: 'tis strange:\n"+
		"Nor hear I from my mistress who did promise\n"+
		"To yield me often tidings: neither know I\n"+
		"What is betid to Cloten; but remain\n"+
		"Perplex'd in all. The heavens still must work.\n"+
		"Wherein I am false I am honest; not true, to be true.\n"+
		"These present wars shall find I love my country,\n"+
		"Even to the note o' the king, or I'll fall in them.\n"+
		"All other doubts, by time let them be clear'd:\n"+
		"Fortune brings in some boats that are not steer'd.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE IV. Wales: before the cave of Belarius.\n"+
		"Enter BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS.\n"+
		"GUIDERIUS\n"+
		"The noise is round about us.\n"+
		"BELARIUS\n"+
		"Let us from it.\n"+
		"ARVIRAGUS\n"+
		"What pleasure, sir, find we in life, to lock it\n"+
		"From action and adventure?\n"+
		"GUIDERIUS\n"+
		"Nay, what hope\n"+
		"Have we in hiding us? This way, the Romans\n"+
		"Must or for Britons slay us, or receive us\n"+
		"For barbarous and unnatural revolts\n"+
		"During their use, and slay us after.\n"+
		"BELARIUS\n"+
		"Sons,\n"+
		"We'll higher to the mountains; there secure us.\n"+
		"To the king's party there's no going: newness\n"+
		"Of Cloten's death--we being not known, not muster'd\n"+
		"Among the bands--may drive us to a render\n"+
		"Where we have lived, and so extort from's that\n"+
		"Which we have done, whose answer would be death\n"+
		"Drawn on with torture.\n"+
		"GUIDERIUS\n"+
		"This is, sir, a doubt\n"+
		"In such a time nothing becoming you,\n"+
		"Nor satisfying us.\n"+
		"ARVIRAGUS\n"+
		"It is not likely\n"+
		"That when they hear the Roman horses neigh,\n"+
		"Behold their quarter'd fires, have both their eyes\n"+
		"And ears so cloy'd importantly as now,\n"+
		"That they will waste their time upon our note,\n"+
		"To know from whence we are.\n"+
		"BELARIUS\n"+
		"O, I am known\n"+
		"Of many in the army: many years,\n"+
		"Though Cloten then but young, you see, not wore him\n"+
		"From my remembrance. And, besides, the king\n"+
		"Hath not deserved my service nor your loves;\n"+
		"Who find in my exile the want of breeding,\n"+
		"The certainty of this hard life; aye hopeless\n"+
		"To have the courtesy your cradle promised,\n"+
		"But to be still hot summer's tamings and\n"+
		"The shrinking slaves of winter.\n"+
		"GUIDERIUS\n"+
		"Than be so\n"+
		"Better to cease to be. Pray, sir, to the army:\n"+
		"I and my brother are not known; yourself\n"+
		"So out of thought, and thereto so o'ergrown,\n"+
		"Cannot be question'd.\n"+
		"ARVIRAGUS\n"+
		"By this sun that shines,\n"+
		"I'll thither: what thing is it that I never\n"+
		"Did see man die! scarce ever look'd on blood,\n"+
		"But that of coward hares, hot goats, and venison!\n"+
		"Never bestrid a horse, save one that had\n"+
		"A rider like myself, who ne'er wore rowel\n"+
		"Nor iron on his heel! I am ashamed\n"+
		"To look upon the holy sun, to have\n"+
		"The benefit of his blest beams, remaining\n"+
		"So long a poor unknown.\n"+
		"GUIDERIUS\n"+
		"By heavens, I'll go:\n"+
		"If you will bless me, sir, and give me leave,\n"+
		"I'll take the better care, but if you will not,\n"+
		"The hazard therefore due fall on me by\n"+
		"The hands of Romans!\n"+
		"ARVIRAGUS\n"+
		"So say I amen.\n"+
		"BELARIUS\n"+
		"No reason I, since of your lives you set\n"+
		"So slight a valuation, should reserve\n"+
		"My crack'd one to more care. Have with you, boys!\n"+
		"If in your country wars you chance to die,\n"+
		"That is my bed too, lads, an there I'll lie:\n"+
		"Lead, lead.\n"+
		"Aside\n"+
		"The time seems long; their blood\n"+
		"thinks scorn,\n"+
		"Till it fly out and show them princes born.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT V\n"+
		"SCENE I. Britain. The Roman camp.\n"+
		"Enter POSTHUMUS, with a bloody handkerchief\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"Yea, bloody cloth, I'll keep thee, for I wish'd\n"+
		"Thou shouldst be colour'd thus. You married ones,\n"+
		"If each of you should take this course, how many\n"+
		"Must murder wives much better than themselves\n"+
		"For wrying but a little! O Pisanio!\n"+
		"Every good servant does not all commands:\n"+
		"No bond but to do just ones. Gods! if you\n"+
		"Should have ta'en vengeance on my faults, I never\n"+
		"Had lived to put on this: so had you saved\n"+
		"The noble Imogen to repent, and struck\n"+
		"Me, wretch more worth your vengeance. But, alack,\n"+
		"You snatch some hence for little faults; that's love,\n"+
		"To have them fall no more: you some permit\n"+
		"To second ills with ills, each elder worse,\n"+
		"And make them dread it, to the doers' thrift.\n"+
		"But Imogen is your own: do your best wills,\n"+
		"And make me blest to obey! I am brought hither\n"+
		"Among the Italian gentry, and to fight\n"+
		"Against my lady's kingdom: 'tis enough\n"+
		"That, Britain, I have kill'd thy mistress; peace!\n"+
		"I'll give no wound to thee. Therefore, good heavens,\n"+
		"Hear patiently my purpose: I'll disrobe me\n"+
		"Of these Italian weeds and suit myself\n"+
		"As does a Briton peasant: so I'll fight\n"+
		"Against the part I come with; so I'll die\n"+
		"For thee, O Imogen, even for whom my life\n"+
		"Is every breath a death; and thus, unknown,\n"+
		"Pitied nor hated, to the face of peril\n"+
		"Myself I'll dedicate. Let me make men know\n"+
		"More valour in me than my habits show.\n"+
		"Gods, put the strength o' the Leonati in me!\n"+
		"To shame the guise o' the world, I will begin\n"+
		"The fashion, less without and more within.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE II. Field of battle between the British and Roman camps.\n"+
		"Enter, from one side, LUCIUS, IACHIMO, and the Roman Army: from the other side, the British Army; POSTHUMUS LEONATUS following, like a poor soldier. They march over and go out. Then enter again, in skirmish, IACHIMO and POSTHUMUS LEONATUS he vanquisheth and disarmeth IACHIMO, and then leaves him\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"The heaviness and guilt within my bosom\n"+
		"Takes off my manhood: I have belied a lady,\n"+
		"The princess of this country, and the air on't\n"+
		"Revengingly enfeebles me; or could this carl,\n"+
		"A very drudge of nature's, have subdued me\n"+
		"In my profession? Knighthoods and honours, borne\n"+
		"As I wear mine, are titles but of scorn.\n"+
		"If that thy gentry, Britain, go before\n"+
		"This lout as he exceeds our lords, the odds\n"+
		"Is that we scarce are men and you are gods.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"The battle continues; the Britons fly; CYMBELINE is taken: then enter, to his rescue, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS\n"+
		"BELARIUS\n"+
		"Stand, stand! We have the advantage of the ground;\n"+
		"The lane is guarded: nothing routs us but\n"+
		"The villany of our fears.\n"+
		"GUIDERIUS\n"+
		"ARVIRAGUS\n"+
		"Stand, stand, and fight!\n"+
		"Re-enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS, and seconds the Britons: they rescue CYMBELINE, and exeunt. Then re-enter LUCIUS, and IACHIMO, with IMOGEN\n"+
		"CAIUS LUCIUS\n"+
		"Away, boy, from the troops, and save thyself;\n"+
		"For friends kill friends, and the disorder's such\n"+
		"As war were hoodwink'd.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"'Tis their fresh supplies.\n"+
		"CAIUS LUCIUS\n"+
		"It is a day turn'd strangely: or betimes\n"+
		"Let's reinforce, or fly.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. Another part of the field.\n"+
		"Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and a British Lord\n"+
		"Lord\n"+
		"Camest thou from where they made the stand?\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"I did.\n"+
		"Though you, it seems, come from the fliers.\n"+
		"Lord\n"+
		"I did.\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"No blame be to you, sir; for all was lost,\n"+
		"But that the heavens fought: the king himself\n"+
		"Of his wings destitute, the army broken,\n"+
		"And but the backs of Britons seen, all flying\n"+
		"Through a straight lane; the enemy full-hearted,\n"+
		"Lolling the tongue with slaughtering, having work\n"+
		"More plentiful than tools to do't, struck down\n"+
		"Some mortally, some slightly touch'd, some falling\n"+
		"Merely through fear; that the straight pass was damm'd\n"+
		"With dead men hurt behind, and cowards living\n"+
		"To die with lengthen'd shame.\n"+
		"Lord\n"+
		"Where was this lane?\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"Close by the battle, ditch'd, and wall'd with turf;\n"+
		"Which gave advantage to an ancient soldier,\n"+
		"An honest one, I warrant; who deserved\n"+
		"So long a breeding as his white beard came to,\n"+
		"In doing this for's country: athwart the lane,\n"+
		"He, with two striplings-lads more like to run\n"+
		"The country base than to commit such slaughter\n"+
		"With faces fit for masks, or rather fairer\n"+
		"Than those for preservation cased, or shame--\n"+
		"Made good the passage; cried to those that fled,\n"+
		"'Our Britain s harts die flying, not our men:\n"+
		"To darkness fleet souls that fly backwards. Stand;\n"+
		"Or we are Romans and will give you that\n"+
		"Like beasts which you shun beastly, and may save,\n"+
		"But to look back in frown: stand, stand.'\n"+
		"These three,\n"+
		"Three thousand confident, in act as many--\n"+
		"For three performers are the file when all\n"+
		"The rest do nothing--with this word 'Stand, stand,'\n"+
		"Accommodated by the place, more charming\n"+
		"With their own nobleness, which could have turn'd\n"+
		"A distaff to a lance, gilded pale looks,\n"+
		"Part shame, part spirit renew'd; that some,\n"+
		"turn'd coward\n"+
		"But by example--O, a sin in war,\n"+
		"Damn'd in the first beginners!--gan to look\n"+
		"The way that they did, and to grin like lions\n"+
		"Upon the pikes o' the hunters. Then began\n"+
		"A stop i' the chaser, a retire, anon\n"+
		"A rout, confusion thick; forthwith they fly\n"+
		"Chickens, the way which they stoop'd eagles; slaves,\n"+
		"The strides they victors made: and now our cowards,\n"+
		"Like fragments in hard voyages, became\n"+
		"The life o' the need: having found the backdoor open\n"+
		"Of the unguarded hearts, heavens, how they wound!\n"+
		"Some slain before; some dying; some their friends\n"+
		"O'er borne i' the former wave: ten, chased by one,\n"+
		"Are now each one the slaughter-man of twenty:\n"+
		"Those that would die or ere resist are grown\n"+
		"The mortal bugs o' the field.\n"+
		"Lord\n"+
		"This was strange chance\n"+
		"A narrow lane, an old man, and two boys.\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"Nay, do not wonder at it: you are made\n"+
		"Rather to wonder at the things you hear\n"+
		"Than to work any. Will you rhyme upon't,\n"+
		"And vent it for a mockery? Here is one:\n"+
		"'Two boys, an old man twice a boy, a lane,\n"+
		"Preserved the Britons, was the Romans' bane.'\n"+
		"Lord\n"+
		"Nay, be not angry, sir.\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"'Lack, to what end?\n"+
		"Who dares not stand his foe, I'll be his friend;\n"+
		"For if he'll do as he is made to do,\n"+
		"I know he'll quickly fly my friendship too.\n"+
		"You have put me into rhyme.\n"+
		"Lord\n"+
		"Farewell; you're angry.\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"Still going?\n"+
		"Exit Lord\n"+
		"This is a lord! O noble misery,\n"+
		"To be i' the field, and ask 'what news?' of me!\n"+
		"To-day how many would have given their honours\n"+
		"To have saved their carcasses! took heel to do't,\n"+
		"And yet died too! I, in mine own woe charm'd,\n"+
		"Could not find death where I did hear him groan,\n"+
		"Nor feel him where he struck: being an ugly monster,\n"+
		"'Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups, soft beds,\n"+
		"Sweet words; or hath more ministers than we\n"+
		"That draw his knives i' the war. Well, I will find him\n"+
		"For being now a favourer to the Briton,\n"+
		"No more a Briton, I have resumed again\n"+
		"The part I came in: fight I will no more,\n"+
		"But yield me to the veriest hind that shall\n"+
		"Once touch my shoulder. Great the slaughter is\n"+
		"Here made by the Roman; great the answer be\n"+
		"Britons must take. For me, my ransom's death;\n"+
		"On either side I come to spend my breath;\n"+
		"Which neither here I'll keep nor bear again,\n"+
		"But end it by some means for Imogen.\n"+
		"Enter two British Captains and Soldiers\n"+
		"First Captain\n"+
		"Great Jupiter be praised! Lucius is taken.\n"+
		"'Tis thought the old man and his sons were angels.\n"+
		"Second Captain\n"+
		"There was a fourth man, in a silly habit,\n"+
		"That gave the affront with them.\n"+
		"First Captain\n"+
		"So 'tis reported:\n"+
		"But none of 'em can be found. Stand! who's there?\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"A Roman,\n"+
		"Who had not now been drooping here, if seconds\n"+
		"Had answer'd him.\n"+
		"Second Captain\n"+
		"Lay hands on him; a dog!\n"+
		"A leg of Rome shall not return to tell\n"+
		"What crows have peck'd them here. He brags\n"+
		"his service\n"+
		"As if he were of note: bring him to the king.\n"+
		"Enter CYMBELINE, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, ARVIRAGUS, PISANIO, Soldiers, Attendants, and Roman Captives. The Captains present POSTHUMUS LEONATUS to CYMBELINE, who delivers him over to a Gaoler: then exeunt omnes\n"+
		"SCENE IV. A British prison.\n"+
		"Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and two Gaolers\n"+
		"First Gaoler\n"+
		"You shall not now be stol'n, you have locks upon you;\n"+
		"So graze as you find pasture.\n"+
		"Second Gaoler\n"+
		"Ay, or a stomach.\n"+
		"Exeunt Gaolers\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"Most welcome, bondage! for thou art away,\n"+
		"think, to liberty: yet am I better\n"+
		"Than one that's sick o' the gout; since he had rather\n"+
		"Groan so in perpetuity than be cured\n"+
		"By the sure physician, death, who is the key\n"+
		"To unbar these locks. My conscience, thou art fetter'd\n"+
		"More than my shanks and wrists: you good gods, give me\n"+
		"The penitent instrument to pick that bolt,\n"+
		"Then, free for ever! Is't enough I am sorry?\n"+

		"Sir,\n"+
		"In Cambria are we born, and gentlemen:\n"+
		"Further to boast were neither true nor modest,\n"+

		"To sour your happiness, I must report\n"+
		"The queen is dead.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"Who worse than a physician\n"+
		"Would this report become? But I consider,\n"+
		"By medicine life may be prolong'd, yet death\n"+
		"Will seize the doctor too. How ended she?\n"+
		"CORNELIUS\n"+
		"With horror, madly dying, like her life,\n"+
		"Which, being cruel to the world, concluded\n"+
		"Most cruel to herself. What she confess'd\n"+
		"I will report, so please you: these her women\n"+
		"Can trip me, if I err; who with wet cheeks\n"+
		"Were present when she finish'd.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"Prithee, say.\n"+
		"CORNELIUS\n"+
		"First, she confess'd she never loved you, only\n"+
		"Affected greatness got by you, not you:\n"+
		"Married your royalty, was wife to your place;\n"+
		"Abhorr'd your person.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"She alone knew this;\n"+
		"And, but she spoke it dying, I would not\n"+
		"Believe her lips in opening it. Proceed.\n"+
		"CORNELIUS\n"+
		"Your daughter, whom she bore in hand to love\n"+
		"With such integrity, she did confess\n"+
		"Was as a scorpion to her sight; whose life,\n"+
		"But that her flight prevented it, she had\n"+
		"Ta'en off by poison.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"O most delicate fiend!\n"+
		"Who is 't can read a woman? Is there more?\n"+
		"CORNELIUS\n"+
		"More, sir, and worse. She did confess she had\n"+
		"For you a mortal mineral; which, being took,\n"+
		"Should by the minute feed on life and lingering\n"+
		"By inches waste you: in which time she purposed,\n"+
		"By watching, weeping, tendance, kissing, to\n"+
		"O'ercome you with her show, and in time,\n"+
		"When she had fitted you with her craft, to work\n"+
		"Her son into the adoption of the crown:\n"+
		"But, failing of her end by his strange absence,\n"+
		"Grew shameless-desperate; open'd, in despite\n"+
		"Of heaven and men, her purposes; repented\n"+
		"The evils she hatch'd were not effected; so\n"+
		"Despairing died.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"Heard you all this, her women?\n"+
		"First Lady\n"+
		"We did, so please your highness.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"Mine eyes\n"+
		"Were not in fault, for she was beautiful;\n"+
		"Mine ears, that heard her flattery; nor my heart,\n"+
		"That thought her like her seeming; it had\n"+
		"been vicious\n"+
		"To have mistrusted her: yet, O my daughter!\n"+
		"That it was folly in me, thou mayst say,\n"+
		"And prove it in thy feeling. Heaven mend all!\n"+
		"Enter LUCIUS, IACHIMO, the Soothsayer, and other Roman Prisoners, guarded; POSTHUMUS LEONATUS behind, and IMOGEN\n"+
		"Thou comest not, Caius, now for tribute that\n"+
		"The Britons have razed out, though with the loss\n"+
		"Of many a bold one; whose kinsmen have made suit\n"+
		"That their good souls may be appeased with slaughter\n"+
		"Of you their captives, which ourself have granted:\n"+
		"So think of your estate.\n"+
		"CAIUS LUCIUS\n"+
		"Consider, sir, the chance of war: the day\n"+
		"Was yours by accident; had it gone with us,\n"+
		"We should not, when the blood was cool,\n"+
		"have threaten'd\n"+
		"Our prisoners with the sword. But since the gods\n"+
		"Will have it thus, that nothing but our lives\n"+
		"May be call'd ransom, let it come: sufficeth\n"+
		"A Roman with a Roman's heart can suffer:\n"+
		"Augustus lives to think on't: and so much\n"+
		"For my peculiar care. This one thing only\n"+
		"I will entreat; my boy, a Briton born,\n"+
		"Let him be ransom'd: never master had\n"+
		"A page so kind, so duteous, diligent,\n"+
		"So tender over his occasions, true,\n"+
		"So feat, so nurse-like: let his virtue join\n"+
		"With my request, which I make bold your highness\n"+
		"Cannot deny; he hath done no Briton harm,\n"+
		"Though he have served a Roman: save him, sir,\n"+
		"And spare no blood beside.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"I have surely seen him:\n"+
		"His favour is familiar to me. Boy,\n"+
		"Thou hast look'd thyself into my grace,\n"+
		"And art mine own. I know not why, wherefore,\n"+
		"To say 'live, boy:' ne'er thank thy master; live:\n"+
		"And ask of Cymbeline what boon thou wilt,\n"+
		"Fitting my bounty and thy state, I'll give it;\n"+
		"Yea, though thou do demand a prisoner,\n"+
		"The noblest ta'en.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"I humbly thank your highness.\n"+
		"CAIUS LUCIUS\n"+
		"I do not bid thee beg my life, good lad;\n"+
		"And yet I know thou wilt.\n"+

		"No, no: alack,\n"+
		"There's other work in hand: I see a thing\n"+
		"Bitter to me as death: your life, good master,\n"+
		"Must shuffle for itself.\n"+
		"CAIUS LUCIUS\n"+
		"The boy disdains me,\n"+
		"He leaves me, scorns me: briefly die their joys\n"+

		"Why stands he so perplex'd?\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"What wouldst thou, boy?\n"+
		"I love thee more and more: think more and more\n"+
		"What's best to ask. Know'st him thou look'st on? speak,\n"+
		"Wilt have him live? Is he thy kin? thy friend?\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"He is a Roman; no more kin to me\n"+

		"I am glad to be constrain'd to utter that\n"+

		"Upon a time,--unhappy was the clock\n"+
		"That struck the hour!--it was in Rome,--accursed\n"+
		"The mansion where!--'twas at a feast,--O, would\n"+
		"Our viands had been poison'd, or at least\n"+
		"Those which I heaved to head!--the good Posthumus--\n"+
		"What should I say? he was too good to be\n"+
		"Where ill men were; and was the best of all\n"+
		"Amongst the rarest of good ones,--sitting sadly,\n"+
		"Hearing us praise our loves of Italy\n"+
		"For beauty that made barren the swell'd boast\n"+
		"Of him that best could speak, for feature, laming\n"+
		"The shrine of Venus, or straight-pight Minerva.\n"+
		"Postures beyond brief nature, for condition,\n"+
		"A shop of all the qualities that man\n"+

		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"I stand on fire:\n"+
		"Come to the matter.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"All too soon I shall,\n"+
		"Unless thou wouldst grieve quickly. This Posthumus,\n"+
		"Most like a noble lord in love and one\n"+
		"That had a royal lover, took his hint;\n"+
		"And, not dispraising whom we praised,--therein\n"+
		"He was as calm as virtue--he began\n"+
		"His mistress' picture; which by his tongue\n"+

		"Which I gave him for cordial, she is served\n"+
		"As I would serve a rat.'\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"What's this, Comelius?\n"+
		"CORNELIUS\n"+
		"The queen, sir, very oft importuned me\n"+
		"To temper poisons for her, still pretending\n"+
		"The satisfaction of her knowledge only\n"+
		"In killing creatures vile, as cats and dogs,\n"+
		"Of no esteem: I, dreading that her purpose\n"+
		"Was of more danger, did compound for her\n"+
		"A certain stuff, which, being ta'en, would cease\n"+
		"The present power of life, but in short time\n"+
		"All offices of nature should again\n"+
		"Do their due functions. Have you ta'en of it?\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"Most like I did, for I was dead.\n"+
		"BELARIUS\n"+
		"My boys,\n"+
		"There was our error.\n"+
		"GUIDERIUS\n"+
		"This is, sure, Fidele.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"Why did you throw your wedded lady from you?\n"+

		"PISANIO\n"+
		"My lord,\n"+
		"Now fear is from me, I'll speak troth. Lord Cloten,\n"+
		"Upon my lady's missing, came to me\n"+
		"With his sword drawn; foam'd at the mouth, and swore,\n"+
		"If I discover'd not which way she was gone,\n"+
		"It was my instant death. By accident,\n"+
		"had a feigned letter of my master's\n"+
		"Then in my pocket; which directed him\n"+
		"To seek her on the mountains near to Milford;\n"+
		"Where, in a frenzy, in my master's garments,\n"+
		"Which he enforced from me, away he posts\n"+
		"With unchaste purpose and with oath to violate\n"+
		"My lady's honour: what became of him\n"+
		"I further know not.\n"+

		"Let me end the story:\n"+
		"I slew him there.\n"+

		"Marry, the gods forfend!\n"+
		"I would not thy good deeds should from my lips\n"+
		"Pluck a bard sentence: prithee, valiant youth,\n"+
		"Deny't again.\n"+
		"GUIDERIUS\n"+
		"I have spoke it, and I did it.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"He was a prince.\n"+
		"GUIDERIUS\n"+
		"A most incivil one: the wrongs he did me\n"+
		"Were nothing prince-like; for he did provoke me\n"+
		"With language that would make me spurn the sea,\n"+
		"If it could so roar to me: I cut off's head;\n"+
		"And am right glad he is not standing here\n"+
		"To tell this tale of mine.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"I am sorry for thee:\n"+
		"By thine own tongue thou art condemn'd, and must\n"+
		"Endure our law: thou'rt dead.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"That headless man\n"+
		"I thought had been my lord.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"Bind the offender,\n"+
		"And take him from our presence.\n"+
		"BELARIUS\n"+
		"Stay, sir king:\n"+
		"This man is better than the man he slew,\n"+
		"As well descended as thyself; and hath\n"+
		"More of thee merited than a band of Clotens\n"+
		"Had ever scar for.\n"+
		"To the Guard\n"+
		"Let his arms alone;\n"+
		"They were not born for bondage.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"Why, old soldier,\n"+
		"Wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for,\n"+
		"By tasting of our wrath? How of descent\n"+
		"As good as we?\n"+
		"ARVIRAGUS\n"+
		"In that he spake too far.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"And thou shalt die for't.\n"+
		"BELARIUS\n"+
		"We will die all three:\n"+
		"But I will prove that two on's are as good\n"+
		"As I have given out him. My sons, I must,\n"+
		"For mine own part, unfold a dangerous speech,\n"+
		"Though, haply, well for you.\n"+
		"ARVIRAGUS\n"+
		"Your danger's ours.\n"+
		"GUIDERIUS\n"+
		"And our good his.\n"+
		"BELARIUS\n"+
		"Have at it then, by leave.\n"+
		"Thou hadst, great king, a subject who\n"+
		"Was call'd Belarius.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"What of him? he is\n"+
		"A banish'd traitor.\n"+
		"BELARIUS\n"+
		"He it is that hath\n"+
		"Assumed this age; indeed a banish'd man;\n"+
		"I know not how a traitor.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"Take him hence:\n"+
		"The whole world shall not save him.\n"+
		"BELARIUS\n"+
		"Not too hot:\n"+
		"First pay me for the nursing of thy sons;\n"+
		"And let it be confiscate all, so soon\n"+
		"As I have received it.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"Nursing of my sons!\n"+
		"BELARIUS\n"+
		"I am too blunt and saucy: here's my knee:\n"+
		"Ere I arise, I will prefer my sons;\n"+
		"Then spare not the old father. Mighty sir,\n"+
		"These two young gentlemen, that call me father\n"+
		"And think they are my sons, are none of mine;\n"+
		"They are the issue of your loins, my liege,\n"+
		"And blood of your begetting.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"How! my issue!\n"+
		"BELARIUS\n"+
		"So sure as you your father's. I, old Morgan,\n"+
		"Am that Belarius whom you sometime banish'd:\n"+
		"Your pleasure was my mere offence, my punishment\n"+
		"Itself, and all my treason; that I suffer'd\n"+
		"Was all the harm I did. These gentle princes--\n"+
		"For such and so they are--these twenty years\n"+
		"Have I train'd up: those arts they have as I\n"+
		"Could put into them; my breeding was, sir, as\n"+
		"Your highness knows. Their nurse, Euriphile,\n"+
		"Whom for the theft I wedded, stole these children\n"+
		"Upon my banishment: I moved her to't,\n"+
		"Having received the punishment before,\n"+
		"For that which I did then: beaten for loyalty\n"+
		"Excited me to treason: their dear loss,\n"+
		"The more of you 'twas felt, the more it shaped\n"+
		"Unto my end of stealing them. But, gracious sir,\n"+
		"Here are your sons again; and I must lose\n"+
		"Two of the sweet'st companions in the world.\n"+
		"The benediction of these covering heavens\n"+
		"Fall on their heads like dew! for they are worthy\n"+
		"To inlay heaven with stars.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"Thou weep'st, and speak'st.\n"+
		"The service that you three have done is more\n"+
		"Unlike than this thou tell'st. I lost my children:\n"+
		"If these be they, I know not how to wish\n"+
		"A pair of worthier sons.\n"+
		"BELARIUS\n"+
		"Be pleased awhile.\n"+
		"This gentleman, whom I call Polydore,\n"+
		"Most worthy prince, as yours, is true Guiderius:\n"+
		"This gentleman, my Cadwal, Arviragus,\n"+
		"Your younger princely son; he, sir, was lapp'd\n"+
		"In a most curious mantle, wrought by the hand\n"+
		"Of his queen mother, which for more probation\n"+
		"I can with ease produce.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"Guiderius had\n"+
		"Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;\n"+
		"It was a mark of wonder.\n"+
		"BELARIUS\n"+
		"This is he;\n"+
		"Who hath upon him still that natural stamp:\n"+
		"It was wise nature's end in the donation,\n"+
		"To be his evidence now.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"O, what, am I\n"+
		"A mother to the birth of three? Ne'er mother\n"+
		"Rejoiced deliverance more. Blest pray you be,\n"+
		"That, after this strange starting from your orbs,\n"+
		"may reign in them now! O Imogen,\n"+
		"Thou hast lost by this a kingdom.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"No, my lord;\n"+
		"I have got two worlds by 't. O my gentle brothers,\n"+
		"Have we thus met? O, never say hereafter\n"+
		"But I am truest speaker you call'd me brother,\n"+
		"When I was but your sister; I you brothers,\n"+
		"When ye were so indeed.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"Did you e'er meet?\n"+
		"ARVIRAGUS\n"+
		"Ay, my good lord.\n"+
		"GUIDERIUS\n"+
		"And at first meeting loved;\n"+
		"Continued so, until we thought he died.\n"+
		"CORNELIUS\n"+
		"By the queen's dram she swallow'd.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"O rare instinct!\n"+
		"When shall I hear all through? This fierce\n"+
		"abridgement\n"+
		"Hath to it circumstantial branches, which\n"+
		"Distinction should be rich in. Where? how lived You?\n"+
		"And when came you to serve our Roman captive?\n"+
		"How parted with your brothers? how first met them?\n"+
		"Why fled you from the court? and whither? These,\n"+
		"And your three motives to the battle, with\n"+
		"I know not how much more, should be demanded;\n"+
		"And all the other by-dependencies,\n"+
		"From chance to chance: but nor the time nor place\n"+
		"Will serve our long inter'gatories. See,\n"+
		"Posthumus anchors upon Imogen,\n"+
		"And she, like harmless lightning, throws her eye\n"+
		"On him, her brother, me, her master, hitting\n"+
		"Each object with a joy: the counterchange\n"+
		"Is severally in all. Let's quit this ground,\n"+
		"And smoke the temple with our sacrifices.\n"+
		"To BELARIUS\n"+
		"Thou art my brother; so we'll hold thee ever.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"You are my father too, and did relieve me,\n"+
		"To see this gracious season.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"All o'erjoy'd,\n"+
		"Save these in bonds: let them be joyful too,\n"+
		"For they shall taste our comfort.\n"+
		"IMOGEN\n"+
		"My good master,\n"+
		"I will yet do you service.\n"+
		"CAIUS LUCIUS\n"+
		"Happy be you!\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"The forlorn soldier, that so nobly fought,\n"+
		"He would have well becomed this place, and graced\n"+
		"The thankings of a king.\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"I am, sir,\n"+
		"The soldier that did company these three\n"+
		"In poor beseeming; 'twas a fitment for\n"+
		"The purpose I then follow'd. That I was he,\n"+
		"Speak, Iachimo: I had you down and might\n"+
		"Have made you finish.\n"+
		"IACHIMO\n"+
		"[Kneeling] I am down again:\n"+
		"But now my heavy conscience sinks my knee,\n"+
		"As then your force did. Take that life, beseech you,\n"+
		"Which I so often owe: but your ring first;\n"+
		"And here the bracelet of the truest princess\n"+
		"That ever swore her faith.\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"Kneel not to me:\n"+
		"The power that I have on you is, to spare you;\n"+
		"The malice towards you to forgive you: live,\n"+
		"And deal with others better.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"Nobly doom'd!\n"+
		"We'll learn our freeness of a son-in-law;\n"+
		"Pardon's the word to all.\n"+
		"ARVIRAGUS\n"+
		"You holp us, sir,\n"+
		"As you did mean indeed to be our brother;\n"+
		"Joy'd are we that you are.\n"+
		"POSTHUMUS LEONATUS\n"+
		"Your servant, princes. Good my lord of Rome,\n"+
		"Call forth your soothsayer: as I slept, methought\n"+
		"Great Jupiter, upon his eagle back'd,\n"+
		"Appear'd to me, with other spritely shows\n"+
		"Of mine own kindred: when I waked, I found\n"+
		"This label on my bosom; whose containing\n"+
		"Is so from sense in hardness, that I can\n"+
		"Make no collection of it: let him show\n"+
		"His skill in the construction.\n"+
		"CAIUS LUCIUS\n"+
		"Philarmonus!\n"+
		"Soothsayer\n"+
		"Here, my good lord.\n"+
		"CAIUS LUCIUS\n"+
		"Read, and declare the meaning.\n"+
		"Soothsayer\n"+
		"[Reads] 'When as a lion's whelp shall, to himself\n"+
		"unknown, without seeking find, and be embraced by a\n"+
		"piece of tender air; and when from a stately cedar\n"+
		"shall be lopped branches, which, being dead many\n"+
		"years, shall after revive, be jointed to the old\n"+
		"stock, and freshly grow; then shall Posthumus end\n"+
		"his miseries, Britain be fortunate and flourish in\n"+
		"peace and plenty.'\n"+
		"Thou, Leonatus, art the lion's whelp;\n"+
		"The fit and apt construction of thy name,\n"+
		"Being Leonatus, doth import so much.\n"+
		"To CYMBELINE\n"+
		"The piece of tender air, thy virtuous daughter,\n"+
		"Which we call 'mollis aer;' and 'mollis aer'\n"+
		"We term it 'mulier:' which 'mulier' I divine\n"+
		"Is this most constant wife; who, even now,\n"+
		"Answering the letter of the oracle,\n"+
		"Unknown to you, unsought, were clipp'd about\n"+
		"With this most tender air.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"This hath some seeming.\n"+
		"Soothsayer\n"+
		"The lofty cedar, royal Cymbeline,\n"+
		"Personates thee: and thy lopp'd branches point\n"+
		"Thy two sons forth; who, by Belarius stol'n,\n"+
		"For many years thought dead, are now revived,\n"+
		"To the majestic cedar join'd, whose issue\n"+
		"Promises Britain peace and plenty.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"Well\n"+
		"My peace we will begin. And, Caius Lucius,\n"+
		"Although the victor, we submit to Caesar,\n"+
		"And to the Roman empire; promising\n"+
		"To pay our wonted tribute, from the which\n"+
		"We were dissuaded by our wicked queen;\n"+
		"Whom heavens, in justice, both on her and hers,\n"+
		"Have laid most heavy hand.\n"+
		"Soothsayer\n"+
		"The fingers of the powers above do tune\n"+
		"The harmony of this peace. The vision\n"+
		"Which I made known to Lucius, ere the stroke\n"+
		"Of this yet scarce-cold battle, at this instant\n"+
		"Is full accomplish'd; for the Roman eagle,\n"+
		"From south to west on wing soaring aloft,\n"+
		"Lessen'd herself, and in the beams o' the sun\n"+
		"So vanish'd: which foreshow'd our princely eagle,\n"+
		"The imperial Caesar, should again unite\n"+
		"His favour with the radiant Cymbeline,\n"+
		"Which shines here in the west.\n"+
		"CYMBELINE\n"+
		"Laud we the gods;\n"+
		"And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils\n"+
		"From our blest altars. Publish we this peace\n"+
		"To all our subjects. Set we forward: let\n"+
		"A Roman and a British ensign wave\n"+
		"Friendly together: so through Lud's-town march:\n"+
		"And in the temple of great Jupiter\n"+
		"Our peace we'll ratify; seal it with feasts.\n"+
