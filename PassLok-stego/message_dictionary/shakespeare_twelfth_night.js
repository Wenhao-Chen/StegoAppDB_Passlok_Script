		"Twelfth Night\n"+
		"ACT I\n"+
		"SCENE I. DUKE ORSINO's palace.\n"+
		"Enter DUKE ORSINO, CURIO, and other Lords; Musicians attending\n"+
		"DUKE ORSINO\n"+
		"If music be the food of love, play on;\n"+
		"Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting,\n"+
		"The appetite may sicken, and so die.\n"+
		"That strain again! it had a dying fall:\n"+
		"O, it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound,\n"+
		"That breathes upon a bank of violets,\n"+
		"Stealing and giving odour! Enough; no more:\n"+
		"'Tis not so sweet now as it was before.\n"+
		"O spirit of love! how quick and fresh art thou,\n"+
		"That, notwithstanding thy capacity\n"+
		"Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,\n"+
		"Of what validity and pitch soe'er,\n"+
		"But falls into abatement and low price,\n"+
		"Even in a minute: so full of shapes is fancy\n"+
		"That it alone is high fantastical.\n"+
		"CURIO\n"+
		"Will you go hunt, my lord?\n"+
		"DUKE ORSINO\n"+
		"What, Curio?\n"+
		"CURIO\n"+
		"The hart.\n"+
		"DUKE ORSINO\n"+
		"Why, so I do, the noblest that I have:\n"+
		"O, when mine eyes did see Olivia first,\n"+
		"Methought she purged the air of pestilence!\n"+
		"That instant was I turn'd into a hart;\n"+
		"And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,\n"+
		"E'er since pursue me.\n"+
		"Enter VALENTINE\n"+
		"How now! what news from her?\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"So please my lord, I might not be admitted;\n"+
		"But from her handmaid do return this answer:\n"+
		"The element itself, till seven years' heat,\n"+
		"Shall not behold her face at ample view;\n"+
		"But, like a cloistress, she will veiled walk\n"+
		"And water once a day her chamber round\n"+
		"With eye-offending brine: all this to season\n"+
		"A brother's dead love, which she would keep fresh\n"+
		"And lasting in her sad remembrance.\n"+
		"DUKE ORSINO\n"+
		"O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame\n"+
		"To pay this debt of love but to a brother,\n"+
		"How will she love, when the rich golden shaft\n"+
		"Hath kill'd the flock of all affections else\n"+
		"That live in her; when liver, brain and heart,\n"+
		"These sovereign thrones, are all supplied, and fill'd\n"+
		"Her sweet perfections with one self king!\n"+
		"Away before me to sweet beds of flowers:\n"+
		"Love-thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. The sea-coast.\n"+
		"Enter VIOLA, a Captain, and Sailors\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"What country, friends, is this?\n"+
		"Captain\n"+
		"This is Illyria, lady.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"And what should I do in Illyria?\n"+
		"My brother he is in Elysium.\n"+
		"Perchance he is not drown'd: what think you, sailors?\n"+
		"Captain\n"+
		"It is perchance that you yourself were saved.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"O my poor brother! and so perchance may he be.\n"+
		"Captain\n"+
		"True, madam: and, to comfort you with chance,\n"+
		"Assure yourself, after our ship did split,\n"+
		"When you and those poor number saved with you\n"+
		"Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,\n"+
		"Most provident in peril, bind himself,\n"+
		"Courage and hope both teaching him the practise,\n"+
		"To a strong mast that lived upon the sea;\n"+
		"Where, like Arion on the dolphin's back,\n"+
		"I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves\n"+
		"So long as I could see.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"For saying so, there's gold:\n"+
		"Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,\n"+
		"Whereto thy speech serves for authority,\n"+
		"The like of him. Know'st thou this country?\n"+
		"Captain\n"+
		"Ay, madam, well; for I was bred and born\n"+
		"Not three hours' travel from this very place.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"Who governs here?\n"+
		"Captain\n"+
		"A noble duke, in nature as in name.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"What is the name?\n"+
		"Captain\n"+
		"Orsino.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"Orsino! I have heard my father name him:\n"+
		"He was a bachelor then.\n"+
		"Captain\n"+
		"And so is now, or was so very late;\n"+
		"For but a month ago I went from hence,\n"+
		"And then 'twas fresh in murmur,--as, you know,\n"+
		"What great ones do the less will prattle of,--\n"+
		"That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"What's she?\n"+
		"Captain\n"+
		"A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count\n"+
		"That died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her\n"+
		"In the protection of his son, her brother,\n"+
		"Who shortly also died: for whose dear love,\n"+
		"They say, she hath abjured the company\n"+
		"And sight of men.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"O that I served that lady\n"+
		"And might not be delivered to the world,\n"+
		"Till I had made mine own occasion mellow,\n"+
		"What my estate is!\n"+
		"Captain\n"+
		"That were hard to compass;\n"+
		"Because she will admit no kind of suit,\n"+
		"No, not the duke's.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"There is a fair behavior in thee, captain;\n"+
		"And though that nature with a beauteous wall\n"+
		"Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee\n"+
		"I will believe thou hast a mind that suits\n"+
		"With this thy fair and outward character.\n"+
		"I prithee, and I'll pay thee bounteously,\n"+
		"Conceal me what I am, and be my aid\n"+
		"For such disguise as haply shall become\n"+
		"The form of my intent. I'll serve this duke:\n"+
		"Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him:\n"+
		"It may be worth thy pains; for I can sing\n"+
		"And speak to him in many sorts of music\n"+
		"That will allow me very worth his service.\n"+
		"What else may hap to time I will commit;\n"+
		"Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.\n"+
		"Captain\n"+
		"Be you his eunuch, and your mute I'll be:\n"+
		"When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"I thank thee: lead me on.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. OLIVIA'S house.\n"+
		"Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and MARIA\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"What a plague means my niece, to take the death of\n"+
		"her brother thus? I am sure care's an enemy to life.\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o'\n"+
		"nights: your cousin, my lady, takes great\n"+
		"exceptions to your ill hours.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Why, let her except, before excepted.\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest\n"+
		"limits of order.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Confine! I'll confine myself no finer than I am:\n"+
		"these clothes are good enough to drink in; and so be\n"+
		"these boots too: an they be not, let them hang\n"+
		"themselves in their own straps.\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"That quaffing and drinking will undo you: I heard\n"+
		"my lady talk of it yesterday; and of a foolish\n"+
		"knight that you brought in one night here to be her wooer.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Who, Sir Andrew Aguecheek?\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"Ay, he.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"He's as tall a man as any's in Illyria.\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"What's that to the purpose?\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Why, he has three thousand ducats a year.\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"Ay, but he'll have but a year in all these ducats:\n"+
		"he's a very fool and a prodigal.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Fie, that you'll say so! he plays o' the\n"+
		"viol-de-gamboys, and speaks three or four languages\n"+
		"word for word without book, and hath all the good\n"+
		"gifts of nature.\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"He hath indeed, almost natural: for besides that\n"+
		"he's a fool, he's a great quarreller: and but that\n"+
		"he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he\n"+
		"hath in quarrelling, 'tis thought among the prudent\n"+
		"he would quickly have the gift of a grave.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"By this hand, they are scoundrels and subtractors\n"+
		"that say so of him. Who are they?\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"They that add, moreover, he's drunk nightly in your company.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"With drinking healths to my niece: I'll drink to\n"+
		"her as long as there is a passage in my throat and\n"+
		"drink in Illyria: he's a coward and a coystrill\n"+
		"that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn\n"+
		"o' the toe like a parish-top. What, wench!\n"+
		"Castiliano vulgo! for here comes Sir Andrew Agueface.\n"+
		"Enter SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"Sir Toby Belch! how now, Sir Toby Belch!\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Sweet Sir Andrew!\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"Bless you, fair shrew.\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"And you too, sir.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Accost, Sir Andrew, accost.\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"What's that?\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"My niece's chambermaid.\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance.\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"My name is Mary, sir.\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"Good Mistress Mary Accost,--\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"You mistake, knight; 'accost' is front her, board\n"+
		"her, woo her, assail her.\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"By my troth, I would not undertake her in this\n"+
		"company. Is that the meaning of 'accost'?\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"Fare you well, gentlemen.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"An thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst\n"+
		"never draw sword again.\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"An you part so, mistress, I would I might never\n"+
		"draw sword again. Fair lady, do you think you have\n"+
		"fools in hand?\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"Sir, I have not you by the hand.\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"Marry, but you shall have; and here's my hand.\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"Now, sir, 'thought is free:' I pray you, bring\n"+
		"your hand to the buttery-bar and let it drink.\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"Wherefore, sweet-heart? what's your metaphor?\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"It's dry, sir.\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"Why, I think so: I am not such an ass but I can\n"+
		"keep my hand dry. But what's your jest?\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"A dry jest, sir.\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"Are you full of them?\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"Ay, sir, I have them at my fingers' ends: marry,\n"+
		"now I let go your hand, I am barren.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"O knight thou lackest a cup of canary: when did I\n"+
		"see thee so put down?\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"Never in your life, I think; unless you see canary\n"+
		"put me down. Methinks sometimes I have no more wit\n"+
		"than a Christian or an ordinary man has: but I am a\n"+
		"great eater of beef and I believe that does harm to my wit.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"No question.\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"An I thought that, I'ld forswear it. I'll ride home\n"+
		"to-morrow, Sir Toby.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Pourquoi, my dear knight?\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"What is 'Pourquoi'? do or not do? I would I had\n"+
		"bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in\n"+
		"fencing, dancing and bear-baiting: O, had I but\n"+
		"followed the arts!\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"Why, would that have mended my hair?\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Past question; for thou seest it will not curl by nature.\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"But it becomes me well enough, does't not?\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Excellent; it hangs like flax on a distaff; and I\n"+
		"hope to see a housewife take thee between her legs\n"+
		"and spin it off.\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"Faith, I'll home to-morrow, Sir Toby: your niece\n"+
		"will not be seen; or if she be, it's four to one\n"+
		"she'll none of me: the count himself here hard by woos her.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"She'll none o' the count: she'll not match above\n"+
		"her degree, neither in estate, years, nor wit; I\n"+
		"have heard her swear't. Tut, there's life in't,\n"+
		"man.\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"I'll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o' the\n"+
		"strangest mind i' the world; I delight in masques\n"+
		"and revels sometimes altogether.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Art thou good at these kickshawses, knight?\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under the\n"+
		"degree of my betters; and yet I will not compare\n"+
		"with an old man.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"Faith, I can cut a caper.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"And I can cut the mutton to't.\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong\n"+
		"as any man in Illyria.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Wherefore are these things hid? wherefore have\n"+
		"these gifts a curtain before 'em? are they like to\n"+
		"take dust, like Mistress Mall's picture? why dost\n"+
		"thou not go to church in a galliard and come home in\n"+
		"a coranto? My very walk should be a jig; I would not\n"+
		"so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace. What\n"+
		"dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues in?\n"+
		"I did think, by the excellent constitution of thy\n"+
		"leg, it was formed under the star of a galliard.\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"Ay, 'tis strong, and it does indifferent well in a\n"+
		"flame-coloured stock. Shall we set about some revels?\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"What shall we do else? were we not born under Taurus?\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"Taurus! That's sides and heart.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"No, sir; it is legs and thighs. Let me see the\n"+
		"caper; ha! higher: ha, ha! excellent!\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV. DUKE ORSINO's palace.\n"+
		"Enter VALENTINE and VIOLA in man's attire\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"If the duke continue these favours towards you,\n"+
		"Cesario, you are like to be much advanced: he hath\n"+
		"known you but three days, and already you are no stranger.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"You either fear his humour or my negligence, that\n"+
		"you call in question the continuance of his love:\n"+
		"is he inconstant, sir, in his favours?\n"+
		"VALENTINE\n"+
		"No, believe me.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"I thank you. Here comes the count.\n"+
		"Enter DUKE ORSINO, CURIO, and Attendants\n"+
		"DUKE ORSINO\n"+
		"Who saw Cesario, ho?\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"On your attendance, my lord; here.\n"+
		"DUKE ORSINO\n"+
		"Stand you a while aloof, Cesario,\n"+
		"Thou know'st no less but all; I have unclasp'd\n"+
		"To thee the book even of my secret soul:\n"+
		"Therefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her;\n"+
		"Be not denied access, stand at her doors,\n"+
		"And tell them, there thy fixed foot shall grow\n"+
		"Till thou have audience.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"Sure, my noble lord,\n"+
		"If she be so abandon'd to her sorrow\n"+
		"As it is spoke, she never will admit me.\n"+
		"DUKE ORSINO\n"+
		"Be clamorous and leap all civil bounds\n"+
		"Rather than make unprofited return.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"Say I do speak with her, my lord, what then?\n"+
		"DUKE ORSINO\n"+
		"O, then unfold the passion of my love,\n"+
		"Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith:\n"+
		"It shall become thee well to act my woes;\n"+
		"She will attend it better in thy youth\n"+
		"Than in a nuncio's of more grave aspect.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"I think not so, my lord.\n"+
		"DUKE ORSINO\n"+
		"Dear lad, believe it;\n"+
		"For they shall yet belie thy happy years,\n"+
		"That say thou art a man: Diana's lip\n"+
		"Is not more smooth and rubious; thy small pipe\n"+
		"Is as the maiden's organ, shrill and sound,\n"+
		"And all is semblative a woman's part.\n"+
		"I know thy constellation is right apt\n"+
		"For this affair. Some four or five attend him;\n"+
		"All, if you will; for I myself am best\n"+
		"When least in company. Prosper well in this,\n"+
		"And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord,\n"+
		"To call his fortunes thine.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"I'll do my best\n"+
		"To woo your lady:\n"+
		"Aside\n"+
		"yet, a barful strife!\n"+
		"Whoe'er I woo, myself would be his wife.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE V. OLIVIA'S house.\n"+
		"Enter MARIA and Clown\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"Nay, either tell me where thou hast been, or I will\n"+
		"not open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter in\n"+
		"way of thy excuse: my lady will hang thee for thy absence.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Let her hang me: he that is well hanged in this\n"+
		"world needs to fear no colours.\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"Make that good.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"He shall see none to fear.\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"A good lenten answer: I can tell thee where that\n"+
		"saying was born, of 'I fear no colours.'\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Where, good Mistress Mary?\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"In the wars; and that may you be bold to say in your foolery.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Well, God give them wisdom that have it; and those\n"+
		"that are fools, let them use their talents.\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent; or,\n"+
		"to be turned away, is not that as good as a hanging to you?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage; and,\n"+
		"for turning away, let summer bear it out.\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"You are resolute, then?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Not so, neither; but I am resolved on two points.\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"That if one break, the other will hold; or, if both\n"+
		"break, your gaskins fall.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Apt, in good faith; very apt. Well, go thy way; if\n"+
		"Sir Toby would leave drinking, thou wert as witty a\n"+
		"piece of Eve's flesh as any in Illyria.\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"Peace, you rogue, no more o' that. Here comes my\n"+
		"lady: make your excuse wisely, you were best.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Wit, an't be thy will, put me into good fooling!\n"+
		"Those wits, that think they have thee, do very oft\n"+
		"prove fools; and I, that am sure I lack thee, may\n"+
		"pass for a wise man: for what says Quinapalus?\n"+
		"'Better a witty fool, than a foolish wit.'\n"+
		"Enter OLIVIA with MALVOLIO\n"+
		"God bless thee, lady!\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Take the fool away.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Do you not hear, fellows? Take away the lady.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Go to, you're a dry fool; I'll no more of you:\n"+
		"besides, you grow dishonest.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Two faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel\n"+
		"will amend: for give the dry fool drink, then is\n"+
		"the fool not dry: bid the dishonest man mend\n"+
		"himself; if he mend, he is no longer dishonest; if\n"+
		"he cannot, let the botcher mend him. Any thing\n"+
		"that's mended is but patched: virtue that\n"+
		"transgresses is but patched with sin; and sin that\n"+
		"amends is but patched with virtue. If that this\n"+
		"simple syllogism will serve, so; if it will not,\n"+
		"what remedy? As there is no true cuckold but\n"+
		"calamity, so beauty's a flower. The lady bade take\n"+
		"away the fool; therefore, I say again, take her away.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Sir, I bade them take away you.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Misprision in the highest degree! Lady, cucullus non\n"+
		"facit monachum; that's as much to say as I wear not\n"+
		"motley in my brain. Good madonna, give me leave to\n"+
		"prove you a fool.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Can you do it?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Dexterously, good madonna.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Make your proof.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"I must catechise you for it, madonna: good my mouse\n"+
		"of virtue, answer me.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Well, sir, for want of other idleness, I'll bide your proof.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Good madonna, why mournest thou?\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Good fool, for my brother's death.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"I think his soul is in hell, madonna.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"I know his soul is in heaven, fool.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"The more fool, madonna, to mourn for your brother's\n"+
		"soul being in heaven. Take away the fool, gentlemen.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"What think you of this fool, Malvolio? doth he not mend?\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"Yes, and shall do till the pangs of death shake him:\n"+
		"infirmity, that decays the wise, doth ever make the\n"+
		"better fool.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the\n"+
		"better increasing your folly! Sir Toby will be\n"+
		"sworn that I am no fox; but he will not pass his\n"+
		"word for two pence that you are no fool.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"How say you to that, Malvolio?\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a\n"+
		"barren rascal: I saw him put down the other day\n"+
		"with an ordinary fool that has no more brain\n"+
		"than a stone. Look you now, he's out of his guard\n"+
		"already; unless you laugh and minister occasion to\n"+
		"him, he is gagged. I protest, I take these wise men,\n"+
		"that crow so at these set kind of fools, no better\n"+
		"than the fools' zanies.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Oh, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste\n"+
		"with a distempered appetite. To be generous,\n"+
		"guiltless and of free disposition, is to take those\n"+
		"things for bird-bolts that you deem cannon-bullets:\n"+
		"there is no slander in an allowed fool, though he do\n"+
		"nothing but rail; nor no railing in a known discreet\n"+
		"man, though he do nothing but reprove.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Now Mercury endue thee with leasing, for thou\n"+
		"speakest well of fools!\n"+
		"Re-enter MARIA\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"Madam, there is at the gate a young gentleman much\n"+
		"desires to speak with you.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"From the Count Orsino, is it?\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"I know not, madam: 'tis a fair young man, and well attended.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Who of my people hold him in delay?\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"Sir Toby, madam, your kinsman.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Fetch him off, I pray you; he speaks nothing but\n"+
		"madman: fie on him!\n"+

		"Now you see, sir, how your fooling grows old, and\n"+
		"people dislike it.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Thou hast spoke for us, madonna, as if thy eldest\n"+

		"Enter SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"By mine honour, half drunk. What is he at the gate, cousin?\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"A gentleman.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"A gentleman! what gentleman?\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"'Tis a gentle man here--a plague o' these\n"+
		"pickle-herring! How now, sot!\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Good Sir Toby!\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Cousin, cousin, how have you come so early by this lethargy?\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Lechery! I defy lechery. There's one at the gate.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Ay, marry, what is he?\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Let him be the devil, an he will, I care not: give\n"+
		"me faith, say I. Well, it's all one.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"What's a drunken man like, fool?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Like a drowned man, a fool and a mad man: one\n"+
		"draught above heat makes him a fool; the second mads\n"+
		"him; and a third drowns him.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Go thou and seek the crowner, and let him sit o' my\n"+
		"coz; for he's in the third degree of drink, he's\n"+
		"drowned: go, look after him.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+

		"to the madman.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"Re-enter MALVOLIO\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"Madam, yond young fellow swears he will speak with\n"+
		"you. I told him you were sick; he takes on him to\n"+
		"understand so much, and therefore comes to speak\n"+
		"with you. I told him you were asleep; he seems to\n"+
		"have a foreknowledge of that too, and therefore\n"+
		"comes to speak with you. What is to be said to him,\n"+
		"lady? he's fortified against any denial.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Tell him he shall not speak with me.\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"Has been told so; and he says, he'll stand at your\n"+
		"door like a sheriff's post, and be the supporter to\n"+
		"a bench, but he'll speak with you.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"What kind o' man is he?\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"Why, of mankind.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"What manner of man?\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"Of very ill manner; he'll speak with you, will you or no.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Of what personage and years is he?\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"Not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for\n"+
		"a boy; as a squash is before 'tis a peascod, or a\n"+
		"cooling when 'tis almost an apple: 'tis with him\n"+
		"in standing water, between boy and man. He is very\n"+
		"well-favoured and he speaks very shrewishly; one\n"+
		"would think his mother's milk were scarce out of him.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Let him approach: call in my gentlewoman.\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"Gentlewoman, my lady calls.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+

		"Enter VIOLA, and Attendants\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"The honourable lady of the house, which is she?\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Speak to me; I shall answer for her.\n"+
		"Your will?\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"Most radiant, exquisite and unmatchable beauty,--I\n"+
		"pray you, tell me if this be the lady of the house,\n"+
		"for I never saw her: I would be loath to cast away\n"+
		"my speech, for besides that it is excellently well\n"+
		"penned, I have taken great pains to con it. Good\n"+
		"beauties, let me sustain no scorn; I am very\n"+
		"comptible, even to the least sinister usage.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Whence came you, sir?\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"I can say little more than I have studied, and that\n"+
		"question's out of my part. Good gentle one, give me\n"+
		"modest assurance if you be the lady of the house,\n"+
		"that I may proceed in my speech.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Are you a comedian?\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"No, my profound heart: and yet, by the very fangs\n"+
		"of malice I swear, I am not that I play. Are you\n"+
		"the lady of the house?\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"If I do not usurp myself, I am.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp\n"+
		"yourself; for what is yours to bestow is not yours\n"+
		"to reserve. But this is from my commission: I will\n"+
		"on with my speech in your praise, and then show you\n"+
		"the heart of my message.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Come to what is important in't: I forgive you the praise.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"Alas, I took great pains to study it, and 'tis poetical.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"It is the more like to be feigned: I pray you,\n"+
		"keep it in. I heard you were saucy at my gates,\n"+
		"and allowed your approach rather to wonder at you\n"+
		"than to hear you. If you be not mad, be gone; if\n"+
		"you have reason, be brief: 'tis not that time of\n"+
		"moon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue.\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"Will you hoist sail, sir? here lies your way.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"No, good swabber; I am to hull here a little\n"+
		"longer. Some mollification for your giant, sweet\n"+
		"lady. Tell me your mind: I am a messenger.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Sure, you have some hideous matter to deliver, when\n"+
		"the courtesy of it is so fearful. Speak your office.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"It alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture of\n"+
		"war, no taxation of homage: I hold the olive in my\n"+
		"hand; my words are as fun of peace as matter.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Yet you began rudely. What are you? what would you?\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"The rudeness that hath appeared in me have I\n"+
		"learned from my entertainment. What I am, and what I\n"+
		"would, are as secret as maidenhead; to your ears,\n"+
		"divinity, to any other's, profanation.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Give us the place alone: we will hear this divinity.\n"+
		"Exeunt MARIA and Attendants\n"+
		"Now, sir, what is your text?\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"Most sweet lady,--\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"A comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of it.\n"+
		"Where lies your text?\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"In Orsino's bosom.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"In his bosom! In what chapter of his bosom?\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"To answer by the method, in the first of his heart.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"O, I have read it: it is heresy. Have you no more to say?\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"Good madam, let me see your face.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate\n"+
		"with my face? You are now out of your text: but\n"+
		"we will draw the curtain and show you the picture.\n"+
		"Look you, sir, such a one I was this present: is't\n"+
		"not well done?\n"+
		"Unveiling\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"Excellently done, if God did all.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"'Tis in grain, sir; 'twill endure wind and weather.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"'Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white\n"+
		"Nature's own sweet and cunning hand laid on:\n"+
		"Lady, you are the cruell'st she alive,\n"+
		"If you will lead these graces to the grave\n"+
		"And leave the world no copy.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"O, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted; I will give\n"+
		"out divers schedules of my beauty: it shall be\n"+
		"inventoried, and every particle and utensil\n"+
		"labelled to my will: as, item, two lips,\n"+
		"indifferent red; item, two grey eyes, with lids to\n"+
		"them; item, one neck, one chin, and so forth. Were\n"+
		"you sent hither to praise me?\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"I see you what you are, you are too proud;\n"+
		"But, if you were the devil, you are fair.\n"+
		"My lord and master loves you: O, such love\n"+
		"Could be but recompensed, though you were crown'd\n"+
		"The nonpareil of beauty!\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"How does he love me?\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"With adorations, fertile tears,\n"+
		"With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Your lord does know my mind; I cannot love him:\n"+
		"Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble,\n"+
		"Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth;\n"+
		"In voices well divulged, free, learn'd and valiant;\n"+
		"And in dimension and the shape of nature\n"+
		"A gracious person: but yet I cannot love him;\n"+
		"He might have took his answer long ago.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"If I did love you in my master's flame,\n"+
		"With such a suffering, such a deadly life,\n"+
		"In your denial I would find no sense;\n"+
		"I would not understand it.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Why, what would you?\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"Make me a willow cabin at your gate,\n"+
		"And call upon my soul within the house;\n"+
		"Write loyal cantons of contemned love\n"+
		"And sing them loud even in the dead of night;\n"+
		"Halloo your name to the reverberate hills\n"+
		"And make the babbling gossip of the air\n"+
		"Cry out 'Olivia!' O, You should not rest\n"+
		"Between the elements of air and earth,\n"+
		"But you should pity me!\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"You might do much.\n"+
		"What is your parentage?\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:\n"+
		"I am a gentleman.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Get you to your lord;\n"+
		"I cannot love him: let him send no more;\n"+
		"Unless, perchance, you come to me again,\n"+
		"To tell me how he takes it. Fare you well:\n"+
		"I thank you for your pains: spend this for me.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"I am no fee'd post, lady; keep your purse:\n"+
		"My master, not myself, lacks recompense.\n"+
		"Love make his heart of flint that you shall love;\n"+
		"And let your fervor, like my master's, be\n"+
		"Placed in contempt! Farewell, fair cruelty.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"'What is your parentage?'\n"+
		"'Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:\n"+
		"I am a gentleman.' I'll be sworn thou art;\n"+
		"Thy tongue, thy face, thy limbs, actions and spirit,\n"+
		"Do give thee five-fold blazon: not too fast:\n"+
		"soft, soft!\n"+
		"Unless the master were the man. How now!\n"+
		"Even so quickly may one catch the plague?\n"+
		"Methinks I feel this youth's perfections\n"+
		"With an invisible and subtle stealth\n"+

		"Re-enter MALVOLIO\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"Here, madam, at your service.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Run after that same peevish messenger,\n"+
		"The county's man: he left this ring behind him,\n"+
		"Would I or not: tell him I'll none of it.\n"+
		"Desire him not to flatter with his lord,\n"+
		"Nor hold him up with hopes; I am not for him:\n"+
		"If that the youth will come this way to-morrow,\n"+
		"I'll give him reasons for't: hie thee, Malvolio.\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"Madam, I will.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"I do I know not what, and fear to find\n"+
		"Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind.\n"+
		"Fate, show thy force: ourselves we do not owe;\n"+
		"What is decreed must be, and be this so.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"ACT II\n"+
		"SCENE I. The sea-coast.\n"+
		"Enter ANTONIO and SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Will you stay no longer? nor will you not that I go with you?\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"By your patience, no. My stars shine darkly over\n"+
		"me: the malignancy of my fate might perhaps\n"+
		"distemper yours; therefore I shall crave of you your\n"+
		"leave that I may bear my evils alone: it were a bad\n"+
		"recompense for your love, to lay any of them on you.\n"+
		"ANTONIO: Let me yet know of you whither you are bound.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"No, sooth, sir: my determinate voyage is mere\n"+
		"extravagancy. But I perceive in you so excellent a\n"+
		"touch of modesty, that you will not extort from me\n"+
		"what I am willing to keep in; therefore it charges\n"+
		"me in manners the rather to express myself. You\n"+
		"must know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian,\n"+
		"which I called Roderigo. My father was that\n"+
		"Sebastian of Messaline, whom I know you have heard\n"+
		"of. He left behind him myself and a sister, both\n"+
		"born in an hour: if the heavens had been pleased,\n"+
		"would we had so ended! but you, sir, altered that;\n"+
		"for some hour before you took me from the breach of\n"+
		"the sea was my sister drowned.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Alas the day!\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"A lady, sir, though it was said she much resembled\n"+
		"me, was yet of many accounted beautiful: but,\n"+
		"though I could not with such estimable wonder\n"+
		"overfar believe that, yet thus far I will boldly\n"+
		"publish her; she bore a mind that envy could not but\n"+
		"call fair. She is drowned already, sir, with salt\n"+
		"water, though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Pardon me, sir, your bad entertainment.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"O good Antonio, forgive me your trouble.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"If you will not murder me for my love, let me be\n"+
		"your servant.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"If you will not undo what you have done, that is,\n"+
		"kill him whom you have recovered, desire it not.\n"+
		"Fare ye well at once: my bosom is full of kindness,\n"+
		"and I am yet so near the manners of my mother, that\n"+
		"upon the least occasion more mine eyes will tell\n"+
		"tales of me. I am bound to the Count Orsino's court: farewell.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"The gentleness of all the gods go with thee!\n"+
		"I have many enemies in Orsino's court,\n"+
		"Else would I very shortly see thee there.\n"+
		"But, come what may, I do adore thee so,\n"+
		"That danger shall seem sport, and I will go.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE II. A street.\n"+
		"Enter VIOLA, MALVOLIO following\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"Were not you even now with the Countess Olivia?\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"Even now, sir; on a moderate pace I have since\n"+
		"arrived but hither.\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"She returns this ring to you, sir: you might have\n"+
		"saved me my pains, to have taken it away yourself.\n"+
		"She adds, moreover, that you should put your lord\n"+
		"into a desperate assurance she will none of him:\n"+
		"and one thing more, that you be never so hardy to\n"+
		"come again in his affairs, unless it be to report\n"+
		"your lord's taking of this. Receive it so.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"She took the ring of me: I'll none of it.\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"Come, sir, you peevishly threw it to her; and her\n"+
		"will is, it should be so returned: if it be worth\n"+
		"stooping for, there it lies in your eye; if not, be\n"+
		"it his that finds it.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"I left no ring with her: what means this lady?\n"+
		"Fortune forbid my outside have not charm'd her!\n"+
		"She made good view of me; indeed, so much,\n"+
		"That sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue,\n"+
		"For she did speak in starts distractedly.\n"+
		"She loves me, sure; the cunning of her passion\n"+
		"Invites me in this churlish messenger.\n"+
		"None of my lord's ring! why, he sent her none.\n"+
		"I am the man: if it be so, as 'tis,\n"+
		"Poor lady, she were better love a dream.\n"+
		"Disguise, I see, thou art a wickedness,\n"+
		"Wherein the pregnant enemy does much.\n"+
		"How easy is it for the proper-false\n"+
		"In women's waxen hearts to set their forms!\n"+
		"Alas, our frailty is the cause, not we!\n"+
		"For such as we are made of, such we be.\n"+
		"How will this fadge? my master loves her dearly;\n"+
		"And I, poor monster, fond as much on him;\n"+
		"And she, mistaken, seems to dote on me.\n"+
		"What will become of this? As I am man,\n"+
		"My state is desperate for my master's love;\n"+
		"As I am woman,--now alas the day!--\n"+
		"What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!\n"+
		"O time! thou must untangle this, not I;\n"+
		"It is too hard a knot for me to untie!\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE III. OLIVIA's house.\n"+
		"Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Approach, Sir Andrew: not to be abed after\n"+
		"midnight is to be up betimes; and 'diluculo\n"+
		"surgere,' thou know'st,--\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"Nay, my troth, I know not: but I know, to be up\n"+
		"late is to be up late.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"A false conclusion: I hate it as an unfilled can.\n"+
		"To be up after midnight and to go to bed then, is\n"+
		"early: so that to go to bed after midnight is to go\n"+
		"to bed betimes. Does not our life consist of the\n"+
		"four elements?\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"Faith, so they say; but I think it rather consists\n"+
		"of eating and drinking.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Thou'rt a scholar; let us therefore eat and drink.\n"+
		"Marian, I say! a stoup of wine!\n"+
		"Enter Clown\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"Here comes the fool, i' faith.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"How now, my hearts! did you never see the picture\n"+
		"of 'we three'?\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Welcome, ass. Now let's have a catch.\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"By my troth, the fool has an excellent breast. I\n"+
		"had rather than forty shillings I had such a leg,\n"+
		"and so sweet a breath to sing, as the fool has. In\n"+
		"sooth, thou wast in very gracious fooling last\n"+
		"night, when thou spokest of Pigrogromitus, of the\n"+
		"Vapians passing the equinoctial of Queubus: 'twas\n"+
		"very good, i' faith. I sent thee sixpence for thy\n"+
		"leman: hadst it?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"I did impeticos thy gratillity; for Malvolio's nose\n"+
		"is no whipstock: my lady has a white hand, and the\n"+
		"Myrmidons are no bottle-ale houses.\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"Excellent! why, this is the best fooling, when all\n"+
		"is done. Now, a song.\n"+

		"Come on; there is sixpence for you: let's have a song.\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"There's a testril of me too: if one knight give a--\n"+

		"Would you have a love-song, or a song of good life?\n"+

		"Clown\n"+
		"Yes, by Saint Anne, and ginger shall be hot i' the\n"+

		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Thou'rt i' the right. Go, sir, rub your chain with\n"+

		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"Mistress Mary, if you prized my lady's favour at any\n"+
		"thing more than contempt, you would not give means\n"+

		"SIR ANDREW\n"+

		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Do't, knight: I'll write thee a challenge: or I'll\n"+

		"MARIA\n"+
		"Sweet Sir Toby, be patient for tonight: since the\n"+
		"youth of the count's was today with thy lady, she is\n"+
		"much out of quiet. For Monsieur Malvolio, let me\n"+
		"alone with him: if I do not gull him into a\n"+
		"nayword, and make him a common recreation, do not\n"+
		"think I have wit enough to lie straight in my bed:\n"+

		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Possess us, possess us; tell us something of him.\n"+

		"O, if I thought that I'ld beat him like a dog!\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"What, for being a puritan? thy exquisite reason,\n"+

		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"I have no exquisite reason for't, but I have reason\n"+
		"good enough.\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"The devil a puritan that he is, or any thing\n"+
		"constantly, but a time-pleaser; an affectioned ass,\n"+
		"that cons state without book and utters it by great\n"+
		"swarths: the best persuaded of himself, so\n"+
		"crammed, as he thinks, with excellencies, that it is\n"+
		"his grounds of faith that all that look on him love\n"+
		"him; and on that vice in him will my revenge find\n"+
		"notable cause to work.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"What wilt thou do?\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"I will drop in his way some obscure epistles of\n"+
		"love; wherein, by the colour of his beard, the shape\n"+
		"of his leg, the manner of his gait, the expressure\n"+
		"of his eye, forehead, and complexion, he shall find\n"+
		"himself most feelingly personated. I can write very\n"+
		"like my lady your niece: on a forgotten matter we\n"+
		"can hardly make distinction of our hands.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Excellent! I smell a device.\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"I have't in my nose too.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"He shall think, by the letters that thou wilt drop,\n"+
		"that they come from my niece, and that she's in\n"+
		"love with him.\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"My purpose is, indeed, a horse of that colour.\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"And your horse now would make him an ass.\n"+

		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"O, 'twill be admirable!\n"+

		"Enter DUKE ORSINO, VIOLA, CURIO, and others\n"+
		"DUKE ORSINO\n"+
		"Give me some music. Now, good morrow, friends.\n"+
		"Now, good Cesario, but that piece of song,\n"+
		"That old and antique song we heard last night:\n"+
		"Methought it did relieve my passion much,\n"+
		"More than light airs and recollected terms\n"+
		"Of these most brisk and giddy-paced times:\n"+
		"Come, but one verse.\n"+
		"CURIO\n"+
		"He is not here, so please your lordship that should sing it.\n"+
		"DUKE ORSINO\n"+
		"Who was it?\n"+
		"CURIO\n"+
		"Feste, the jester, my lord; a fool that the lady\n"+
		"Olivia's father took much delight in. He is about the house.\n"+
		"DUKE ORSINO\n"+
		"Seek him out, and play the tune the while.\n"+
		"Exit CURIO. Music plays\n"+
		"Come hither, boy: if ever thou shalt love,\n"+
		"In the sweet pangs of it remember me;\n"+
		"For such as I am all true lovers are,\n"+
		"Unstaid and skittish in all motions else,\n"+
		"Save in the constant image of the creature\n"+
		"That is beloved. How dost thou like this tune?\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"It gives a very echo to the seat\n"+
		"Where Love is throned.\n"+
		"DUKE ORSINO\n"+
		"Thou dost speak masterly:\n"+
		"My life upon't, young though thou art, thine eye\n"+
		"Hath stay'd upon some favour that it loves:\n"+
		"Hath it not, boy?\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"A little, by your favour.\n"+
		"DUKE ORSINO\n"+
		"What kind of woman is't?\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"Of your complexion.\n"+
		"DUKE ORSINO\n"+
		"She is not worth thee, then. What years, i' faith?\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"About your years, my lord.\n"+
		"DUKE ORSINO\n"+
		"Too old by heaven: let still the woman take\n"+
		"An elder than herself: so wears she to him,\n"+
		"So sways she level in her husband's heart:\n"+
		"For, boy, however we do praise ourselves,\n"+
		"Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm,\n"+
		"More longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn,\n"+
		"Than women's are.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"I think it well, my lord.\n"+
		"DUKE ORSINO\n"+
		"Then let thy love be younger than thyself,\n"+
		"Or thy affection cannot hold the bent;\n"+
		"For women are as roses, whose fair flower\n"+
		"Being once display'd, doth fall that very hour.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"And so they are: alas, that they are so;\n"+
		"To die, even when they to perfection grow!\n"+
		"Re-enter CURIO and Clown\n"+
		"DUKE ORSINO\n"+
		"O, fellow, come, the song we had last night.\n"+
		"Mark it, Cesario, it is old and plain;\n"+
		"The spinsters and the knitters in the sun\n"+
		"And the free maids that weave their thread with bones\n"+
		"Do use to chant it: it is silly sooth,\n"+
		"And dallies with the innocence of love,\n"+
		"Like the old age.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Are you ready, sir?\n"+
		"DUKE ORSINO\n"+
		"Ay; prithee, sing.\n"+
		"Music\n"+
		"SONG.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Come away, come away, death,\n"+
		"And in sad cypress let me be laid;\n"+
		"Fly away, fly away breath;\n"+
		"I am slain by a fair cruel maid.\n"+
		"My shroud of white, stuck all with yew,\n"+
		"O, prepare it!\n"+
		"My part of death, no one so true\n"+
		"Did share it.\n"+
		"Not a flower, not a flower sweet\n"+
		"On my black coffin let there be strown;\n"+
		"Not a friend, not a friend greet\n"+
		"My poor corpse, where my bones shall be thrown:\n"+
		"A thousand thousand sighs to save,\n"+
		"Lay me, O, where\n"+
		"Sad true lover never find my grave,\n"+
		"To weep there!\n"+
		"DUKE ORSINO\n"+
		"There's for thy pains.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"No pains, sir: I take pleasure in singing, sir.\n"+
		"DUKE ORSINO\n"+
		"I'll pay thy pleasure then.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Truly, sir, and pleasure will be paid, one time or another.\n"+
		"DUKE ORSINO\n"+
		"Give me now leave to leave thee.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Now, the melancholy god protect thee; and the\n"+
		"tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta, for\n"+
		"thy mind is a very opal. I would have men of such\n"+
		"constancy put to sea, that their business might be\n"+
		"every thing and their intent every where; for that's\n"+
		"it that always makes a good voyage of nothing. Farewell.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"DUKE ORSINO\n"+
		"Let all the rest give place.\n"+
		"CURIO and Attendants retire\n"+
		"Once more, Cesario,\n"+
		"Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty:\n"+
		"Tell her, my love, more noble than the world,\n"+
		"Prizes not quantity of dirty lands;\n"+
		"The parts that fortune hath bestow'd upon her,\n"+
		"Tell her, I hold as giddily as fortune;\n"+
		"But 'tis that miracle and queen of gems\n"+
		"That nature pranks her in attracts my soul.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"But if she cannot love you, sir?\n"+
		"DUKE ORSINO\n"+
		"I cannot be so answer'd.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"Sooth, but you must.\n"+
		"Say that some lady, as perhaps there is,\n"+
		"Hath for your love a great a pang of heart\n"+
		"As you have for Olivia: you cannot love her;\n"+
		"You tell her so; must she not then be answer'd?\n"+
		"DUKE ORSINO\n"+
		"There is no woman's sides\n"+
		"Can bide the beating of so strong a passion\n"+
		"As love doth give my heart; no woman's heart\n"+
		"So big, to hold so much; they lack retention\n"+
		"Alas, their love may be call'd appetite,\n"+
		"No motion of the liver, but the palate,\n"+
		"That suffer surfeit, cloyment and revolt;\n"+
		"But mine is all as hungry as the sea,\n"+
		"And can digest as much: make no compare\n"+
		"Between that love a woman can bear me\n"+
		"And that I owe Olivia.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"Ay, but I know--\n"+
		"DUKE ORSINO\n"+
		"What dost thou know?\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"Too well what love women to men may owe:\n"+
		"In faith, they are as true of heart as we.\n"+
		"My father had a daughter loved a man,\n"+
		"As it might be, perhaps, were I a woman,\n"+
		"I should your lordship.\n"+
		"DUKE ORSINO\n"+
		"And what's her history?\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"A blank, my lord. She never told her love,\n"+
		"But let concealment, like a worm i' the bud,\n"+
		"Feed on her damask cheek: she pined in thought,\n"+
		"And with a green and yellow melancholy\n"+
		"She sat like patience on a monument,\n"+
		"Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?\n"+
		"We men may say more, swear more: but indeed\n"+
		"Our shows are more than will; for still we prove\n"+
		"Much in our vows, but little in our love.\n"+
		"DUKE ORSINO\n"+
		"But died thy sister of her love, my boy?\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"I am all the daughters of my father's house,\n"+
		"And all the brothers too: and yet I know not.\n"+
		"Sir, shall I to this lady?\n"+
		"DUKE ORSINO\n"+
		"Ay, that's the theme.\n"+
		"To her in haste; give her this jewel; say,\n"+
		"My love can give no place, bide no denay.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+

		"Enter SIR TOBY BELCH, SIR ANDREW, and FABIAN\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Come thy ways, Signior Fabian.\n"+
		"FABIAN\n"+
		"Nay, I'll come: if I lose a scruple of this sport,\n"+
		"let me be boiled to death with melancholy.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly\n"+
		"rascally sheep-biter come by some notable shame?\n"+
		"FABIAN\n"+
		"I would exult, man: you know, he brought me out o'\n"+
		"favour with my lady about a bear-baiting here.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"To anger him we'll have the bear again; and we will\n"+
		"fool him black and blue: shall we not, Sir Andrew?\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"An we do not, it is pity of our lives.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Here comes the little villain.\n"+
		"Enter MARIA\n"+
		"How now, my metal of India!\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"Get ye all three into the box-tree: Malvolio's\n"+
		"coming down this walk: he has been yonder i' the\n"+
		"sun practising behavior to his own shadow this half\n"+
		"hour: observe him, for the love of mockery; for I\n"+
		"know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of\n"+
		"him. Close, in the name of jesting! Lie thou there,\n"+
		"Throws down a letter\n"+
		"for here comes the trout that must be caught with tickling.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"Enter MALVOLIO\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"'Tis but fortune; all is fortune. Maria once told\n"+
		"me she did affect me: and I have heard herself come\n"+
		"thus near, that, should she fancy, it should be one\n"+
		"of my complexion. Besides, she uses me with a more\n"+
		"exalted respect than any one else that follows her.\n"+
		"What should I think on't?\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Here's an overweening rogue!\n"+
		"FABIAN\n"+
		"O, peace! Contemplation makes a rare turkey-cock\n"+
		"of him: how he jets under his advanced plumes!\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"'Slight, I could so beat the rogue!\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Peace, I say.\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"To be Count Malvolio!\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Ah, rogue!\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"Pistol him, pistol him.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Peace, peace!\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"There is example for't; the lady of the Strachy\n"+
		"married the yeoman of the wardrobe.\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"Fie on him, Jezebel!\n"+
		"FABIAN\n"+
		"O, peace! now he's deeply in: look how\n"+
		"imagination blows him.\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"Having been three months married to her, sitting in\n"+
		"my state,--\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"O, for a stone-bow, to hit him in the eye!\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"Calling my officers about me, in my branched velvet\n"+
		"gown; having come from a day-bed, where I have left\n"+
		"Olivia sleeping,--\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Fire and brimstone!\n"+
		"FABIAN\n"+
		"O, peace, peace!\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"And then to have the humour of state; and after a\n"+
		"demure travel of regard, telling them I know my\n"+
		"place as I would they should do theirs, to for my\n"+
		"kinsman Toby,--\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Bolts and shackles!\n"+
		"FABIAN\n"+
		"O peace, peace, peace! now, now.\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"Seven of my people, with an obedient start, make\n"+
		"out for him: I frown the while; and perchance wind\n"+
		"up watch, or play with my--some rich jewel. Toby\n"+
		"approaches; courtesies there to me,--\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Shall this fellow live?\n"+
		"FABIAN\n"+
		"Though our silence be drawn from us with cars, yet peace.\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"I extend my hand to him thus, quenching my familiar\n"+
		"smile with an austere regard of control,--\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"And does not Toby take you a blow o' the lips then?\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"Saying, 'Cousin Toby, my fortunes having cast me on\n"+

		"What, what?\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"'You must amend your drunkenness.'\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Out, scab!\n"+
		"FABIAN\n"+
		"Nay, patience, or we break the sinews of our plot.\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"'Besides, you waste the treasure of your time with\n"+

		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"That's me, I warrant you.\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"'One Sir Andrew,'--\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"I knew 'twas I; for many do call me fool.\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"What employment have we here?\n"+
		"Taking up the letter\n"+
		"FABIAN\n"+
		"Now is the woodcock near the gin.\n"+

		"O, peace! and the spirit of humour intimate reading\n"+
		"aloud to him!\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"By my life, this is my lady's hand these be her\n"+
		"very C's, her U's and her T's and thus makes she her\n"+
		"great P's. It is, in contempt of question, her hand.\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"Her C's, her U's and her T's: why that?\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"[Reads] 'To the unknown beloved, this, and my good\n"+

		"Soft! and the impressure her Lucrece, with which she\n"+

		"FABIAN\n"+
		"What dish o' poison has she dressed him!\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"And with what wing the staniel cheques at it!\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"'I may command where I adore.' Why, she may command\n"+
		"me: I serve her; she is my lady. Why, this is\n"+
		"evident to any formal capacity; there is no\n"+
		"obstruction in this: and the end,--what should\n"+
		"that alphabetical position portend? If I could make\n"+
		"that resemble something in me,--Softly! M, O, A,\n"+
		"I,--\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"O, ay, make up that: he is now at a cold scent.\n"+
		"FABIAN\n"+

		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"M,--Malvolio; M,--why, that begins my name.\n"+
		"FABIAN\n"+
		"Did not I say he would work it out? the cur is\n"+
		"excellent at faults.\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"M,--but then there is no consonancy in the sequel;\n"+
		"that suffers under probation A should follow but O does.\n"+
		"FABIAN\n"+
		"And O shall end, I hope.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Ay, or I'll cudgel him, and make him cry O!\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"And then I comes behind.\n"+
		"FABIAN\n"+
		"Ay, an you had any eye behind you, you might see\n"+

		"you.\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"M, O, A, I; this simulation is not as the former: and\n"+
		"yet, to crush this a little, it would bow to me, for\n"+
		"every one of these letters are in my name. Soft!\n"+

		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Wilt thou set thy foot o' my neck?\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"Or o' mine either?\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Shall I play my freedom at traytrip, and become thy\n"+
		"bond-slave?\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"I' faith, or I either?\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Why, thou hast put him in such a dream, that when\n"+
		"the image of it leaves him he must run mad.\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"Nay, but say true; does it work upon him?\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Like aqua-vitae with a midwife.\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"If you will then see the fruits of the sport, mark\n"+
		"his first approach before my lady: he will come to\n"+
		"her in yellow stockings, and 'tis a colour she\n"+
		"abhors, and cross-gartered, a fashion she detests;\n"+
		"and he will smile upon her, which will now be so\n"+
		"unsuitable to her disposition, being addicted to a\n"+
		"melancholy as she is, that it cannot but turn him\n"+
		"into a notable contempt. If you will see it, follow\n"+
		"me.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"To the gates of Tartar, thou most excellent devil of wit!\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"I'll make one too.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT III\n"+
		"SCENE I. OLIVIA's garden.\n"+
		"Enter VIOLA, and Clown with a tabour\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"Save thee, friend, and thy music: dost thou live by\n"+
		"thy tabour?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"No, sir, I live by the church.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"Art thou a churchman?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"No such matter, sir: I do live by the church; for\n"+
		"I do live at my house, and my house doth stand by\n"+
		"the church.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"So thou mayst say, the king lies by a beggar, if a\n"+
		"beggar dwell near him; or, the church stands by thy\n"+
		"tabour, if thy tabour stand by the church.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"You have said, sir. To see this age! A sentence is\n"+
		"but a cheveril glove to a good wit: how quickly the\n"+
		"wrong side may be turned outward!\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"Nay, that's certain; they that dally nicely with\n"+
		"words may quickly make them wanton.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"I would, therefore, my sister had had no name, sir.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"Why, man?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Why, sir, her name's a word; and to dally with that\n"+
		"word might make my sister wanton. But indeed words\n"+
		"are very rascals since bonds disgraced them.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"Thy reason, man?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Troth, sir, I can yield you none without words; and\n"+
		"words are grown so false, I am loath to prove\n"+
		"reason with them.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"I warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothing.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Not so, sir, I do care for something; but in my\n"+
		"conscience, sir, I do not care for you: if that be\n"+
		"to care for nothing, sir, I would it would make you invisible.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"Art not thou the Lady Olivia's fool?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"No, indeed, sir; the Lady Olivia has no folly: she\n"+
		"will keep no fool, sir, till she be married; and\n"+
		"fools are as like husbands as pilchards are to\n"+
		"herrings; the husband's the bigger: I am indeed not\n"+
		"her fool, but her corrupter of words.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"I saw thee late at the Count Orsino's.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Foolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the sun,\n"+
		"it shines every where. I would be sorry, sir, but\n"+
		"the fool should be as oft with your master as with\n"+
		"my mistress: I think I saw your wisdom there.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"Nay, an thou pass upon me, I'll no more with thee.\n"+
		"Hold, there's expenses for thee.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Now Jove, in his next commodity of hair, send thee a beard!\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"By my troth, I'll tell thee, I am almost sick for\n"+
		"one;\n"+
		"Aside\n"+
		"though I would not have it grow on my chin. Is thy\n"+
		"lady within?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Would not a pair of these have bred, sir?\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"Yes, being kept together and put to use.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"I would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia, sir, to bring\n"+
		"a Cressida to this Troilus.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"I understand you, sir; 'tis well begged.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"The matter, I hope, is not great, sir, begging but\n"+
		"a beggar: Cressida was a beggar. My lady is\n"+
		"within, sir. I will construe to them whence you\n"+
		"come; who you are and what you would are out of my\n"+
		"welkin, I might say 'element,' but the word is over-worn.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"This fellow is wise enough to play the fool;\n"+
		"And to do that well craves a kind of wit:\n"+
		"He must observe their mood on whom he jests,\n"+
		"The quality of persons, and the time,\n"+
		"And, like the haggard, cheque at every feather\n"+
		"That comes before his eye. This is a practise\n"+
		"As full of labour as a wise man's art\n"+
		"For folly that he wisely shows is fit;\n"+
		"But wise men, folly-fall'n, quite taint their wit.\n"+
		"Enter SIR TOBY BELCH, and SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Save you, gentleman.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"And you, sir.\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"Dieu vous garde, monsieur.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"Et vous aussi; votre serviteur.\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"I hope, sir, you are; and I am yours.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Will you encounter the house? my niece is desirous\n"+
		"you should enter, if your trade be to her.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"I am bound to your niece, sir; I mean, she is the\n"+
		"list of my voyage.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Taste your legs, sir; put them to motion.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"My legs do better understand me, sir, than I\n"+
		"understand what you mean by bidding me taste my legs.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"I mean, to go, sir, to enter.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"I will answer you with gait and entrance. But we\n"+
		"are prevented.\n"+
		"Enter OLIVIA and MARIA\n"+
		"Most excellent accomplished lady, the heavens rain\n"+
		"odours on you!\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"That youth's a rare courtier: 'Rain odours;' well.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"My matter hath no voice, to your own most pregnant\n"+
		"and vouchsafed ear.\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"'Odours,' 'pregnant' and 'vouchsafed:' I'll get 'em\n"+
		"all three all ready.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Let the garden door be shut, and leave me to my hearing.\n"+
		"Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH, SIR ANDREW, and MARIA\n"+
		"Give me your hand, sir.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"My duty, madam, and most humble service.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"What is your name?\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"Cesario is your servant's name, fair princess.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"My servant, sir! 'Twas never merry world\n"+
		"Since lowly feigning was call'd compliment:\n"+
		"You're servant to the Count Orsino, youth.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"And he is yours, and his must needs be yours:\n"+
		"Your servant's servant is your servant, madam.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"For him, I think not on him: for his thoughts,\n"+
		"Would they were blanks, rather than fill'd with me!\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"Madam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts\n"+
		"On his behalf.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"O, by your leave, I pray you,\n"+
		"I bade you never speak again of him:\n"+
		"But, would you undertake another suit,\n"+
		"I had rather hear you to solicit that\n"+
		"Than music from the spheres.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"Dear lady,--\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Give me leave, beseech you. I did send,\n"+
		"After the last enchantment you did here,\n"+
		"A ring in chase of you: so did I abuse\n"+
		"Myself, my servant and, I fear me, you:\n"+
		"Under your hard construction must I sit,\n"+
		"To force that on you, in a shameful cunning,\n"+
		"Which you knew none of yours: what might you think?\n"+
		"Have you not set mine honour at the stake\n"+
		"And baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts\n"+
		"That tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiving\n"+
		"Enough is shown: a cypress, not a bosom,\n"+
		"Hideth my heart. So, let me hear you speak.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"I pity you.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"That's a degree to love.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"No, not a grize; for 'tis a vulgar proof,\n"+
		"That very oft we pity enemies.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Why, then, methinks 'tis time to smile again.\n"+
		"O, world, how apt the poor are to be proud!\n"+
		"If one should be a prey, how much the better\n"+
		"To fall before the lion than the wolf!\n"+
		"Clock strikes\n"+
		"The clock upbraids me with the waste of time.\n"+
		"Be not afraid, good youth, I will not have you:\n"+
		"And yet, when wit and youth is come to harvest,\n"+
		"Your were is alike to reap a proper man:\n"+
		"There lies your way, due west.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"Then westward-ho! Grace and good disposition\n"+
		"Attend your ladyship!\n"+
		"You'll nothing, madam, to my lord by me?\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Stay:\n"+
		"I prithee, tell me what thou thinkest of me.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"That you do think you are not what you are.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"If I think so, I think the same of you.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"Then think you right: I am not what I am.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"I would you were as I would have you be!\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"Would it be better, madam, than I am?\n"+
		"I wish it might, for now I am your fool.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"O, what a deal of scorn looks beautiful\n"+
		"In the contempt and anger of his lip!\n"+
		"A murderous guilt shows not itself more soon\n"+
		"Than love that would seem hid: love's night is noon.\n"+
		"Cesario, by the roses of the spring,\n"+
		"By maidhood, honour, truth and every thing,\n"+
		"I love thee so, that, maugre all thy pride,\n"+
		"Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide.\n"+
		"Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,\n"+
		"For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause,\n"+
		"But rather reason thus with reason fetter,\n"+
		"Love sought is good, but given unsought better.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"By innocence I swear, and by my youth\n"+
		"I have one heart, one bosom and one truth,\n"+
		"And that no woman has; nor never none\n"+
		"Shall mistress be of it, save I alone.\n"+
		"And so adieu, good madam: never more\n"+
		"Will I my master's tears to you deplore.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Yet come again; for thou perhaps mayst move\n"+
		"That heart, which now abhors, to like his love.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. OLIVIA's house.\n"+
		"Enter SIR TOBY BELCH, SIR ANDREW, and FABIAN\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"No, faith, I'll not stay a jot longer.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Thy reason, dear venom, give thy reason.\n"+
		"FABIAN\n"+
		"You must needs yield your reason, Sir Andrew.\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"Marry, I saw your niece do more favours to the\n"+
		"count's serving-man than ever she bestowed upon me;\n"+
		"I saw't i' the orchard.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Did she see thee the while, old boy? tell me that.\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"As plain as I see you now.\n"+
		"FABIAN\n"+
		"This was a great argument of love in her toward you.\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"'Slight, will you make an ass o' me?\n"+
		"FABIAN\n"+
		"I will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths of\n"+
		"judgment and reason.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"And they have been grand-jury-men since before Noah\n"+
		"was a sailor.\n"+
		"FABIAN\n"+
		"She did show favour to the youth in your sight only\n"+
		"to exasperate you, to awake your dormouse valour, to\n"+
		"put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver.\n"+
		"You should then have accosted her; and with some\n"+
		"excellent jests, fire-new from the mint, you should\n"+
		"have banged the youth into dumbness. This was\n"+
		"looked for at your hand, and this was balked: the\n"+
		"double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash\n"+
		"off, and you are now sailed into the north of my\n"+
		"lady's opinion; where you will hang like an icicle\n"+
		"on a Dutchman's beard, unless you do redeem it by\n"+
		"some laudable attempt either of valour or policy.\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"An't be any way, it must be with valour; for policy\n"+
		"I hate: I had as lief be a Brownist as a\n"+
		"politician.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Why, then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis of\n"+
		"valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight\n"+
		"with him; hurt him in eleven places: my niece shall\n"+
		"take note of it; and assure thyself, there is no\n"+
		"love-broker in the world can more prevail in man's\n"+
		"commendation with woman than report of valour.\n"+
		"FABIAN\n"+
		"There is no way but this, Sir Andrew.\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"Will either of you bear me a challenge to him?\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Go, write it in a martial hand; be curst and brief;\n"+
		"it is no matter how witty, so it be eloquent and fun\n"+
		"of invention: taunt him with the licence of ink:\n"+
		"if thou thou'st him some thrice, it shall not be\n"+
		"amiss; and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of\n"+
		"paper, although the sheet were big enough for the\n"+
		"bed of Ware in England, set 'em down: go, about it.\n"+
		"Let there be gall enough in thy ink, though thou\n"+
		"write with a goose-pen, no matter: about it.\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"Where shall I find you?\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"We'll call thee at the cubiculo: go.\n"+
		"Exit SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"FABIAN\n"+
		"This is a dear manikin to you, Sir Toby.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"I have been dear to him, lad, some two thousand\n"+
		"strong, or so.\n"+
		"FABIAN\n"+
		"We shall have a rare letter from him: but you'll\n"+
		"not deliver't?\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Never trust me, then; and by all means stir on the\n"+
		"youth to an answer. I think oxen and wainropes\n"+
		"cannot hale them together. For Andrew, if he were\n"+
		"opened, and you find so much blood in his liver as\n"+
		"will clog the foot of a flea, I'll eat the rest of\n"+
		"the anatomy.\n"+
		"FABIAN\n"+
		"And his opposite, the youth, bears in his visage no\n"+
		"great presage of cruelty.\n"+
		"Enter MARIA\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Look, where the youngest wren of nine comes.\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"If you desire the spleen, and will laugh yourself\n"+
		"into stitches, follow me. Yond gull Malvolio is\n"+
		"turned heathen, a very renegado; for there is no\n"+
		"Christian, that means to be saved by believing\n"+
		"rightly, can ever believe such impossible passages\n"+
		"of grossness. He's in yellow stockings.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"And cross-gartered?\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"Most villanously; like a pedant that keeps a school\n"+
		"i' the church. I have dogged him, like his\n"+
		"murderer. He does obey every point of the letter\n"+
		"that I dropped to betray him: he does smile his\n"+
		"face into more lines than is in the new map with the\n"+
		"augmentation of the Indies: you have not seen such\n"+
		"a thing as 'tis. I can hardly forbear hurling things\n"+
		"at him. I know my lady will strike him: if she do,\n"+
		"he'll smile and take't for a great favour.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Come, bring us, bring us where he is.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. A street.\n"+
		"Enter SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"I would not by my will have troubled you;\n"+
		"But, since you make your pleasure of your pains,\n"+
		"I will no further chide you.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"I could not stay behind you: my desire,\n"+
		"More sharp than filed steel, did spur me forth;\n"+
		"And not all love to see you, though so much\n"+
		"As might have drawn one to a longer voyage,\n"+
		"But jealousy what might befall your travel,\n"+
		"Being skilless in these parts; which to a stranger,\n"+
		"Unguided and unfriended, often prove\n"+
		"Rough and unhospitable: my willing love,\n"+
		"The rather by these arguments of fear,\n"+
		"Set forth in your pursuit.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"My kind Antonio,\n"+
		"I can no other answer make but thanks,\n"+
		"And thanks; and ever [ ] oft good turns\n"+
		"Are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay:\n"+
		"But, were my worth as is my conscience firm,\n"+
		"You should find better dealing. What's to do?\n"+
		"Shall we go see the reliques of this town?\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"To-morrow, sir: best first go see your lodging.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"I am not weary, and 'tis long to night:\n"+
		"I pray you, let us satisfy our eyes\n"+
		"With the memorials and the things of fame\n"+
		"That do renown this city.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Would you'ld pardon me;\n"+
		"I do not without danger walk these streets:\n"+
		"Once, in a sea-fight, 'gainst the count his galleys\n"+
		"I did some service; of such note indeed,\n"+
		"That were I ta'en here it would scarce be answer'd.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"Belike you slew great number of his people.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"The offence is not of such a bloody nature;\n"+
		"Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel\n"+
		"Might well have given us bloody argument.\n"+
		"It might have since been answer'd in repaying\n"+
		"What we took from them; which, for traffic's sake,\n"+
		"Most of our city did: only myself stood out;\n"+
		"For which, if I be lapsed in this place,\n"+
		"I shall pay dear.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"Do not then walk too open.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"It doth not fit me. Hold, sir, here's my purse.\n"+
		"In the south suburbs, at the Elephant,\n"+
		"Is best to lodge: I will bespeak our diet,\n"+
		"Whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge\n"+
		"With viewing of the town: there shall you have me.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"Why I your purse?\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Haply your eye shall light upon some toy\n"+
		"You have desire to purchase; and your store,\n"+
		"I think, is not for idle markets, sir.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"I'll be your purse-bearer and leave you\n"+
		"For an hour.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"To the Elephant.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"I do remember.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV. OLIVIA's garden.\n"+
		"Enter OLIVIA and MARIA\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"I have sent after him: he says he'll come;\n"+
		"How shall I feast him? what bestow of him?\n"+
		"For youth is bought more oft than begg'd or borrow'd.\n"+
		"I speak too loud.\n"+
		"Where is Malvolio? he is sad and civil,\n"+
		"And suits well for a servant with my fortunes:\n"+
		"Where is Malvolio?\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"He's coming, madam; but in very strange manner. He\n"+
		"is, sure, possessed, madam.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Why, what's the matter? does he rave?\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"No. madam, he does nothing but smile: your\n"+
		"ladyship were best to have some guard about you, if\n"+
		"he come; for, sure, the man is tainted in's wits.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Go call him hither.\n"+
		"Exit MARIA\n"+
		"I am as mad as he,\n"+
		"If sad and merry madness equal be.\n"+
		"Re-enter MARIA, with MALVOLIO\n"+
		"How now, Malvolio!\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"Sweet lady, ho, ho.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Smilest thou?\n"+
		"I sent for thee upon a sad occasion.\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"Sad, lady! I could be sad: this does make some\n"+
		"obstruction in the blood, this cross-gartering; but\n"+
		"what of that? if it please the eye of one, it is\n"+
		"with me as the very true sonnet is, 'Please one, and\n"+
		"please all.'\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Why, how dost thou, man? what is the matter with thee?\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"Not black in my mind, though yellow in my legs. It\n"+
		"did come to his hands, and commands shall be\n"+
		"executed: I think we do know the sweet Roman hand.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Wilt thou go to bed, Malvolio?\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"To bed! ay, sweet-heart, and I'll come to thee.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"God comfort thee! Why dost thou smile so and kiss\n"+
		"thy hand so oft?\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"How do you, Malvolio?\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"At your request! yes; nightingales answer daws.\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady?\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"'Be not afraid of greatness:' 'twas well writ.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"What meanest thou by that, Malvolio?\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"'Some are born great,'--\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Ha!\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"'Some achieve greatness,'--\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"What sayest thou?\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"'And some have greatness thrust upon them.'\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Heaven restore thee!\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"'Remember who commended thy yellow stocking s,'--\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Thy yellow stockings!\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"'And wished to see thee cross-gartered.'\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Cross-gartered!\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"'Go to thou art made, if thou desirest to be so;'--\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Am I made?\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"'If not, let me see thee a servant still.'\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Why, this is very midsummer madness.\n"+
		"Enter Servant\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"Madam, the young gentleman of the Count Orsino's is\n"+
		"returned: I could hardly entreat him back: he\n"+
		"attends your ladyship's pleasure.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"I'll come to him.\n"+
		"Exit Servant\n"+
		"Good Maria, let this fellow be looked to. Where's\n"+
		"my cousin Toby? Let some of my people have a special\n"+
		"care of him: I would not have him miscarry for the\n"+
		"half of my dowry.\n"+
		"Exeunt OLIVIA and MARIA\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"O, ho! do you come near me now? no worse man than\n"+
		"Sir Toby to look to me! This concurs directly with\n"+
		"the letter: she sends him on purpose, that I may\n"+
		"appear stubborn to him; for she incites me to that\n"+
		"in the letter. 'Cast thy humble slough,' says she;\n"+
		"'be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants;\n"+

		"consequently sets down the manner how; as, a sad\n"+
		"face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the\n"+
		"habit of some sir of note, and so forth. I have\n"+
		"limed her; but it is Jove's doing, and Jove make me\n"+
		"thankful! And when she went away now, 'Let this\n"+
		"fellow be looked to:' fellow! not Malvolio, nor\n"+
		"after my degree, but fellow. Why, every thing\n"+
		"adheres together, that no dram of a scruple, no\n"+
		"scruple of a scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous\n"+
		"or unsafe circumstance--What can be said? Nothing\n"+
		"that can be can come between me and the full\n"+
		"prospect of my hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is the\n"+
		"doer of this, and he is to be thanked.\n"+
		"Re-enter MARIA, with SIR TOBY BELCH and FABIAN\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Which way is he, in the name of sanctity? If all\n"+
		"the devils of hell be drawn in little, and Legion\n"+
		"himself possessed him, yet I'll speak to him.\n"+
		"FABIAN\n"+
		"Here he is, here he is. How is't with you, sir?\n"+
		"how is't with you, man?\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"Go off; I discard you: let me enjoy my private: go\n"+
		"off.\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"Lo, how hollow the fiend speaks within him! did not\n"+
		"I tell you? Sir Toby, my lady prays you to have a\n"+
		"care of him.\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"Ah, ha! does she so?\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Go to, go to; peace, peace; we must deal gently\n"+
		"with him: let me alone. How do you, Malvolio? how\n"+
		"is't with you? What, man! defy the devil:\n"+
		"consider, he's an enemy to mankind.\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"Do you know what you say?\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"La you, an you speak ill of the devil, how he takes\n"+
		"it at heart! Pray God, he be not bewitched!\n"+
		"FABIAN\n"+
		"Carry his water to the wise woman.\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"Marry, and it shall be done to-morrow morning, if I\n"+
		"live. My lady would not lose him for more than I'll say.\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"How now, mistress!\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"O Lord!\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Prithee, hold thy peace; this is not the way: do\n"+
		"you not see you move him? let me alone with him.\n"+
		"FABIAN\n"+
		"No way but gentleness; gently, gently: the fiend is\n"+
		"rough, and will not be roughly used.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Why, how now, my bawcock! how dost thou, chuck?\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"Sir!\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Ay, Biddy, come with me. What, man! 'tis not for\n"+
		"gravity to play at cherry-pit with Satan: hang\n"+
		"him, foul collier!\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"Get him to say his prayers, good Sir Toby, get him to pray.\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"My prayers, minx!\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"No, I warrant you, he will not hear of godliness.\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"Go, hang yourselves all! you are idle shallow\n"+
		"things: I am not of your element: you shall know\n"+
		"more hereafter.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Is't possible?\n"+
		"FABIAN\n"+
		"If this were played upon a stage now, I could\n"+
		"condemn it as an improbable fiction.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"His very genius hath taken the infection of the device, man.\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"Nay, pursue him now, lest the device take air and taint.\n"+
		"FABIAN\n"+
		"Why, we shall make him mad indeed.\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"The house will be the quieter.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Come, we'll have him in a dark room and bound. My\n"+
		"niece is already in the belief that he's mad: we\n"+
		"may carry it thus, for our pleasure and his penance,\n"+
		"till our very pastime, tired out of breath, prompt\n"+
		"us to have mercy on him: at which time we will\n"+
		"bring the device to the bar and crown thee for a\n"+
		"finder of madmen. But see, but see.\n"+
		"Enter SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"FABIAN\n"+
		"More matter for a May morning.\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"Here's the challenge, read it: warrant there's\n"+
		"vinegar and pepper in't.\n"+
		"FABIAN\n"+
		"Is't so saucy?\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"Ay, is't, I warrant him: do but read.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Give me.\n"+
		"Reads\n"+
		"'Youth, whatsoever thou art, thou art but a scurvy fellow.'\n"+
		"FABIAN\n"+
		"Good, and valiant.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"[Reads] 'Wonder not, nor admire not in thy mind,\n"+
		"why I do call thee so, for I will show thee no reason for't.'\n"+
		"FABIAN\n"+
		"A good note; that keeps you from the blow of the law.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"[Reads] 'Thou comest to the lady Olivia, and in my\n"+
		"sight she uses thee kindly: but thou liest in thy\n"+
		"throat; that is not the matter I challenge thee for.'\n"+
		"FABIAN\n"+
		"Very brief, and to exceeding good sense--less.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"[Reads] 'I will waylay thee going home; where if it\n"+
		"be thy chance to kill me,'--\n"+
		"FABIAN\n"+
		"Good.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"[Reads] 'Thou killest me like a rogue and a villain.'\n"+
		"FABIAN\n"+
		"Still you keep o' the windy side of the law: good.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"[Reads] 'Fare thee well; and God have mercy upon\n"+
		"one of our souls! He may have mercy upon mine; but\n"+

		"ANDREW AGUECHEEK.\n"+
		"If this letter move him not, his legs cannot:\n"+
		"I'll give't him.\n"+
		"MARIA\n"+
		"You may have very fit occasion for't: he is now in\n"+
		"some commerce with my lady, and will by and by depart.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Go, Sir Andrew: scout me for him at the corner the\n"+
		"orchard like a bum-baily: so soon as ever thou seest\n"+
		"him, draw; and, as thou drawest swear horrible; for\n"+
		"it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath, with a\n"+
		"swaggering accent sharply twanged off, gives manhood\n"+
		"more approbation than ever proof itself would have\n"+
		"earned him. Away!\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"Nay, let me alone for swearing.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Now will not I deliver his letter: for the behavior\n"+
		"of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good\n"+
		"capacity and breeding; his employment between his\n"+
		"lord and my niece confirms no less: therefore this\n"+
		"letter, being so excellently ignorant, will breed no\n"+
		"terror in the youth: he will find it comes from a\n"+
		"clodpole. But, sir, I will deliver his challenge by\n"+
		"word of mouth; set upon Aguecheek a notable report\n"+
		"of valour; and drive the gentleman, as I know his\n"+
		"youth will aptly receive it, into a most hideous\n"+
		"opinion of his rage, skill, fury and impetuosity.\n"+
		"This will so fright them both that they will kill\n"+
		"one another by the look, like cockatrices.\n"+
		"Re-enter OLIVIA, with VIOLA\n"+
		"FABIAN\n"+

		"I will meditate the while upon some horrid message\n"+
		"for a challenge.\n"+
		"Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH, FABIAN, and MARIA\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"I have said too much unto a heart of stone\n"+
		"And laid mine honour too unchary out:\n"+
		"There's something in me that reproves my fault;\n"+
		"But such a headstrong potent fault it is,\n"+
		"That it but mocks reproof.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"With the same 'havior that your passion bears\n"+
		"Goes on my master's grief.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Here, wear this jewel for me, 'tis my picture;\n"+
		"Refuse it not; it hath no tongue to vex you;\n"+
		"And I beseech you come again to-morrow.\n"+
		"What shall you ask of me that I'll deny,\n"+
		"That honour saved may upon asking give?\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"Nothing but this; your true love for my master.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"How with mine honour may I give him that\n"+
		"Which I have given to you?\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"I will acquit you.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Well, come again to-morrow: fare thee well:\n"+
		"A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"Re-enter SIR TOBY BELCH and FABIAN\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Gentleman, God save thee.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"And you, sir.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"That defence thou hast, betake thee to't: of what\n"+
		"nature the wrongs are thou hast done him, I know\n"+
		"not; but thy intercepter, full of despite, bloody as\n"+
		"the hunter, attends thee at the orchard-end:\n"+
		"dismount thy tuck, be yare in thy preparation, for\n"+
		"thy assailant is quick, skilful and deadly.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"You mistake, sir; I am sure no man hath any quarrel\n"+
		"to me: my remembrance is very free and clear from\n"+
		"any image of offence done to any man.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"You'll find it otherwise, I assure you: therefore,\n"+
		"if you hold your life at any price, betake you to\n"+
		"your guard; for your opposite hath in him what\n"+
		"youth, strength, skill and wrath can furnish man withal.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"I pray you, sir, what is he?\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"He is knight, dubbed with unhatched rapier and on\n"+
		"carpet consideration; but he is a devil in private\n"+
		"brawl: souls and bodies hath he divorced three; and\n"+
		"his incensement at this moment is so implacable,\n"+
		"that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death\n"+
		"and sepulchre. Hob, nob, is his word; give't or take't.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"I will return again into the house and desire some\n"+
		"conduct of the lady. I am no fighter. I have heard\n"+
		"of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on\n"+
		"others, to taste their valour: belike this is a man\n"+
		"of that quirk.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Sir, no; his indignation derives itself out of a\n"+
		"very competent injury: therefore, get you on and\n"+
		"give him his desire. Back you shall not to the\n"+
		"house, unless you undertake that with me which with\n"+
		"as much safety you might answer him: therefore, on,\n"+
		"or strip your sword stark naked; for meddle you\n"+
		"must, that's certain, or forswear to wear iron about you.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"This is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you, do me\n"+
		"this courteous office, as to know of the knight what\n"+
		"my offence to him is: it is something of my\n"+
		"negligence, nothing of my purpose.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"I will do so. Signior Fabian, stay you by this\n"+
		"gentleman till my return.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"Pray you, sir, do you know of this matter?\n"+
		"FABIAN\n"+
		"I know the knight is incensed against you, even to a\n"+
		"mortal arbitrement; but nothing of the circumstance more.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"I beseech you, what manner of man is he?\n"+
		"FABIAN\n"+
		"Nothing of that wonderful promise, to read him by\n"+
		"his form, as you are like to find him in the proof\n"+
		"of his valour. He is, indeed, sir, the most skilful,\n"+
		"bloody and fatal opposite that you could possibly\n"+
		"have found in any part of Illyria. Will you walk\n"+
		"towards him? I will make your peace with him if I\n"+
		"can.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"I shall be much bound to you for't: I am one that\n"+
		"had rather go with sir priest than sir knight: I\n"+
		"care not who knows so much of my mettle.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"Re-enter SIR TOBY BELCH, with SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Why, man, he's a very devil; I have not seen such a\n"+
		"firago. I had a pass with him, rapier, scabbard and\n"+
		"all, and he gives me the stuck in with such a mortal\n"+
		"motion, that it is inevitable; and on the answer, he\n"+
		"pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they\n"+
		"step on. They say he has been fencer to the Sophy.\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"Pox on't, I'll not meddle with him.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Ay, but he will not now be pacified: Fabian can\n"+
		"scarce hold him yonder.\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"Plague on't, an I thought he had been valiant and so\n"+
		"cunning in fence, I'ld have seen him damned ere I'ld\n"+
		"have challenged him. Let him let the matter slip,\n"+
		"and I'll give him my horse, grey Capilet.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"I'll make the motion: stand here, make a good show\n"+
		"on't: this shall end without the perdition of souls.\n"+
		"Aside\n"+
		"Marry, I'll ride your horse as well as I ride you.\n"+
		"Re-enter FABIAN and VIOLA\n"+
		"To FABIAN\n"+
		"I have his horse to take up the quarrel:\n"+
		"I have persuaded him the youth's a devil.\n"+
		"FABIAN\n"+
		"He is as horribly conceited of him; and pants and\n"+
		"looks pale, as if a bear were at his heels.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"[To VIOLA] There's no remedy, sir; he will fight\n"+
		"with you for's oath sake: marry, he hath better\n"+
		"bethought him of his quarrel, and he finds that now\n"+
		"scarce to be worth talking of: therefore draw, for\n"+
		"the supportance of his vow; he protests he will not hurt you.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"[Aside] Pray God defend me! A little thing would\n"+
		"make me tell them how much I lack of a man.\n"+
		"FABIAN\n"+
		"Give ground, if you see him furious.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Come, Sir Andrew, there's no remedy; the gentleman\n"+
		"will, for his honour's sake, have one bout with you;\n"+
		"he cannot by the duello avoid it: but he has\n"+
		"promised me, as he is a gentleman and a soldier, he\n"+
		"will not hurt you. Come on; to't.\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"Pray God, he keep his oath!\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"I do assure you, 'tis against my will.\n"+
		"They draw\n"+
		"Enter ANTONIO\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Put up your sword. If this young gentleman\n"+
		"Have done offence, I take the fault on me:\n"+
		"If you offend him, I for him defy you.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"You, sir! why, what are you?\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"One, sir, that for his love dares yet do more\n"+
		"Than you have heard him brag to you he will.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Nay, if you be an undertaker, I am for you.\n"+
		"They draw\n"+
		"Enter Officers\n"+
		"FABIAN\n"+
		"O good Sir Toby, hold! here come the officers.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"I'll be with you anon.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"Pray, sir, put your sword up, if you please.\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"Marry, will I, sir; and, for that I promised you,\n"+
		"I'll be as good as my word: he will bear you easily\n"+
		"and reins well.\n"+
		"First Officer\n"+
		"This is the man; do thy office.\n"+
		"Second Officer\n"+
		"Antonio, I arrest thee at the suit of Count Orsino.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"You do mistake me, sir.\n"+
		"First Officer\n"+
		"No, sir, no jot; I know your favour well,\n"+
		"Though now you have no sea-cap on your head.\n"+
		"Take him away: he knows I know him well.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"I must obey.\n"+
		"To VIOLA\n"+
		"This comes with seeking you:\n"+
		"But there's no remedy; I shall answer it.\n"+
		"What will you do, now my necessity\n"+
		"Makes me to ask you for my purse? It grieves me\n"+
		"Much more for what I cannot do for you\n"+
		"Than what befalls myself. You stand amazed;\n"+
		"But be of comfort.\n"+
		"Second Officer\n"+
		"Come, sir, away.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"I must entreat of you some of that money.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"What money, sir?\n"+
		"For the fair kindness you have show'd me here,\n"+
		"And, part, being prompted by your present trouble,\n"+
		"Out of my lean and low ability\n"+
		"I'll lend you something: my having is not much;\n"+
		"I'll make division of my present with you:\n"+
		"Hold, there's half my coffer.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Will you deny me now?\n"+
		"Is't possible that my deserts to you\n"+
		"Can lack persuasion? Do not tempt my misery,\n"+
		"Lest that it make me so unsound a man\n"+
		"As to upbraid you with those kindnesses\n"+
		"That I have done for you.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"I know of none;\n"+
		"Nor know I you by voice or any feature:\n"+
		"I hate ingratitude more in a man\n"+
		"Than lying, vainness, babbling, drunkenness,\n"+
		"Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption\n"+
		"Inhabits our frail blood.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"O heavens themselves!\n"+
		"Second Officer\n"+
		"Come, sir, I pray you, go.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Let me speak a little. This youth that you see here\n"+
		"I snatch'd one half out of the jaws of death,\n"+
		"Relieved him with such sanctity of love,\n"+
		"And to his image, which methought did promise\n"+
		"Most venerable worth, did I devotion.\n"+
		"First Officer\n"+
		"What's that to us? The time goes by: away!\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"But O how vile an idol proves this god\n"+
		"Thou hast, Sebastian, done good feature shame.\n"+
		"In nature there's no blemish but the mind;\n"+
		"None can be call'd deform'd but the unkind:\n"+
		"Virtue is beauty, but the beauteous evil\n"+
		"Are empty trunks o'erflourish'd by the devil.\n"+
		"First Officer\n"+
		"The man grows mad: away with him! Come, come, sir.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Lead me on.\n"+
		"Exit with Officers\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"Methinks his words do from such passion fly,\n"+
		"That he believes himself: so do not I.\n"+
		"Prove true, imagination, O, prove true,\n"+
		"That I, dear brother, be now ta'en for you!\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Come hither, knight; come hither, Fabian: we'll\n"+
		"whisper o'er a couplet or two of most sage saws.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"He named Sebastian: I my brother know\n"+
		"Yet living in my glass; even such and so\n"+
		"In favour was my brother, and he went\n"+
		"Still in this fashion, colour, ornament,\n"+
		"For him I imitate: O, if it prove,\n"+
		"Tempests are kind and salt waves fresh in love.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"A very dishonest paltry boy, and more a coward than\n"+
		"a hare: his dishonesty appears in leaving his\n"+
		"friend here in necessity and denying him; and for\n"+
		"his cowardship, ask Fabian.\n"+
		"FABIAN\n"+
		"A coward, a most devout coward, religious in it.\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"'Slid, I'll after him again and beat him.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Do; cuff him soundly, but never draw thy sword.\n"+

		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+

		"Enter SEBASTIAN and Clown\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Will you make me believe that I am not sent for you?\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"Go to, go to, thou art a foolish fellow:\n"+
		"Let me be clear of thee.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Well held out, i' faith! No, I do not know you; nor\n"+
		"I am not sent to you by my lady, to bid you come\n"+
		"speak with her; nor your name is not Master Cesario;\n"+
		"nor this is not my nose neither. Nothing that is so is so.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"I prithee, vent thy folly somewhere else: Thou\n"+
		"know'st not me.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Vent my folly! he has heard that word of some\n"+
		"great man and now applies it to a fool. Vent my\n"+
		"folly! I am afraid this great lubber, the world,\n"+
		"will prove a cockney. I prithee now, ungird thy\n"+
		"strangeness and tell me what I shall vent to my\n"+
		"lady: shall I vent to her that thou art coming?\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"I prithee, foolish Greek, depart from me: There's\n"+
		"money for thee: if you tarry longer, I shall give\n"+
		"worse payment.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"By my troth, thou hast an open hand. These wise men\n"+
		"that give fools money get themselves a good\n"+
		"report--after fourteen years' purchase.\n"+
		"Enter SIR ANDREW, SIR TOBY BELCH, and FABIAN\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"Now, sir, have I met you again? there's for you.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"Why, there's for thee, and there, and there. Are all\n"+
		"the people mad?\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Hold, sir, or I'll throw your dagger o'er the house.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"This will I tell my lady straight: I would not be\n"+
		"in some of your coats for two pence.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Come on, sir; hold.\n"+
		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"Nay, let him alone: I'll go another way to work\n"+
		"with him; I'll have an action of battery against\n"+
		"him, if there be any law in Illyria: though I\n"+
		"struck him first, yet it's no matter for that.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"Let go thy hand.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Come, sir, I will not let you go. Come, my young\n"+
		"soldier, put up your iron: you are well fleshed; come on.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"I will be free from thee. What wouldst thou now? If\n"+
		"thou darest tempt me further, draw thy sword.\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"What, what? Nay, then I must have an ounce or two\n"+
		"of this malapert blood from you.\n"+
		"Enter OLIVIA\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Hold, Toby; on thy life I charge thee, hold!\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Madam!\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Will it be ever thus? Ungracious wretch,\n"+
		"Fit for the mountains and the barbarous caves,\n"+
		"Where manners ne'er were preach'd! out of my sight!\n"+
		"Be not offended, dear Cesario.\n"+
		"Rudesby, be gone!\n"+
		"Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH, SIR ANDREW, and FABIAN\n"+
		"I prithee, gentle friend,\n"+
		"Let thy fair wisdom, not thy passion, sway\n"+
		"In this uncivil and thou unjust extent\n"+
		"Against thy peace. Go with me to my house,\n"+
		"And hear thou there how many fruitless pranks\n"+
		"This ruffian hath botch'd up, that thou thereby\n"+
		"Mayst smile at this: thou shalt not choose but go:\n"+
		"Do not deny. Beshrew his soul for me,\n"+
		"He started one poor heart of mine in thee.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"What relish is in this? how runs the stream?\n"+

		"Clown\n"+
		"Well, I'll put it on, and I will dissemble myself\n"+
		"in't; and I would I were the first that ever\n"+
		"dissembled in such a gown. I am not tall enough to\n"+
		"become the function well, nor lean enough to be\n"+
		"thought a good student; but to be said an honest man\n"+
		"and a good housekeeper goes as fairly as to say a\n"+

		"Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and MARIA\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"Jove bless thee, master Parson.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Bonos dies, Sir Toby: for, as the old hermit of\n"+
		"Prague, that never saw pen and ink, very wittily\n"+
		"said to a niece of King Gorboduc, 'That that is is;'\n"+
		"so I, being Master Parson, am Master Parson; for,\n"+

		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+

		"Sir Topas, never was man thus wronged: good Sir\n"+

		"Clown\n"+
		"Fie, thou dishonest Satan! I call thee by the most\n"+
		"modest terms; for I am one of those gentle ones\n"+
		"that will use the devil himself with courtesy:\n"+
		"sayest thou that house is dark?\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"As hell, Sir Topas.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Why it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes,\n"+
		"and the clearstores toward the south north are as\n"+
		"lustrous as ebony; and yet complainest thou of\n"+
		"obstruction?\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"I am not mad, Sir Topas: I say to you, this house is dark.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Madman, thou errest: I say, there is no darkness\n"+
		"but ignorance; in which thou art more puzzled than\n"+
		"the Egyptians in their fog.\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"I say, this house is as dark as ignorance, though\n"+
		"ignorance were as dark as hell; and I say, there\n"+
		"was never man thus abused. I am no more mad than you\n"+
		"are: make the trial of it in any constant question.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"What is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning wild fowl?\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"That the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a bird.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"What thinkest thou of his opinion?\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"I think nobly of the soul, and no way approve his opinion.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Fare thee well. Remain thou still in darkness:\n"+
		"thou shalt hold the opinion of Pythagoras ere I will\n"+
		"allow of thy wits, and fear to kill a woodcock, lest\n"+

		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"To him in thine own voice, and bring me word how\n"+
		"thou findest him: I would we were well rid of this\n"+
		"knavery. If he may be conveniently delivered, I\n"+
		"would he were, for I am now so far in offence with\n"+
		"my niece that I cannot pursue with any safety this\n"+

		"Fool, there was never a man so notoriously abused: I\n"+

		"Clown\n"+
		"But as well? then you are mad indeed, if you be no\n"+

		"Clown\n"+

		"Yet there he was; and there I found this credit,\n"+
		"That he did range the town to seek me out.\n"+
		"His counsel now might do me golden service;\n"+
		"For though my soul disputes well with my sense,\n"+
		"That this may be some error, but no madness,\n"+

		"Just the contrary; the better for thy friends.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"No, sir, the worse.\n"+
		"DUKE ORSINO\n"+
		"How can that be?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Marry, sir, they praise me and make an ass of me;\n"+
		"now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass: so that by\n"+
		"my foes, sir I profit in the knowledge of myself,\n"+
		"and by my friends, I am abused: so that,\n"+
		"conclusions to be as kisses, if your four negatives\n"+
		"make your two affirmatives why then, the worse for\n"+
		"my friends and the better for my foes.\n"+
		"DUKE ORSINO\n"+

		"DUKE ORSINO\n"+
		"You can fool no more money out of me at this throw:\n"+

		"Marry, sir, lullaby to your bounty till I come\n"+

		"For shallow draught and bulk unprizable;\n"+
		"With which such scathful grapple did he make\n"+

		"That very envy and the tongue of loss\n"+
		"Cried fame and honour on him. What's the matter?\n"+
		"First Officer\n"+
		"Orsino, this is that Antonio\n"+
		"That took the Phoenix and her fraught from Candy;\n"+
		"And this is he that did the Tiger board,\n"+
		"When your young nephew Titus lost his leg:\n"+
		"Here in the streets, desperate of shame and state,\n"+
		"In private brabble did we apprehend him.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"He did me kindness, sir, drew on my side;\n"+
		"But in conclusion put strange speech upon me:\n"+
		"I know not what 'twas but distraction.\n"+
		"DUKE ORSINO\n"+
		"Notable pirate! thou salt-water thief!\n"+
		"What foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies,\n"+
		"Whom thou, in terms so bloody and so dear,\n"+

		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Orsino, noble sir,\n"+
		"Be pleased that I shake off these names you give me:\n"+
		"Antonio never yet was thief or pirate,\n"+
		"Though I confess, on base and ground enough,\n"+
		"Orsino's enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither:\n"+
		"That most ingrateful boy there by your side,\n"+
		"From the rude sea's enraged and foamy mouth\n"+
		"Did I redeem; a wreck past hope he was:\n"+
		"His life I gave him and did thereto add\n"+
		"My love, without retention or restraint,\n"+
		"All his in dedication; for his sake\n"+
		"Did I expose myself, pure for his love,\n"+
		"Into the danger of this adverse town;\n"+
		"Drew to defend him when he was beset:\n"+
		"Where being apprehended, his false cunning,\n"+
		"Not meaning to partake with me in danger,\n"+
		"Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance,\n"+
		"And grew a twenty years removed thing\n"+
		"While one would wink; denied me mine own purse,\n"+
		"Which I had recommended to his use\n"+
		"Not half an hour before.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"How can this be?\n"+
		"DUKE ORSINO\n"+
		"When came he to this town?\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"To-day, my lord; and for three months before,\n"+
		"No interim, not a minute's vacancy,\n"+
		"Both day and night did we keep company.\n"+
		"Enter OLIVIA and Attendants\n"+
		"DUKE ORSINO\n"+
		"Here comes the countess: now heaven walks on earth.\n"+
		"But for thee, fellow; fellow, thy words are madness:\n"+
		"Three months this youth hath tended upon me;\n"+
		"But more of that anon. Take him aside.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"What would my lord, but that he may not have,\n"+
		"Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable?\n"+

		"VIOLA\n"+
		"My lord would speak; my duty hushes me.\n"+

		"If it be aught to the old tune, my lord,\n"+

		"Still so cruel?\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Still so constant, lord.\n"+
		"DUKE ORSINO\n"+
		"What, to perverseness? you uncivil lady,\n"+
		"To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars\n"+
		"My soul the faithfull'st offerings hath breathed out\n"+
		"That e'er devotion tender'd! What shall I do?\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Even what it please my lord, that shall become him.\n"+
		"DUKE ORSINO\n"+
		"Why should I not, had I the heart to do it,\n"+
		"Like to the Egyptian thief at point of death,\n"+
		"Kill what I love?--a savage jealousy\n"+
		"That sometimes savours nobly. But hear me this:\n"+
		"Since you to non-regardance cast my faith,\n"+
		"And that I partly know the instrument\n"+
		"That screws me from my true place in your favour,\n"+
		"Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still;\n"+
		"But this your minion, whom I know you love,\n"+
		"And whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly,\n"+
		"Him will I tear out of that cruel eye,\n"+
		"Where he sits crowned in his master's spite.\n"+
		"Come, boy, with me; my thoughts are ripe in mischief:\n"+

		"After him I love\n"+

		"Her husband, sirrah!\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"No, my lord, not I.\n"+

		"Fear not, Cesario; take thy fortunes up;\n"+

		"As great as that thou fear'st.\n"+

		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"He has broke my head across and has given Sir Toby\n"+

		"You drew your sword upon me without cause;\n"+

		"SIR ANDREW\n"+
		"If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt, you have hurt me: I\n"+
		"think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb.\n"+
		"Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and Clown\n"+

		"How now, gentleman! how is't with you?\n"+
		"SIR TOBY BELCH\n"+
		"That's all one: has hurt me, and there's the end\n"+

		"Clown\n"+
		"O, he's drunk, Sir Toby, an hour agone; his eyes\n"+
		"were set at eight i' the morning.\n"+

		"Do I stand there? I never had a brother;\n"+
		"Nor can there be that deity in my nature,\n"+
		"Of here and every where. I had a sister,\n"+
		"Whom the blind waves and surges have devour'd.\n"+
		"Of charity, what kin are you to me?\n"+
		"What countryman? what name? what parentage?\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"Of Messaline: Sebastian was my father;\n"+
		"Such a Sebastian was my brother too,\n"+
		"So went he suited to his watery tomb:\n"+
		"If spirits can assume both form and suit\n"+
		"You come to fright us.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"A spirit I am indeed;\n"+
		"But am in that dimension grossly clad\n"+
		"Which from the womb I did participate.\n"+
		"Were you a woman, as the rest goes even,\n"+
		"I should my tears let fall upon your cheek,\n"+
		"And say 'Thrice-welcome, drowned Viola!'\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"My father had a mole upon his brow.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"And so had mine.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"And died that day when Viola from her birth\n"+
		"Had number'd thirteen years.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"O, that record is lively in my soul!\n"+
		"He finished indeed his mortal act\n"+
		"That day that made my sister thirteen years.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"If nothing lets to make us happy both\n"+
		"But this my masculine usurp'd attire,\n"+
		"Do not embrace me till each circumstance\n"+
		"Of place, time, fortune, do cohere and jump\n"+
		"That I am Viola: which to confirm,\n"+
		"I'll bring you to a captain in this town,\n"+
		"Where lie my maiden weeds; by whose gentle help\n"+
		"I was preserved to serve this noble count.\n"+
		"All the occurrence of my fortune since\n"+
		"Hath been between this lady and this lord.\n"+
		"SEBASTIAN\n"+
		"[To OLIVIA] So comes it, lady, you have been mistook:\n"+
		"But nature to her bias drew in that.\n"+
		"You would have been contracted to a maid;\n"+
		"Nor are you therein, by my life, deceived,\n"+
		"You are betroth'd both to a maid and man.\n"+
		"DUKE ORSINO\n"+
		"Be not amazed; right noble is his blood.\n"+
		"If this be so, as yet the glass seems true,\n"+
		"I shall have share in this most happy wreck.\n"+
		"To VIOLA\n"+
		"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times\n"+
		"Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"And all those sayings will I overswear;\n"+
		"And those swearings keep as true in soul\n"+
		"As doth that orbed continent the fire\n"+
		"That severs day from night.\n"+
		"DUKE ORSINO\n"+
		"Give me thy hand;\n"+
		"And let me see thee in thy woman's weeds.\n"+
		"VIOLA\n"+
		"The captain that did bring me first on shore\n"+
		"Hath my maid's garments: he upon some action\n"+
		"Is now in durance, at Malvolio's suit,\n"+
		"A gentleman, and follower of my lady's.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"He shall enlarge him: fetch Malvolio hither:\n"+
		"And yet, alas, now I remember me,\n"+
		"They say, poor gentleman, he's much distract.\n"+
		"Re-enter Clown with a letter, and FABIAN\n"+
		"A most extracting frenzy of mine own\n"+
		"From my remembrance clearly banish'd his.\n"+
		"How does he, sirrah?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Truly, madam, he holds Belzebub at the staves's end as\n"+
		"well as a man in his case may do: has here writ a\n"+
		"letter to you; I should have given't you to-day\n"+
		"morning, but as a madman's epistles are no gospels,\n"+
		"so it skills not much when they are delivered.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Open't, and read it.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Look then to be well edified when the fool delivers\n"+
		"the madman.\n"+
		"Reads\n"+
		"'By the Lord, madam,'--\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"How now! art thou mad?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"No, madam, I do but read madness: an your ladyship\n"+
		"will have it as it ought to be, you must allow Vox.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Prithee, read i' thy right wits.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"So I do, madonna; but to read his right wits is to\n"+
		"read thus: therefore perpend, my princess, and give ear.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Read it you, sirrah.\n"+
		"To FABIAN\n"+
		"FABIAN\n"+
		"[Reads] 'By the Lord, madam, you wrong me, and the\n"+
		"world shall know it: though you have put me into\n"+
		"darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over\n"+
		"me, yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as\n"+
		"your ladyship. I have your own letter that induced\n"+
		"me to the semblance I put on; with the which I doubt\n"+
		"not but to do myself much right, or you much shame.\n"+
		"Think of me as you please. I leave my duty a little\n"+
		"unthought of and speak out of my injury.\n"+
		"THE MADLY-USED MALVOLIO.'\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Did he write this?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Ay, madam.\n"+
		"DUKE ORSINO\n"+
		"This savours not much of distraction.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"See him deliver'd, Fabian; bring him hither.\n"+
		"Exit FABIAN\n"+
		"My lord so please you, these things further\n"+
		"thought on,\n"+
		"To think me as well a sister as a wife,\n"+
		"One day shall crown the alliance on't, so please you,\n"+
		"Here at my house and at my proper cost.\n"+
		"DUKE ORSINO\n"+
		"Madam, I am most apt to embrace your offer.\n"+
		"To VIOLA\n"+
		"Your master quits you; and for your service done him,\n"+
		"So much against the mettle of your sex,\n"+
		"So far beneath your soft and tender breeding,\n"+
		"And since you call'd me master for so long,\n"+
		"Here is my hand: you shall from this time be\n"+
		"Your master's mistress.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"A sister! you are she.\n"+
		"Re-enter FABIAN, with MALVOLIO\n"+
		"DUKE ORSINO\n"+
		"Is this the madman?\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Ay, my lord, this same.\n"+
		"How now, Malvolio!\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"Madam, you have done me wrong,\n"+
		"Notorious wrong.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Have I, Malvolio? no.\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"Lady, you have. Pray you, peruse that letter.\n"+
		"You must not now deny it is your hand:\n"+
		"Write from it, if you can, in hand or phrase;\n"+
		"Or say 'tis not your seal, nor your invention:\n"+
		"You can say none of this: well, grant it then\n"+
		"And tell me, in the modesty of honour,\n"+
		"Why you have given me such clear lights of favour,\n"+
		"Bade me come smiling and cross-garter'd to you,\n"+
		"To put on yellow stockings and to frown\n"+
		"Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people;\n"+
		"And, acting this in an obedient hope,\n"+
		"Why have you suffer'd me to be imprison'd,\n"+
		"Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest,\n"+
		"And made the most notorious geck and gull\n"+
		"That e'er invention play'd on? tell me why.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing,\n"+
		"Though, I confess, much like the character\n"+
		"But out of question 'tis Maria's hand.\n"+
		"And now I do bethink me, it was she\n"+
		"First told me thou wast mad; then camest in smiling,\n"+
		"And in such forms which here were presupposed\n"+
		"Upon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content:\n"+
		"This practise hath most shrewdly pass'd upon thee;\n"+
		"But when we know the grounds and authors of it,\n"+
		"Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge\n"+
		"Of thine own cause.\n"+
		"FABIAN\n"+
		"Good madam, hear me speak,\n"+
		"And let no quarrel nor no brawl to come\n"+
		"Taint the condition of this present hour,\n"+
		"Which I have wonder'd at. In hope it shall not,\n"+
		"Most freely I confess, myself and Toby\n"+
		"Set this device against Malvolio here,\n"+
		"Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts\n"+
		"We had conceived against him: Maria writ\n"+
		"The letter at Sir Toby's great importance;\n"+
		"In recompense whereof he hath married her.\n"+
		"How with a sportful malice it was follow'd,\n"+
		"May rather pluck on laughter than revenge;\n"+
		"If that the injuries be justly weigh'd\n"+
		"That have on both sides pass'd.\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"Alas, poor fool, how have they baffled thee!\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Why, 'some are born great, some achieve greatness,\n"+
		"and some have greatness thrown upon them.' I was\n"+
		"one, sir, in this interlude; one Sir Topas, sir; but\n"+
		"that's all one. 'By the Lord, fool, I am not mad.'\n"+
		"But do you remember? 'Madam, why laugh you at such\n"+
		"a barren rascal? an you smile not, he's gagged:'\n"+
		"and thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges.\n"+
		"MALVOLIO\n"+
		"I'll be revenged on the whole pack of you.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"OLIVIA\n"+
		"He hath been most notoriously abused.\n"+
		"DUKE ORSINO\n"+
		"Pursue him and entreat him to a peace:\n"+
		"He hath not told us of the captain yet:\n"+
		"When that is known and golden time convents,\n"+
		"A solemn combination shall be made\n"+
		"Of our dear souls. Meantime, sweet sister,\n"+
		"We will not part from hence. Cesario, come;\n"+
		"For so you shall be, while you are a man;\n"+
		"But when in other habits you are seen,\n"+
		"Orsino's mistress and his fancy's queen.\n"+
		"Exeunt all, except Clown\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"[Sings]\n"+
		"When that I was and a little tiny boy,\n"+
		"With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,\n"+
		"A foolish thing was but a toy,\n"+
		"For the rain it raineth every day.\n"+
		"But when I came to man's estate,\n"+
		"With hey, ho, & c.\n"+
		"'Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate,\n"+
		"For the rain, & c.\n"+
		"But when I came, alas! to wive,\n"+
		"With hey, ho, & c.\n"+
		"By swaggering could I never thrive,\n"+
		"For the rain, & c.\n"+
		"But when I came unto my beds,\n"+
		"With hey, ho, & c.\n"+
		"With toss-pots still had drunken heads,\n"+
		"For the rain, & c.\n"+
		"A great while ago the world begun,\n"+
		"With hey, ho, & c.\n"+
