		"The Merchant of Venice\n"+
		"ACT I\n"+
		"SCENE I. Venice. A street.\n"+
		"Enter ANTONIO, SALARINO, and SALANIO\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:\n"+
		"It wearies me; you say it wearies you;\n"+
		"But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,\n"+
		"What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,\n"+
		"I am to learn;\n"+
		"And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,\n"+
		"That I have much ado to know myself.\n"+
		"SALARINO\n"+
		"Your mind is tossing on the ocean;\n"+
		"There, where your argosies with portly sail,\n"+
		"Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,\n"+
		"Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,\n"+
		"Do overpeer the petty traffickers,\n"+
		"That curtsy to them, do them reverence,\n"+
		"As they fly by them with their woven wings.\n"+
		"SALANIO\n"+
		"Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,\n"+
		"The better part of my affections would\n"+
		"Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still\n"+
		"Plucking the grass, to know where sits the wind,\n"+
		"Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads;\n"+
		"And every object that might make me fear\n"+
		"Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt\n"+
		"Would make me sad.\n"+
		"SALARINO\n"+
		"My wind cooling my broth\n"+
		"Would blow me to an ague, when I thought\n"+
		"What harm a wind too great at sea might do.\n"+
		"I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,\n"+
		"But I should think of shallows and of flats,\n"+
		"And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand,\n"+
		"Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs\n"+
		"To kiss her burial. Should I go to church\n"+
		"And see the holy edifice of stone,\n"+
		"And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,\n"+
		"Which touching but my gentle vessel's side,\n"+
		"Would scatter all her spices on the stream,\n"+
		"Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,\n"+
		"And, in a word, but even now worth this,\n"+
		"And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought\n"+
		"To think on this, and shall I lack the thought\n"+
		"That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?\n"+
		"But tell not me; I know, Antonio\n"+
		"Is sad to think upon his merchandise.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it,\n"+
		"My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,\n"+
		"Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate\n"+
		"Upon the fortune of this present year:\n"+
		"Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.\n"+
		"SALARINO\n"+
		"Why, then you are in love.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Fie, fie!\n"+
		"SALARINO\n"+
		"Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad,\n"+
		"Because you are not merry: and 'twere as easy\n"+
		"For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry,\n"+
		"Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,\n"+
		"Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time:\n"+
		"Some that will evermore peep through their eyes\n"+
		"And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper,\n"+
		"And other of such vinegar aspect\n"+
		"That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile,\n"+
		"Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.\n"+
		"Enter BASSANIO, LORENZO, and GRATIANO\n"+
		"SALANIO\n"+
		"Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,\n"+
		"Gratiano and Lorenzo. Fare ye well:\n"+
		"We leave you now with better company.\n"+
		"SALARINO\n"+
		"I would have stay'd till I had made you merry,\n"+
		"If worthier friends had not prevented me.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Your worth is very dear in my regard.\n"+
		"I take it, your own business calls on you\n"+
		"And you embrace the occasion to depart.\n"+
		"SALARINO\n"+
		"Good morrow, my good lords.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? say, when?\n"+
		"You grow exceeding strange: must it be so?\n"+
		"SALARINO\n"+
		"We'll make our leisures to attend on yours.\n"+
		"Exeunt Salarino and Salanio\n"+
		"LORENZO\n"+
		"My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,\n"+
		"We two will leave you: but at dinner-time,\n"+
		"I pray you, have in mind where we must meet.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"I will not fail you.\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"You look not well, Signior Antonio;\n"+
		"You have too much respect upon the world:\n"+
		"They lose it that do buy it with much care:\n"+
		"Believe me, you are marvellously changed.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano;\n"+
		"A stage where every man must play a part,\n"+
		"And mine a sad one.\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"Let me play the fool:\n"+
		"With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,\n"+
		"And let my liver rather heat with wine\n"+
		"Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.\n"+
		"Why should a man, whose blood is warm within,\n"+
		"Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?\n"+
		"Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice\n"+
		"By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio--\n"+
		"I love thee, and it is my love that speaks--\n"+
		"There are a sort of men whose visages\n"+
		"Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,\n"+
		"And do a wilful stillness entertain,\n"+
		"With purpose to be dress'd in an opinion\n"+
		"Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,\n"+
		"As who should say 'I am Sir Oracle,\n"+
		"And when I ope my lips let no dog bark!'\n"+
		"O my Antonio, I do know of these\n"+
		"That therefore only are reputed wise\n"+
		"For saying nothing; when, I am very sure,\n"+
		"If they should speak, would almost damn those ears,\n"+
		"Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.\n"+
		"I'll tell thee more of this another time:\n"+
		"But fish not, with this melancholy bait,\n"+
		"For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.\n"+
		"Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile:\n"+
		"I'll end my exhortation after dinner.\n"+
		"LORENZO\n"+
		"Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time:\n"+
		"I must be one of these same dumb wise men,\n"+
		"For Gratiano never lets me speak.\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"Well, keep me company but two years moe,\n"+
		"Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Farewell: I'll grow a talker for this gear.\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"Thanks, i' faith, for silence is only commendable\n"+
		"In a neat's tongue dried and a maid not vendible.\n"+
		"Exeunt GRATIANO and LORENZO\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Is that any thing now?\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more\n"+
		"than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two\n"+
		"grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you\n"+
		"shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you\n"+
		"have them, they are not worth the search.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Well, tell me now what lady is the same\n"+
		"To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,\n"+
		"That you to-day promised to tell me of?\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,\n"+
		"How much I have disabled mine estate,\n"+
		"By something showing a more swelling port\n"+
		"Than my faint means would grant continuance:\n"+
		"Nor do I now make moan to be abridged\n"+
		"From such a noble rate; but my chief care\n"+
		"Is to come fairly off from the great debts\n"+
		"Wherein my time something too prodigal\n"+
		"Hath left me gaged. To you, Antonio,\n"+
		"I owe the most, in money and in love,\n"+
		"And from your love I have a warranty\n"+
		"To unburden all my plots and purposes\n"+
		"How to get clear of all the debts I owe.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;\n"+
		"And if it stand, as you yourself still do,\n"+
		"Within the eye of honour, be assured,\n"+
		"My purse, my person, my extremest means,\n"+
		"Lie all unlock'd to your occasions.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,\n"+
		"I shot his fellow of the self-same flight\n"+
		"The self-same way with more advised watch,\n"+
		"To find the other forth, and by adventuring both\n"+
		"I oft found both: I urge this childhood proof,\n"+
		"Because what follows is pure innocence.\n"+
		"I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,\n"+
		"That which I owe is lost; but if you please\n"+
		"To shoot another arrow that self way\n"+
		"Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,\n"+
		"As I will watch the aim, or to find both\n"+
		"Or bring your latter hazard back again\n"+
		"And thankfully rest debtor for the first.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"You know me well, and herein spend but time\n"+
		"To wind about my love with circumstance;\n"+
		"And out of doubt you do me now more wrong\n"+
		"In making question of my uttermost\n"+
		"Than if you had made waste of all I have:\n"+
		"Then do but say to me what I should do\n"+
		"That in your knowledge may by me be done,\n"+
		"And I am prest unto it: therefore, speak.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"In Belmont is a lady richly left;\n"+
		"And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,\n"+
		"Of wondrous virtues: sometimes from her eyes\n"+
		"I did receive fair speechless messages:\n"+
		"Her name is Portia, nothing undervalued\n"+
		"To Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia:\n"+
		"Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,\n"+
		"For the four winds blow in from every coast\n"+
		"Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks\n"+
		"Hang on her temples like a golden fleece;\n"+
		"Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos' strand,\n"+
		"And many Jasons come in quest of her.\n"+
		"O my Antonio, had I but the means\n"+
		"To hold a rival place with one of them,\n"+
		"I have a mind presages me such thrift,\n"+
		"That I should questionless be fortunate!\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea;\n"+
		"Neither have I money nor commodity\n"+
		"To raise a present sum: therefore go forth;\n"+
		"Try what my credit can in Venice do:\n"+
		"That shall be rack'd, even to the uttermost,\n"+
		"To furnish thee to Belmont, to fair Portia.\n"+
		"Go, presently inquire, and so will I,\n"+
		"Where money is, and I no question make\n"+
		"To have it of my trust or for my sake.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II: Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.\n"+
		"Enter PORTIA and NERISSA\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of\n"+
		"this great world.\n"+
		"NERISSA\n"+
		"You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in\n"+
		"the same abundance as your good fortunes are: and\n"+
		"yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit\n"+
		"with too much as they that starve with nothing. It\n"+
		"is no mean happiness therefore, to be seated in the\n"+
		"mean: superfluity comes sooner by white hairs, but\n"+
		"competency lives longer.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Good sentences and well pronounced.\n"+
		"NERISSA\n"+
		"They would be better, if well followed.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"If to do were as easy as to know what were good to\n"+
		"do, chapels had been churches and poor men's\n"+
		"cottages princes' palaces. It is a good divine that\n"+
		"follows his own instructions: I can easier teach\n"+
		"twenty what were good to be done, than be one of the\n"+
		"twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may\n"+
		"devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps\n"+
		"o'er a cold decree: such a hare is madness the\n"+
		"youth, to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the\n"+
		"cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to\n"+
		"choose me a husband. O me, the word 'choose!' I may\n"+
		"neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I\n"+
		"dislike; so is the will of a living daughter curbed\n"+
		"by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard,\n"+
		"Nerissa, that I cannot choose one nor refuse none?\n"+
		"NERISSA\n"+
		"Your father was ever virtuous; and holy men at their\n"+
		"death have good inspirations: therefore the lottery,\n"+
		"that he hath devised in these three chests of gold,\n"+
		"silver and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning\n"+
		"chooses you, will, no doubt, never be chosen by any\n"+
		"rightly but one who shall rightly love. But what\n"+
		"warmth is there in your affection towards any of\n"+
		"these princely suitors that are already come?\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"I pray thee, over-name them; and as thou namest\n"+
		"them, I will describe them; and, according to my\n"+
		"description, level at my affection.\n"+
		"NERISSA\n"+
		"First, there is the Neapolitan prince.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Ay, that's a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but\n"+
		"talk of his horse; and he makes it a great\n"+
		"appropriation to his own good parts, that he can\n"+
		"shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his\n"+
		"mother played false with a smith.\n"+
		"NERISSA\n"+
		"Then there is the County Palatine.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"He doth nothing but frown, as who should say 'If you\n"+
		"will not have me, choose:' he hears merry tales and\n"+
		"smiles not: I fear he will prove the weeping\n"+
		"philosopher when he grows old, being so full of\n"+
		"unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be\n"+
		"married to a death's-head with a bone in his mouth\n"+
		"than to either of these. God defend me from these\n"+
		"two!\n"+
		"NERISSA\n"+
		"How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man.\n"+
		"In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker: but,\n"+
		"he! why, he hath a horse better than the\n"+
		"Neapolitan's, a better bad habit of frowning than\n"+
		"the Count Palatine; he is every man in no man; if a\n"+
		"throstle sing, he falls straight a capering: he will\n"+
		"fence with his own shadow: if I should marry him, I\n"+
		"should marry twenty husbands. If he would despise me\n"+
		"I would forgive him, for if he love me to madness, I\n"+
		"shall never requite him.\n"+
		"NERISSA\n"+
		"What say you, then, to Falconbridge, the young baron\n"+
		"of England?\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"You know I say nothing to him, for he understands\n"+
		"not me, nor I him: he hath neither Latin, French,\n"+
		"nor Italian, and you will come into the court and\n"+
		"swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English.\n"+
		"He is a proper man's picture, but, alas, who can\n"+
		"converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited!\n"+
		"I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round\n"+
		"hose in France, his bonnet in Germany and his\n"+
		"behavior every where.\n"+
		"NERISSA\n"+
		"What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he\n"+
		"borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman and\n"+
		"swore he would pay him again when he was able: I\n"+
		"think the Frenchman became his surety and sealed\n"+
		"under for another.\n"+
		"NERISSA\n"+
		"How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's nephew?\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Very vilely in the morning, when he is sober, and\n"+
		"most vilely in the afternoon, when he is drunk: when\n"+
		"he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and\n"+
		"when he is worst, he is little better than a beast:\n"+
		"and the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall\n"+
		"make shift to go without him.\n"+
		"NERISSA\n"+
		"If he should offer to choose, and choose the right\n"+
		"casket, you should refuse to perform your father's\n"+
		"will, if you should refuse to accept him.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee, set a\n"+
		"deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket,\n"+
		"for if the devil be within and that temptation\n"+
		"without, I know he will choose it. I will do any\n"+
		"thing, Nerissa, ere I'll be married to a sponge.\n"+
		"NERISSA\n"+
		"You need not fear, lady, the having any of these\n"+
		"lords: they have acquainted me with their\n"+
		"determinations; which is, indeed, to return to their\n"+
		"home and to trouble you with no more suit, unless\n"+
		"you may be won by some other sort than your father's\n"+
		"imposition depending on the caskets.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as\n"+
		"chaste as Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner\n"+
		"of my father's will. I am glad this parcel of wooers\n"+
		"are so reasonable, for there is not one among them\n"+
		"but I dote on his very absence, and I pray God grant\n"+
		"them a fair departure.\n"+
		"NERISSA\n"+
		"Do you not remember, lady, in your father's time, a\n"+
		"Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither\n"+
		"in company of the Marquis of Montferrat?\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Yes, yes, it was Bassanio; as I think, he was so called.\n"+
		"NERISSA\n"+
		"True, madam: he, of all the men that ever my foolish\n"+
		"eyes looked upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of\n"+
		"thy praise.\n"+
		"Enter a Serving-man\n"+
		"How now! what news?\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take\n"+
		"their leave: and there is a forerunner come from a\n"+
		"fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the\n"+
		"prince his master will be here to-night.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a\n"+
		"heart as I can bid the other four farewell, I should\n"+
		"be glad of his approach: if he have the condition\n"+
		"of a saint and the complexion of a devil, I had\n"+
		"rather he should shrive me than wive me. Come,\n"+
		"Nerissa. Sirrah, go before.\n"+
		"Whiles we shut the gates\n"+
		"upon one wooer, another knocks at the door.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. Venice. A public place.\n"+
		"Enter BASSANIO and SHYLOCK\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"Three thousand ducats; well.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"Ay, sir, for three months.\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"For three months; well.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"Antonio shall become bound; well.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"May you stead me? will you pleasure me? shall I\n"+
		"know your answer?\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"Three thousand ducats for three months and Antonio bound.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"Your answer to that.\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"Antonio is a good man.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"Oh, no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is a\n"+
		"good man is to have you understand me that he is\n"+
		"sufficient. Yet his means are in supposition: he\n"+
		"hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the\n"+
		"Indies; I understand moreover, upon the Rialto, he\n"+
		"hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and\n"+
		"other ventures he hath, squandered abroad. But ships\n"+
		"are but boards, sailors but men: there be land-rats\n"+
		"and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves, I\n"+
		"mean pirates, and then there is the peril of waters,\n"+
		"winds and rocks. The man is, notwithstanding,\n"+
		"sufficient. Three thousand ducats; I think I may\n"+
		"take his bond.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"Be assured you may.\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"I will be assured I may; and, that I may be assured,\n"+
		"I will bethink me. May I speak with Antonio?\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"If it please you to dine with us.\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"Yes, to smell pork; to eat of the habitation which\n"+
		"your prophet the Nazarite conjured the devil into. I\n"+
		"will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you,\n"+
		"walk with you, and so following, but I will not eat\n"+
		"with you, drink with you, nor pray with you. What\n"+
		"news on the Rialto? Who is he comes here?\n"+
		"Enter ANTONIO\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"This is Signior Antonio.\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"[Aside] How like a fawning publican he looks!\n"+
		"I hate him for he is a Christian,\n"+
		"But more for that in low simplicity\n"+
		"He lends out money gratis and brings down\n"+
		"The rate of usance here with us in Venice.\n"+
		"If I can catch him once upon the hip,\n"+
		"I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.\n"+
		"He hates our sacred nation, and he rails,\n"+
		"Even there where merchants most do congregate,\n"+
		"On me, my bargains and my well-won thrift,\n"+
		"Which he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe,\n"+
		"If I forgive him!\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"Shylock, do you hear?\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"I am debating of my present store,\n"+
		"And, by the near guess of my memory,\n"+
		"I cannot instantly raise up the gross\n"+
		"Of full three thousand ducats. What of that?\n"+
		"Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,\n"+
		"Will furnish me. But soft! how many months\n"+
		"Do you desire?\n"+
		"To ANTONIO\n"+
		"Rest you fair, good signior;\n"+
		"Your worship was the last man in our mouths.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Shylock, although I neither lend nor borrow\n"+
		"By taking nor by giving of excess,\n"+
		"Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend,\n"+
		"I'll break a custom. Is he yet possess'd\n"+
		"How much ye would?\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"And for three months.\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"I had forgot; three months; you told me so.\n"+
		"Well then, your bond; and let me see; but hear you;\n"+
		"Methought you said you neither lend nor borrow\n"+
		"Upon advantage.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"I do never use it.\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"When Jacob grazed his uncle Laban's sheep--\n"+
		"This Jacob from our holy Abram was,\n"+
		"As his wise mother wrought in his behalf,\n"+
		"The third possessor; ay, he was the third--\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"And what of him? did he take interest?\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"No, not take interest, not, as you would say,\n"+
		"Directly interest: mark what Jacob did.\n"+
		"When Laban and himself were compromised\n"+
		"That all the eanlings which were streak'd and pied\n"+
		"Should fall as Jacob's hire, the ewes, being rank,\n"+
		"In the end of autumn turned to the rams,\n"+
		"And, when the work of generation was\n"+
		"Between these woolly breeders in the act,\n"+
		"The skilful shepherd peel'd me certain wands,\n"+
		"And, in the doing of the deed of kind,\n"+
		"He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,\n"+
		"Who then conceiving did in eaning time\n"+
		"Fall parti-colour'd lambs, and those were Jacob's.\n"+
		"This was a way to thrive, and he was blest:\n"+
		"And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"This was a venture, sir, that Jacob served for;\n"+
		"A thing not in his power to bring to pass,\n"+
		"But sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heaven.\n"+
		"Was this inserted to make interest good?\n"+
		"Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast:\n"+
		"But note me, signior.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Mark you this, Bassanio,\n"+
		"The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.\n"+
		"An evil soul producing holy witness\n"+
		"Is like a villain with a smiling cheek,\n"+
		"A goodly apple rotten at the heart:\n"+
		"O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"Three thousand ducats; 'tis a good round sum.\n"+
		"Three months from twelve; then, let me see; the rate--\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"Signior Antonio, many a time and oft\n"+
		"In the Rialto you have rated me\n"+
		"About my moneys and my usances:\n"+
		"Still have I borne it with a patient shrug,\n"+
		"For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe.\n"+
		"You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,\n"+
		"And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine,\n"+
		"And all for use of that which is mine own.\n"+
		"Well then, it now appears you need my help:\n"+
		"Go to, then; you come to me, and you say\n"+
		"'Shylock, we would have moneys:' you say so;\n"+
		"You, that did void your rheum upon my beard\n"+
		"And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur\n"+
		"Over your threshold: moneys is your suit\n"+
		"What should I say to you? Should I not say\n"+
		"'Hath a dog money? is it possible\n"+
		"A cur can lend three thousand ducats?' Or\n"+
		"Shall I bend low and in a bondman's key,\n"+
		"With bated breath and whispering humbleness, Say this;\n"+
		"'Fair sir, you spit on me on Wednesday last;\n"+
		"You spurn'd me such a day; another time\n"+
		"You call'd me dog; and for these courtesies\n"+
		"I'll lend you thus much moneys'?\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"I am as like to call thee so again,\n"+
		"To spit on thee again, to spurn thee too.\n"+
		"If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not\n"+
		"As to thy friends; for when did friendship take\n"+
		"A breed for barren metal of his friend?\n"+
		"But lend it rather to thine enemy,\n"+
		"Who, if he break, thou mayst with better face\n"+
		"Exact the penalty.\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"Why, look you, how you storm!\n"+
		"I would be friends with you and have your love,\n"+
		"Forget the shames that you have stain'd me with,\n"+
		"Supply your present wants and take no doit\n"+
		"Of usance for my moneys, and you'll not hear me:\n"+
		"This is kind I offer.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"This were kindness.\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"This kindness will I show.\n"+
		"Go with me to a notary, seal me there\n"+
		"Your single bond; and, in a merry sport,\n"+
		"If you repay me not on such a day,\n"+
		"In such a place, such sum or sums as are\n"+
		"Express'd in the condition, let the forfeit\n"+
		"Be nominated for an equal pound\n"+
		"Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken\n"+
		"In what part of your body pleaseth me.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Content, i' faith: I'll seal to such a bond\n"+
		"And say there is much kindness in the Jew.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"You shall not seal to such a bond for me:\n"+
		"I'll rather dwell in my necessity.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Why, fear not, man; I will not forfeit it:\n"+
		"Within these two months, that's a month before\n"+
		"This bond expires, I do expect return\n"+
		"Of thrice three times the value of this bond.\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"O father Abram, what these Christians are,\n"+
		"Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect\n"+
		"The thoughts of others! Pray you, tell me this;\n"+
		"If he should break his day, what should I gain\n"+
		"By the exaction of the forfeiture?\n"+
		"A pound of man's flesh taken from a man\n"+
		"Is not so estimable, profitable neither,\n"+
		"As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats. I say,\n"+
		"To buy his favour, I extend this friendship:\n"+
		"If he will take it, so; if not, adieu;\n"+
		"And, for my love, I pray you wrong me not.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Yes Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"Then meet me forthwith at the notary's;\n"+
		"Give him direction for this merry bond,\n"+
		"And I will go and purse the ducats straight,\n"+
		"See to my house, left in the fearful guard\n"+
		"Of an unthrifty knave, and presently\n"+
		"I will be with you.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Hie thee, gentle Jew.\n"+
		"Exit Shylock\n"+
		"The Hebrew will turn Christian: he grows kind.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"I like not fair terms and a villain's mind.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Come on: in this there can be no dismay;\n"+
		"My ships come home a month before the day.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT II\n"+
		"SCENE I. Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.\n"+
		"Flourish of cornets. Enter the PRINCE OF MOROCCO and his train; PORTIA, NERISSA, and others attending\n"+
		"MOROCCO\n"+
		"Mislike me not for my complexion,\n"+
		"The shadow'd livery of the burnish'd sun,\n"+
		"To whom I am a neighbour and near bred.\n"+
		"Bring me the fairest creature northward born,\n"+
		"Where Phoebus' fire scarce thaws the icicles,\n"+
		"And let us make incision for your love,\n"+
		"To prove whose blood is reddest, his or mine.\n"+
		"I tell thee, lady, this aspect of mine\n"+
		"Hath fear'd the valiant: by my love I swear\n"+
		"The best-regarded virgins of our clime\n"+
		"Have loved it too: I would not change this hue,\n"+
		"Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"In terms of choice I am not solely led\n"+
		"By nice direction of a maiden's eyes;\n"+
		"Besides, the lottery of my destiny\n"+
		"Bars me the right of voluntary choosing:\n"+
		"But if my father had not scanted me\n"+
		"And hedged me by his wit, to yield myself\n"+
		"His wife who wins me by that means I told you,\n"+
		"Yourself, renowned prince, then stood as fair\n"+
		"As any comer I have look'd on yet\n"+
		"For my affection.\n"+
		"MOROCCO\n"+
		"Even for that I thank you:\n"+
		"Therefore, I pray you, lead me to the caskets\n"+
		"To try my fortune. By this scimitar\n"+
		"That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince\n"+
		"That won three fields of Sultan Solyman,\n"+
		"I would outstare the sternest eyes that look,\n"+
		"Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth,\n"+
		"Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear,\n"+
		"Yea, mock the lion when he roars for prey,\n"+
		"To win thee, lady. But, alas the while!\n"+
		"If Hercules and Lichas play at dice\n"+
		"Which is the better man, the greater throw\n"+
		"May turn by fortune from the weaker hand:\n"+
		"So is Alcides beaten by his page;\n"+
		"And so may I, blind fortune leading me,\n"+
		"Miss that which one unworthier may attain,\n"+
		"And die with grieving.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"You must take your chance,\n"+
		"And either not attempt to choose at all\n"+
		"Or swear before you choose, if you choose wrong\n"+
		"Never to speak to lady afterward\n"+
		"In way of marriage: therefore be advised.\n"+
		"MOROCCO\n"+
		"Nor will not. Come, bring me unto my chance.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"First, forward to the temple: after dinner\n"+
		"Your hazard shall be made.\n"+
		"MOROCCO\n"+
		"Good fortune then!\n"+
		"To make me blest or cursed'st among men.\n"+
		"Cornets, and exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. Venice. A street.\n"+
		"Enter LAUNCELOT\n"+
		"LAUNCELOT\n"+
		"Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from\n"+
		"this Jew my master. The fiend is at mine elbow and\n"+
		"tempts me saying to me 'Gobbo, Launcelot Gobbo, good\n"+
		"Launcelot,' or 'good Gobbo,' or good Launcelot\n"+
		"Gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run away. My\n"+
		"conscience says 'No; take heed,' honest Launcelot;\n"+
		"take heed, honest Gobbo, or, as aforesaid, 'honest\n"+
		"Launcelot Gobbo; do not run; scorn running with thy\n"+
		"heels.' Well, the most courageous fiend bids me\n"+
		"pack: 'Via!' says the fiend; 'away!' says the\n"+
		"fiend; 'for the heavens, rouse up a brave mind,'\n"+
		"says the fiend, 'and run.' Well, my conscience,\n"+
		"hanging about the neck of my heart, says very wisely\n"+
		"to me 'My honest friend Launcelot, being an honest\n"+
		"man's son,' or rather an honest woman's son; for,\n"+
		"indeed, my father did something smack, something\n"+
		"grow to, he had a kind of taste; well, my conscience\n"+
		"says 'Launcelot, budge not.' 'Budge,' says the\n"+
		"fiend. 'Budge not,' says my conscience.\n"+
		"'Conscience,' say I, 'you counsel well;' ' Fiend,'\n"+
		"say I, 'you counsel well:' to be ruled by my\n"+
		"conscience, I should stay with the Jew my master,\n"+
		"who, God bless the mark, is a kind of devil; and, to\n"+
		"run away from the Jew, I should be ruled by the\n"+
		"fiend, who, saving your reverence, is the devil\n"+
		"himself. Certainly the Jew is the very devil\n"+
		"incarnal; and, in my conscience, my conscience is\n"+
		"but a kind of hard conscience, to offer to counsel\n"+
		"me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more\n"+
		"friendly counsel: I will run, fiend; my heels are\n"+
		"at your command; I will run.\n"+
		"Enter Old GOBBO, with a basket\n"+
		"GOBBO\n"+
		"Master young man, you, I pray you, which is the way\n"+
		"to master Jew's?\n"+
		"LAUNCELOT\n"+
		"[Aside] O heavens, this is my true-begotten father!\n"+
		"who, being more than sand-blind, high-gravel blind,\n"+
		"knows me not: I will try confusions with him.\n"+
		"GOBBO\n"+
		"Master young gentleman, I pray you, which is the way\n"+
		"to master Jew's?\n"+
		"LAUNCELOT\n"+
		"Turn up on your right hand at the next turning, but,\n"+
		"at the next turning of all, on your left; marry, at\n"+
		"the very next turning, turn of no hand, but turn\n"+
		"down indirectly to the Jew's house.\n"+
		"GOBBO\n"+
		"By God's sonties, 'twill be a hard way to hit. Can\n"+
		"you tell me whether one Launcelot,\n"+
		"that dwells with him, dwell with him or no?\n"+
		"LAUNCELOT\n"+
		"Talk you of young Master Launcelot?\n"+
		"Aside\n"+
		"Mark me now; now will I raise the waters. Talk you\n"+
		"of young Master Launcelot?\n"+
		"GOBBO\n"+
		"No master, sir, but a poor man's son: his father,\n"+
		"though I say it, is an honest exceeding poor man\n"+
		"and, God be thanked, well to live.\n"+
		"LAUNCELOT\n"+
		"Well, let his father be what a' will, we talk of\n"+
		"young Master Launcelot.\n"+
		"GOBBO\n"+
		"Your worship's friend and Launcelot, sir.\n"+
		"LAUNCELOT\n"+
		"But I pray you, ergo, old man, ergo, I beseech you,\n"+
		"talk you of young Master Launcelot?\n"+
		"GOBBO\n"+
		"Of Launcelot, an't please your mastership.\n"+
		"LAUNCELOT\n"+
		"Ergo, Master Launcelot. Talk not of Master\n"+
		"Launcelot, father; for the young gentleman,\n"+
		"according to Fates and Destinies and such odd\n"+
		"sayings, the Sisters Three and such branches of\n"+
		"learning, is indeed deceased, or, as you would say\n"+
		"in plain terms, gone to heaven.\n"+
		"GOBBO\n"+
		"Marry, God forbid! the boy was the very staff of my\n"+
		"age, my very prop.\n"+
		"LAUNCELOT\n"+
		"Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post, a staff or\n"+
		"a prop? Do you know me, father?\n"+
		"GOBBO\n"+
		"Alack the day, I know you not, young gentleman:\n"+
		"but, I pray you, tell me, is my boy, God rest his\n"+
		"soul, alive or dead?\n"+
		"LAUNCELOT\n"+
		"Do you not know me, father?\n"+
		"GOBBO\n"+
		"Alack, sir, I am sand-blind; I know you not.\n"+
		"LAUNCELOT\n"+
		"Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might fail of\n"+
		"the knowing me: it is a wise father that knows his\n"+
		"own child. Well, old man, I will tell you news of\n"+
		"your son: give me your blessing: truth will come\n"+
		"to light; murder cannot be hid long; a man's son\n"+
		"may, but at the length truth will out.\n"+
		"GOBBO\n"+
		"Pray you, sir, stand up: I am sure you are not\n"+
		"Launcelot, my boy.\n"+
		"LAUNCELOT\n"+
		"Pray you, let's have no more fooling about it, but\n"+
		"give me your blessing: I am Launcelot, your boy\n"+
		"that was, your son that is, your child that shall\n"+
		"be.\n"+
		"GOBBO\n"+
		"I cannot think you are my son.\n"+
		"LAUNCELOT\n"+
		"I know not what I shall think of that: but I am\n"+
		"Launcelot, the Jew's man, and I am sure Margery your\n"+
		"wife is my mother.\n"+
		"GOBBO\n"+
		"Her name is Margery, indeed: I'll be sworn, if thou\n"+
		"be Launcelot, thou art mine own flesh and blood.\n"+
		"Lord worshipped might he be! what a beard hast thou\n"+
		"got! thou hast got more hair on thy chin than\n"+
		"Dobbin my fill-horse has on his tail.\n"+
		"LAUNCELOT\n"+
		"It should seem, then, that Dobbin's tail grows\n"+
		"backward: I am sure he had more hair of his tail\n"+
		"than I have of my face when I last saw him.\n"+
		"GOBBO\n"+
		"Lord, how art thou changed! How dost thou and thy\n"+
		"master agree? I have brought him a present. How\n"+
		"'gree you now?\n"+
		"LAUNCELOT\n"+
		"Well, well: but, for mine own part, as I have set\n"+
		"up my rest to run away, so I will not rest till I\n"+
		"have run some ground. My master's a very Jew: give\n"+
		"him a present! give him a halter: I am famished in\n"+
		"his service; you may tell every finger I have with\n"+
		"my ribs. Father, I am glad you are come: give me\n"+
		"your present to one Master Bassanio, who, indeed,\n"+
		"gives rare new liveries: if I serve not him, I\n"+
		"will run as far as God has any ground. O rare\n"+
		"fortune! here comes the man: to him, father; for I\n"+
		"am a Jew, if I serve the Jew any longer.\n"+
		"Enter BASSANIO, with LEONARDO and other followers\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"You may do so; but let it be so hasted that supper\n"+
		"be ready at the farthest by five of the clock. See\n"+
		"these letters delivered; put the liveries to making,\n"+
		"and desire Gratiano to come anon to my lodging.\n"+
		"Exit a Servant\n"+
		"LAUNCELOT\n"+
		"To him, father.\n"+
		"GOBBO\n"+
		"God bless your worship!\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"Gramercy! wouldst thou aught with me?\n"+
		"GOBBO\n"+
		"Here's my son, sir, a poor boy,--\n"+
		"LAUNCELOT\n"+
		"Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew's man; that\n"+
		"would, sir, as my father shall specify--\n"+
		"GOBBO\n"+
		"He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to serve--\n"+
		"LAUNCELOT\n"+
		"Indeed, the short and the long is, I serve the Jew,\n"+
		"and have a desire, as my father shall specify--\n"+
		"GOBBO\n"+
		"His master and he, saving your worship's reverence,\n"+
		"are scarce cater-cousins--\n"+
		"LAUNCELOT\n"+
		"To be brief, the very truth is that the Jew, having\n"+
		"done me wrong, doth cause me, as my father, being, I\n"+
		"hope, an old man, shall frutify unto you--\n"+
		"GOBBO\n"+
		"I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon\n"+
		"your worship, and my suit is--\n"+
		"LAUNCELOT\n"+
		"In very brief, the suit is impertinent to myself, as\n"+
		"your worship shall know by this honest old man; and,\n"+
		"though I say it, though old man, yet poor man, my father.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"One speak for both. What would you?\n"+
		"LAUNCELOT\n"+
		"Serve you, sir.\n"+
		"GOBBO\n"+
		"That is the very defect of the matter, sir.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"I know thee well; thou hast obtain'd thy suit:\n"+
		"Shylock thy master spoke with me this day,\n"+
		"And hath preferr'd thee, if it be preferment\n"+
		"To leave a rich Jew's service, to become\n"+
		"The follower of so poor a gentleman.\n"+
		"LAUNCELOT\n"+
		"The old proverb is very well parted between my\n"+
		"master Shylock and you, sir: you have the grace of\n"+
		"God, sir, and he hath enough.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"Thou speak'st it well. Go, father, with thy son.\n"+
		"Take leave of thy old master and inquire\n"+
		"My lodging out. Give him a livery\n"+
		"More guarded than his fellows': see it done.\n"+
		"LAUNCELOT\n"+
		"Father, in. I cannot get a service, no; I have\n"+
		"ne'er a tongue in my head. Well, if any man in\n"+
		"Italy have a fairer table which doth offer to swear\n"+
		"upon a book, I shall have good fortune. Go to,\n"+
		"here's a simple line of life: here's a small trifle\n"+
		"of wives: alas, fifteen wives is nothing! eleven\n"+
		"widows and nine maids is a simple coming-in for one\n"+
		"man: and then to 'scape drowning thrice, and to be\n"+
		"in peril of my life with the edge of a feather-bed;\n"+
		"here are simple scapes. Well, if Fortune be a\n"+
		"woman, she's a good wench for this gear. Father,\n"+
		"come; I'll take my leave of the Jew in the twinkling of an eye.\n"+
		"Exeunt Launcelot and Old Gobbo\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"I pray thee, good Leonardo, think on this:\n"+
		"These things being bought and orderly bestow'd,\n"+
		"Return in haste, for I do feast to-night\n"+
		"My best-esteem'd acquaintance: hie thee, go.\n"+
		"LEONARDO\n"+
		"My best endeavours shall be done herein.\n"+
		"Enter GRATIANO\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"Where is your master?\n"+
		"LEONARDO\n"+
		"Yonder, sir, he walks.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"Signior Bassanio!\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"Gratiano!\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"I have a suit to you.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"You have obtain'd it.\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"You must not deny me: I must go with you to Belmont.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"Why then you must. But hear thee, Gratiano;\n"+
		"Thou art too wild, too rude and bold of voice;\n"+
		"Parts that become thee happily enough\n"+
		"And in such eyes as ours appear not faults;\n"+
		"But where thou art not known, why, there they show\n"+
		"Something too liberal. Pray thee, take pain\n"+
		"To allay with some cold drops of modesty\n"+
		"Thy skipping spirit, lest through thy wild behavior\n"+
		"I be misconstrued in the place I go to,\n"+
		"And lose my hopes.\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"Signior Bassanio, hear me:\n"+
		"If I do not put on a sober habit,\n"+
		"Talk with respect and swear but now and then,\n"+
		"Wear prayer-books in my pocket, look demurely,\n"+
		"Nay more, while grace is saying, hood mine eyes\n"+
		"Thus with my hat, and sigh and say 'amen,'\n"+
		"Use all the observance of civility,\n"+
		"Like one well studied in a sad ostent\n"+
		"To please his grandam, never trust me more.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"Well, we shall see your bearing.\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"Nay, but I bar to-night: you shall not gauge me\n"+
		"By what we do to-night.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"No, that were pity:\n"+
		"I would entreat you rather to put on\n"+
		"Your boldest suit of mirth, for we have friends\n"+
		"That purpose merriment. But fare you well:\n"+
		"I have some business.\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"And I must to Lorenzo and the rest:\n"+
		"But we will visit you at supper-time.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. The same. A room in SHYLOCK'S house.\n"+
		"Enter JESSICA and LAUNCELOT\n"+
		"JESSICA\n"+
		"I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so:\n"+
		"Our house is hell, and thou, a merry devil,\n"+
		"Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness.\n"+
		"But fare thee well, there is a ducat for thee:\n"+
		"And, Launcelot, soon at supper shalt thou see\n"+
		"Lorenzo, who is thy new master's guest:\n"+
		"Give him this letter; do it secretly;\n"+
		"And so farewell: I would not have my father\n"+
		"See me in talk with thee.\n"+
		"LAUNCELOT\n"+
		"Adieu! tears exhibit my tongue. Most beautiful\n"+
		"pagan, most sweet Jew! if a Christian did not play\n"+
		"the knave and get thee, I am much deceived. But,\n"+
		"adieu: these foolish drops do something drown my\n"+
		"manly spirit: adieu.\n"+
		"JESSICA\n"+
		"Farewell, good Launcelot.\n"+
		"Exit Launcelot\n"+
		"Alack, what heinous sin is it in me\n"+
		"To be ashamed to be my father's child!\n"+
		"But though I am a daughter to his blood,\n"+
		"I am not to his manners. O Lorenzo,\n"+
		"If thou keep promise, I shall end this strife,\n"+
		"Become a Christian and thy loving wife.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE IV. The same. A street.\n"+
		"Enter GRATIANO, LORENZO, SALARINO, and SALANIO\n"+
		"LORENZO\n"+
		"Nay, we will slink away in supper-time,\n"+
		"Disguise us at my lodging and return,\n"+
		"All in an hour.\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"We have not made good preparation.\n"+
		"SALARINO\n"+
		"We have not spoke us yet of torchbearers.\n"+
		"SALANIO\n"+
		"'Tis vile, unless it may be quaintly order'd,\n"+
		"And better in my mind not undertook.\n"+
		"LORENZO\n"+
		"'Tis now but four o'clock: we have two hours\n"+
		"To furnish us.\n"+
		"Enter LAUNCELOT, with a letter\n"+
		"Friend Launcelot, what's the news?\n"+
		"LAUNCELOT\n"+
		"An it shall please you to break up\n"+
		"this, it shall seem to signify.\n"+
		"LORENZO\n"+
		"I know the hand: in faith, 'tis a fair hand;\n"+
		"And whiter than the paper it writ on\n"+
		"Is the fair hand that writ.\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"Love-news, in faith.\n"+
		"LAUNCELOT\n"+
		"By your leave, sir.\n"+
		"LORENZO\n"+
		"Whither goest thou?\n"+
		"LAUNCELOT\n"+
		"Marry, sir, to bid my old master the\n"+
		"Jew to sup to-night with my new master the Christian.\n"+
		"LORENZO\n"+
		"Hold here, take this: tell gentle Jessica\n"+
		"I will not fail her; speak it privately.\n"+
		"Go, gentlemen,\n"+
		"Exit Launcelot\n"+
		"Will you prepare you for this masque tonight?\n"+
		"I am provided of a torch-bearer.\n"+
		"SALANIO\n"+
		"Ay, marry, I'll be gone about it straight.\n"+
		"SALANIO\n"+
		"And so will I.\n"+
		"LORENZO\n"+
		"Meet me and Gratiano\n"+
		"At Gratiano's lodging some hour hence.\n"+
		"SALARINO\n"+
		"'Tis good we do so.\n"+
		"Exeunt SALARINO and SALANIO\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"Was not that letter from fair Jessica?\n"+
		"LORENZO\n"+
		"I must needs tell thee all. She hath directed\n"+
		"How I shall take her from her father's house,\n"+
		"What gold and jewels she is furnish'd with,\n"+
		"What page's suit she hath in readiness.\n"+
		"If e'er the Jew her father come to heaven,\n"+
		"It will be for his gentle daughter's sake:\n"+
		"And never dare misfortune cross her foot,\n"+
		"Unless she do it under this excuse,\n"+
		"That she is issue to a faithless Jew.\n"+
		"Come, go with me; peruse this as thou goest:\n"+
		"Fair Jessica shall be my torch-beare r.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE V. The same. Before SHYLOCK'S house.\n"+
		"Enter SHYLOCK and LAUNCELOT\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"Well, thou shalt see, thy eyes shall be thy judge,\n"+
		"The difference of old Shylock and Bassanio:--\n"+
		"What, Jessica!--thou shalt not gormandise,\n"+
		"As thou hast done with me:--What, Jessica!--\n"+
		"And sleep and snore, and rend apparel out;--\n"+
		"Why, Jessica, I say!\n"+
		"LAUNCELOT\n"+

		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"Who bids thee call? I do not bid thee call.\n"+
		"LAUNCELOT\n"+
		"Your worship was wont to tell me that\n"+
		"I could do nothing without bidding.\n"+
		"Enter Jessica\n"+
		"JESSICA\n"+
		"Call you? what is your will?\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"I am bid forth to supper, Jessica:\n"+
		"There are my keys. But wherefore should I go?\n"+
		"I am not bid for love; they flatter me:\n"+
		"But yet I'll go in hate, to feed upon\n"+
		"The prodigal Christian. Jessica, my girl,\n"+
		"Look to my house. I am right loath to go:\n"+
		"There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest,\n"+
		"For I did dream of money-bags to-night.\n"+
		"LAUNCELOT\n"+
		"I beseech you, sir, go: my young master doth expect\n"+
		"your reproach.\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"So do I his.\n"+
		"LAUNCELOT\n"+
		"An they have conspired together, I will not say you\n"+
		"shall see a masque; but if you do, then it was not\n"+
		"for nothing that my nose fell a-bleeding on\n"+
		"Black-Monday last at six o'clock i' the morning,\n"+
		"falling out that year on Ash-Wednesday was four\n"+
		"year, in the afternoon.\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"What, are there masques? Hear you me, Jessica:\n"+
		"Lock up my doors; and when you hear the drum\n"+
		"And the vile squealing of the wry-neck'd fife,\n"+
		"Clamber not you up to the casements then,\n"+
		"Nor thrust your head into the public street\n"+
		"To gaze on Christian fools with varnish'd faces,\n"+
		"But stop my house's ears, I mean my casements:\n"+
		"Let not the sound of shallow foppery enter\n"+
		"My sober house. By Jacob's staff, I swear,\n"+
		"I have no mind of feasting forth to-night:\n"+
		"But I will go. Go you before me, sirrah;\n"+
		"Say I will come.\n"+
		"LAUNCELOT\n"+
		"I will go before, sir. Mistress, look out at\n"+
		"window, for all this, There will come a Christian\n"+
		"boy, will be worth a Jewess' eye.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"What says that fool of Hagar's offspring, ha?\n"+
		"JESSICA\n"+
		"His words were 'Farewell mistress;' nothing else.\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"The patch is kind enough, but a huge feeder;\n"+
		"Snail-slow in profit, and he sleeps by day\n"+
		"More than the wild-cat: drones hive not with me;\n"+
		"Therefore I part with him, and part with him\n"+
		"To one that would have him help to waste\n"+
		"His borrow'd purse. Well, Jessica, go in;\n"+
		"Perhaps I will return immediately:\n"+
		"Do as I bid you; shut doors after you:\n"+

		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE VI. The same.\n"+
		"Enter GRATIANO and SALARINO, masqued\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"This is the pent-house under which Lorenzo\n"+
		"Desired us to make stand.\n"+
		"SALARINO\n"+
		"His hour is almost past.\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"And it is marvel he out-dwells his hour,\n"+
		"For lovers ever run before the clock.\n"+
		"SALARINO\n"+
		"O, ten times faster Venus' pigeons fly\n"+
		"To seal love's bonds new-made, than they are wont\n"+
		"To keep obliged faith unforfeited!\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"That ever holds: who riseth from a feast\n"+
		"With that keen appetite that he sits down?\n"+
		"Where is the horse that doth untread again\n"+
		"His tedious measures with the unbated fire\n"+
		"That he did pace them first? All things that are,\n"+
		"Are with more spirit chased than enjoy'd.\n"+
		"How like a younker or a prodigal\n"+
		"The scarfed bark puts from her native bay,\n"+
		"Hugg'd and embraced by the strumpet wind!\n"+
		"How like the prodigal doth she return,\n"+
		"With over-weather'd ribs and ragged sails,\n"+
		"Lean, rent and beggar'd by the strumpet wind!\n"+
		"SALARINO\n"+
		"Here comes Lorenzo: more of this hereafter.\n"+
		"Enter LORENZO\n"+
		"LORENZO\n"+
		"Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode;\n"+
		"Not I, but my affairs, have made you wait:\n"+
		"When you shall please to play the thieves for wives,\n"+
		"I'll watch as long for you then. Approach;\n"+
		"Here dwells my father Jew. Ho! who's within?\n"+
		"Enter JESSICA, above, in boy's clothes\n"+
		"JESSICA\n"+
		"Who are you? Tell me, for more certainty,\n"+
		"Albeit I'll swear that I do know your tongue.\n"+
		"LORENZO\n"+
		"Lorenzo, and thy love.\n"+
		"JESSICA\n"+
		"Lorenzo, certain, and my love indeed,\n"+
		"For who love I so much? And now who knows\n"+
		"But you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours?\n"+
		"LORENZO\n"+
		"Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art.\n"+
		"JESSICA\n"+
		"Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains.\n"+
		"I am glad 'tis night, you do not look on me,\n"+
		"For I am much ashamed of my exchange:\n"+
		"But love is blind and lovers cannot see\n"+
		"The pretty follies that themselves commit;\n"+
		"For if they could, Cupid himself would blush\n"+
		"To see me thus transformed to a boy.\n"+
		"LORENZO\n"+
		"Descend, for you must be my torchbearer.\n"+
		"JESSICA\n"+
		"What, must I hold a candle to my shames?\n"+
		"They in themselves, good-sooth, are too too light.\n"+
		"Why, 'tis an office of discovery, love;\n"+
		"And I should be obscured.\n"+
		"LORENZO\n"+
		"So are you, sweet,\n"+
		"Even in the lovely garnish of a boy.\n"+
		"But come at once;\n"+
		"For the close night doth play the runaway,\n"+
		"And we are stay'd for at Bassanio's feast.\n"+
		"JESSICA\n"+
		"I will make fast the doors, and gild myself\n"+
		"With some more ducats, and be with you straight.\n"+
		"Exit above\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"Now, by my hood, a Gentile and no Jew.\n"+
		"LORENZO\n"+
		"Beshrew me but I love her heartily;\n"+
		"For she is wise, if I can judge of her,\n"+
		"And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true,\n"+
		"And true she is, as she hath proved herself,\n"+
		"And therefore, like herself, wise, fair and true,\n"+
		"Shall she be placed in my constant soul.\n"+
		"Enter JESSICA, below\n"+
		"What, art thou come? On, gentlemen; away!\n"+
		"Our masquing mates by this time for us stay.\n"+
		"Exit with Jessica and Salarino\n"+
		"Enter ANTONIO\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Who's there?\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"Signior Antonio!\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Fie, fie, Gratiano! where are all the rest?\n"+
		"'Tis nine o'clock: our friends all stay for you.\n"+
		"No masque to-night: the wind is come about;\n"+
		"Bassanio presently will go aboard:\n"+
		"I have sent twenty out to seek for you.\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"I am glad on't: I desire no more delight\n"+
		"Than to be under sail and gone to-night.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE VII. Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.\n"+
		"Flourish of cornets. Enter PORTIA, with the PRINCE OF MOROCCO, and their trains\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Go draw aside the curtains and discover\n"+
		"The several caskets to this noble prince.\n"+
		"Now make your choice.\n"+
		"MOROCCO\n"+
		"The first, of gold, who this inscription bears,\n"+
		"'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire;'\n"+
		"The second, silver, which this promise carries,\n"+
		"'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves;'\n"+
		"This third, dull lead, with warning all as blunt,\n"+
		"'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'\n"+
		"How shall I know if I do choose the right?\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"The one of them contains my picture, prince:\n"+
		"If you choose that, then I am yours withal.\n"+
		"MOROCCO\n"+
		"Some god direct my judgment! Let me see;\n"+
		"I will survey the inscriptions back again.\n"+
		"What says this leaden casket?\n"+
		"'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'\n"+
		"Must give: for what? for lead? hazard for lead?\n"+
		"This casket threatens. Men that hazard all\n"+
		"Do it in hope of fair advantages:\n"+
		"A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross;\n"+
		"I'll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.\n"+
		"What says the silver with her virgin hue?\n"+
		"'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'\n"+
		"As much as he deserves! Pause there, Morocco,\n"+
		"And weigh thy value with an even hand:\n"+
		"If thou be'st rated by thy estimation,\n"+
		"Thou dost deserve enough; and yet enough\n"+
		"May not extend so far as to the lady:\n"+
		"And yet to be afeard of my deserving\n"+
		"Were but a weak disabling of myself.\n"+
		"As much as I deserve! Why, that's the lady:\n"+
		"I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes,\n"+
		"In graces and in qualities of breeding;\n"+
		"But more than these, in love I do deserve.\n"+
		"What if I stray'd no further, but chose here?\n"+
		"Let's see once more this saying graved in gold\n"+
		"'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'\n"+
		"Why, that's the lady; all the world desires her;\n"+
		"From the four corners of the earth they come,\n"+
		"To kiss this shrine, this mortal-breathing saint:\n"+
		"The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds\n"+
		"Of wide Arabia are as thoroughfares now\n"+
		"For princes to come view fair Portia:\n"+
		"The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head\n"+
		"Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar\n"+
		"To stop the foreign spirits, but they come,\n"+
		"As o'er a brook, to see fair Portia.\n"+
		"One of these three contains her heavenly picture.\n"+
		"Is't like that lead contains her? 'Twere damnation\n"+
		"To think so base a thought: it were too gross\n"+
		"To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.\n"+
		"Or shall I think in silver she's immured,\n"+
		"Being ten times undervalued to tried gold?\n"+
		"O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem\n"+
		"Was set in worse than gold. They have in England\n"+
		"A coin that bears the figure of an angel\n"+
		"Stamped in gold, but that's insculp'd upon;\n"+
		"But here an angel in a golden bed\n"+
		"Lies all within. Deliver me the key:\n"+
		"Here do I choose, and thrive I as I may!\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"There, take it, prince; and if my form lie there,\n"+
		"Then I am yours.\n"+
		"He unlocks the golden casket\n"+
		"MOROCCO\n"+
		"O hell! what have we here?\n"+
		"A carrion Death, within whose empty eye\n"+
		"There is a written scroll! I'll read the writing.\n"+
		"Reads\n"+
		"All that glitters is not gold;\n"+
		"Often have you heard that told:\n"+
		"Many a man his life hath sold\n"+
		"But my outside to behold:\n"+
		"Gilded tombs do worms enfold.\n"+
		"Had you been as wise as bold,\n"+
		"Young in limbs, in judgment old,\n"+
		"Your answer had not been inscroll'd:\n"+
		"Fare you well; your suit is cold.\n"+
		"Cold, indeed; and labour lost:\n"+
		"Then, farewell, heat, and welcome, frost!\n"+
		"Portia, adieu. I have too grieved a heart\n"+
		"To take a tedious leave: thus losers part.\n"+
		"Exit with his train. Flourish of cornets\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"A gentle riddance. Draw the curtains, go.\n"+
		"Let all of his complexion choose me so.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE VIII. Venice. A street.\n"+
		"Enter SALARINO and SALANIO\n"+
		"SALARINO\n"+
		"Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail:\n"+
		"With him is Gratiano gone along;\n"+
		"And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not.\n"+
		"SALANIO\n"+
		"The villain Jew with outcries raised the duke,\n"+
		"Who went with him to search Bassanio's ship.\n"+
		"SALARINO\n"+
		"He came too late, the ship was under sail:\n"+
		"But there the duke was given to understand\n"+
		"That in a gondola were seen together\n"+
		"Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica:\n"+
		"Besides, Antonio certified the duke\n"+
		"They were not with Bassanio in his ship.\n"+
		"SALANIO\n"+
		"I never heard a passion so confused,\n"+
		"So strange, outrageous, and so variable,\n"+
		"As the dog Jew did utter in the streets:\n"+
		"'My daughter! O my ducats! O my daughter!\n"+
		"Fled with a Christian! O my Christian ducats!\n"+
		"Justice! the law! my ducats, and my daughter!\n"+
		"A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,\n"+
		"Of double ducats, stolen from me by my daughter!\n"+
		"And jewels, two stones, two rich and precious stones,\n"+
		"Stolen by my daughter! Justice! find the girl;\n"+
		"She hath the stones upon her, and the ducats.'\n"+
		"SALARINO\n"+
		"Why, all the boys in Venice follow him,\n"+
		"Crying, his stones, his daughter, and his ducats.\n"+
		"SALANIO\n"+
		"Let good Antonio look he keep his day,\n"+
		"Or he shall pay for this.\n"+
		"SALARINO\n"+
		"Marry, well remember'd.\n"+
		"I reason'd with a Frenchman yesterday,\n"+
		"Who told me, in the narrow seas that part\n"+
		"The French and English, there miscarried\n"+
		"A vessel of our country richly fraught:\n"+
		"I thought upon Antonio when he told me;\n"+
		"And wish'd in silence that it were not his.\n"+
		"SALANIO\n"+
		"You were best to tell Antonio what you hear;\n"+
		"Yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him.\n"+
		"SALARINO\n"+
		"A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.\n"+
		"I saw Bassanio and Antonio part:\n"+
		"Bassanio told him he would make some speed\n"+
		"Of his return: he answer'd, 'Do not so;\n"+
		"Slubber not business for my sake, Bassanio\n"+
		"But stay the very riping of the time;\n"+
		"And for the Jew's bond which he hath of me,\n"+
		"Let it not enter in your mind of love:\n"+
		"Be merry, and employ your chiefest thoughts\n"+
		"To courtship and such fair ostents of love\n"+
		"As shall conveniently become you there:'\n"+
		"And even there, his eye being big with tears,\n"+
		"Turning his face, he put his hand behind him,\n"+
		"And with affection wondrous sensible\n"+
		"He wrung Bassanio's hand; and so they parted.\n"+
		"SALANIO\n"+
		"I think he only loves the world for him.\n"+
		"I pray thee, let us go and find him out\n"+
		"And quicken his embraced heaviness\n"+
		"With some delight or other.\n"+
		"SALARINO\n"+
		"Do we so.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IX. Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.\n"+
		"Enter NERISSA with a Servitor\n"+
		"NERISSA\n"+
		"Quick, quick, I pray thee; draw the curtain straight:\n"+
		"The Prince of Arragon hath ta'en his oath,\n"+
		"And comes to his election presently.\n"+
		"Flourish of cornets. Enter the PRINCE OF ARRAGON, PORTIA, and their trains\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Behold, there stand the caskets, noble prince:\n"+
		"If you choose that wherein I am contain'd,\n"+
		"Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized:\n"+
		"But if you fail, without more speech, my lord,\n"+
		"You must be gone from hence immediately.\n"+
		"ARRAGON\n"+
		"I am enjoin'd by oath to observe three things:\n"+
		"First, never to unfold to any one\n"+
		"Which casket 'twas I chose; next, if I fail\n"+
		"Of the right casket, never in my life\n"+
		"To woo a maid in way of marriage: Lastly,\n"+
		"If I do fail in fortune of my choice,\n"+
		"Immediately to leave you and be gone.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"To these injunctions every one doth swear\n"+
		"That comes to hazard for my worthless self.\n"+
		"ARRAGON\n"+
		"And so have I address'd me. Fortune now\n"+
		"To my heart's hope! Gold; silver; and base lead.\n"+
		"'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'\n"+
		"You shall look fairer, ere I give or hazard.\n"+
		"What says the golden chest? ha! let me see:\n"+
		"'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'\n"+
		"What many men desire! that 'many' may be meant\n"+
		"By the fool multitude, that choose by show,\n"+
		"Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;\n"+
		"Which pries not to the interior, but, like the martlet,\n"+
		"Builds in the weather on the outward wall,\n"+
		"Even in the force and road of casualty.\n"+
		"I will not choose what many men desire,\n"+
		"Because I will not jump with common spirits\n"+
		"And rank me with the barbarous multitudes.\n"+
		"Why, then to thee, thou silver treasure-house;\n"+
		"Tell me once more what title thou dost bear:\n"+
		"'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves:'\n"+
		"And well said too; for who shall go about\n"+
		"To cozen fortune and be honourable\n"+
		"Without the stamp of merit? Let none presume\n"+
		"To wear an undeserved dignity.\n"+
		"O, that estates, degrees and offices\n"+
		"Were not derived corruptly, and that clear honour\n"+
		"Were purchased by the merit of the wearer!\n"+
		"How many then should cover that stand bare!\n"+
		"How many be commanded that command!\n"+
		"How much low peasantry would then be glean'd\n"+
		"From the true seed of honour! and how much honour\n"+
		"Pick'd from the chaff and ruin of the times\n"+
		"To be new-varnish'd! Well, but to my choice:\n"+
		"'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'\n"+
		"I will assume desert. Give me a key for this,\n"+
		"And instantly unlock my fortunes here.\n"+
		"He opens the silver casket\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Too long a pause for that which you find there.\n"+
		"ARRAGON\n"+
		"What's here? the portrait of a blinking idiot,\n"+
		"Presenting me a schedule! I will read it.\n"+
		"How much unlike art thou to Portia!\n"+
		"How much unlike my hopes and my deservings!\n"+
		"'Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves.'\n"+
		"Did I deserve no more than a fool's head?\n"+
		"Is that my prize? are my deserts no better?\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"To offend, and judge, are distinct offices\n"+
		"And of opposed natures.\n"+
		"ARRAGON\n"+
		"What is here?\n"+
		"Reads\n"+
		"The fire seven times tried this:\n"+
		"Seven times tried that judgment is,\n"+
		"That did never choose amiss.\n"+
		"Some there be that shadows kiss;\n"+
		"Such have but a shadow's bliss:\n"+
		"There be fools alive, I wis,\n"+
		"Silver'd o'er; and so was this.\n"+
		"Take what wife you will to bed,\n"+
		"I will ever be your head:\n"+
		"So be gone: you are sped.\n"+
		"Still more fool I shall appear\n"+
		"By the time I linger here\n"+
		"With one fool's head I came to woo,\n"+
		"But I go away with two.\n"+
		"Sweet, adieu. I'll keep my oath,\n"+
		"Patiently to bear my wroth.\n"+
		"Exeunt Arragon and train\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Thus hath the candle singed the moth.\n"+
		"O, these deliberate fools! when they do choose,\n"+
		"They have the wisdom by their wit to lose.\n"+
		"NERISSA\n"+
		"The ancient saying is no heresy,\n"+
		"Hanging and wiving goes by destiny.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Come, draw the curtain, Nerissa.\n"+
		"Enter a Servant\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"Where is my lady?\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Here: what would my lord?\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"Madam, there is alighted at your gate\n"+
		"A young Venetian, one that comes before\n"+
		"To signify the approaching of his lord;\n"+
		"From whom he bringeth sensible regreets,\n"+
		"To wit, besides commends and courteous breath,\n"+
		"Gifts of rich value. Yet I have not seen\n"+
		"So likely an ambassador of love:\n"+
		"A day in April never came so sweet,\n"+
		"To show how costly summer was at hand,\n"+
		"As this fore-spurrer comes before his lord.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"No more, I pray thee: I am half afeard\n"+
		"Thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee,\n"+
		"Thou spend'st such high-day wit in praising him.\n"+
		"Come, come, Nerissa; for I long to see\n"+
		"Quick Cupid's post that comes so mannerly.\n"+
		"NERISSA\n"+
		"Bassanio, lord Love, if thy will it be!\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT III\n"+
		"SCENE I. Venice. A street.\n"+
		"Enter SALANIO and SALARINO\n"+
		"SALANIO\n"+
		"Now, what news on the Rialto?\n"+
		"SALARINO\n"+
		"Why, yet it lives there uncheck'd that Antonio hath\n"+
		"a ship of rich lading wrecked on the narrow seas;\n"+
		"the Goodwins, I think they call the place; a very\n"+
		"dangerous flat and fatal, where the carcasses of many\n"+
		"a tall ship lie buried, as they say, if my gossip\n"+
		"Report be an honest woman of her word.\n"+
		"SALANIO\n"+
		"I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever\n"+
		"knapped ginger or made her neighbours believe she\n"+
		"wept for the death of a third husband. But it is\n"+
		"true, without any slips of prolixity or crossing the\n"+
		"plain highway of talk, that the good Antonio, the\n"+
		"honest Antonio,--O that I had a title good enough\n"+
		"to keep his name company!--\n"+
		"SALARINO\n"+
		"Come, the full stop.\n"+
		"SALANIO\n"+
		"Ha! what sayest thou? Why, the end is, he hath\n"+
		"lost a ship.\n"+
		"SALARINO\n"+
		"I would it might prove the end of his losses.\n"+
		"SALANIO\n"+
		"Let me say 'amen' betimes, lest the devil cross my\n"+
		"prayer, for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew.\n"+
		"Enter SHYLOCK\n"+
		"How now, Shylock! what news among the merchants?\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"You know, none so well, none so well as you, of my\n"+
		"daughter's flight.\n"+
		"SALARINO\n"+
		"That's certain: I, for my part, knew the tailor\n"+
		"that made the wings she flew withal.\n"+
		"SALANIO\n"+
		"And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was\n"+
		"fledged; and then it is the complexion of them all\n"+
		"to leave the dam.\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"She is damned for it.\n"+
		"SALANIO\n"+
		"That's certain, if the devil may be her judge.\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"My own flesh and blood to rebel!\n"+
		"SALANIO\n"+
		"Out upon it, old carrion! rebels it at these years?\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"I say, my daughter is my flesh and blood.\n"+
		"SALARINO\n"+
		"There is more difference between thy flesh and hers\n"+
		"than between jet and ivory; more between your bloods\n"+
		"than there is between red wine and rhenish. But\n"+
		"tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have had any\n"+
		"loss at sea or no?\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"There I have another bad match: a bankrupt, a\n"+
		"prodigal, who dare scarce show his head on the\n"+
		"Rialto; a beggar, that was used to come so smug upon\n"+
		"the mart; let him look to his bond: he was wont to\n"+
		"call me usurer; let him look to his bond: he was\n"+
		"wont to lend money for a Christian courtesy; let him\n"+
		"look to his bond.\n"+
		"SALARINO\n"+
		"Why, I am sure, if he forfeit, thou wilt not take\n"+
		"his flesh: what's that good for?\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"To bait fish withal: if it will feed nothing else,\n"+
		"it will feed my revenge. He hath disgraced me, and\n"+
		"hindered me half a million; laughed at my losses,\n"+
		"mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my\n"+
		"bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine\n"+
		"enemies; and what's his reason? I am a Jew. Hath\n"+
		"not a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew hands, organs,\n"+
		"dimensions, senses, affections, passions? fed with\n"+
		"the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject\n"+
		"to the same diseases, healed by the same means,\n"+
		"warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer, as\n"+
		"a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed?\n"+
		"if you tickle us, do we not laugh? if you poison\n"+
		"us, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall we not\n"+
		"revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will\n"+
		"resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian,\n"+
		"what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian\n"+
		"wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by\n"+
		"Christian example? Why, revenge. The villany you\n"+
		"teach me, I will execute, and it shall go hard but I\n"+
		"will better the instruction.\n"+
		"Enter a Servant\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"Gentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house and\n"+
		"desires to speak with you both.\n"+
		"SALARINO\n"+
		"We have been up and down to seek him.\n"+
		"Enter TUBAL\n"+
		"SALANIO\n"+
		"Here comes another of the tribe: a third cannot be\n"+
		"matched, unless the devil himself turn Jew.\n"+
		"Exeunt SALANIO, SALARINO, and Servant\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"How now, Tubal! what news from Genoa? hast thou\n"+
		"found my daughter?\n"+
		"TUBAL\n"+
		"I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her.\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"Why, there, there, there, there! a diamond gone,\n"+
		"cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfort! The curse\n"+
		"never fell upon our nation till now; I never felt it\n"+
		"till now: two thousand ducats in that; and other\n"+
		"precious, precious jewels. I would my daughter\n"+
		"were dead at my foot, and the jewels in her ear!\n"+
		"would she were hearsed at my foot, and the ducats in\n"+
		"her coffin! No news of them? Why, so: and I know\n"+
		"not what's spent in the search: why, thou loss upon\n"+
		"loss! the thief gone with so much, and so much to\n"+
		"find the thief; and no satisfaction, no revenge:\n"+
		"nor no in luck stirring but what lights on my\n"+
		"shoulders; no sighs but of my breathing; no tears\n"+
		"but of my shedding.\n"+
		"TUBAL\n"+
		"Yes, other men have ill luck too: Antonio, as I\n"+
		"heard in Genoa,--\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"What, what, what? ill luck, ill luck?\n"+
		"TUBAL\n"+
		"Hath an argosy cast away, coming from Tripolis.\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"I thank God, I thank God. Is't true, is't true?\n"+
		"TUBAL\n"+
		"I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck.\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"I thank thee, good Tubal: good news, good news!\n"+
		"ha, ha! where? in Genoa?\n"+
		"TUBAL\n"+
		"Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, in one\n"+
		"night fourscore ducats.\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"Thou stickest a dagger in me: I shall never see my\n"+
		"gold again: fourscore ducats at a sitting!\n"+
		"fourscore ducats!\n"+
		"TUBAL\n"+
		"There came divers of Antonio's creditors in my\n"+
		"company to Venice, that swear he cannot choose but break.\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"I am very glad of it: I'll plague him; I'll torture\n"+
		"him: I am glad of it.\n"+
		"TUBAL\n"+
		"One of them showed me a ring that he had of your\n"+
		"daughter for a monkey.\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal: it was my\n"+
		"turquoise; I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor:\n"+
		"I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.\n"+
		"TUBAL\n"+
		"But Antonio is certainly undone.\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"Nay, that's true, that's very true. Go, Tubal, fee\n"+
		"me an officer; bespeak him a fortnight before. I\n"+
		"will have the heart of him, if he forfeit; for, were\n"+
		"he out of Venice, I can make what merchandise I\n"+
		"will. Go, go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue;\n"+
		"go, good Tubal; at our synagogue, Tubal.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.\n"+
		"Enter BASSANIO, PORTIA, GRATIANO, NERISSA, and Attendants\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"I pray you, tarry: pause a day or two\n"+
		"Before you hazard; for, in choosing wrong,\n"+
		"I lose your company: therefore forbear awhile.\n"+
		"There's something tells me, but it is not love,\n"+
		"I would not lose you; and you know yourself,\n"+
		"Hate counsels not in such a quality.\n"+
		"But lest you should not understand me well,--\n"+
		"And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought,--\n"+
		"I would detain you here some month or two\n"+
		"Before you venture for me. I could teach you\n"+
		"How to choose right, but I am then forsworn;\n"+
		"So will I never be: so may you miss me;\n"+
		"But if you do, you'll make me wish a sin,\n"+
		"That I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes,\n"+
		"They have o'erlook'd me and divided me;\n"+
		"One half of me is yours, the other half yours,\n"+
		"Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours,\n"+
		"And so all yours. O, these naughty times\n"+
		"Put bars between the owners and their rights!\n"+
		"And so, though yours, not yours. Prove it so,\n"+
		"Let fortune go to hell for it, not I.\n"+
		"I speak too long; but 'tis to peize the time,\n"+
		"To eke it and to draw it out in length,\n"+
		"To stay you from election.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"Let me choose\n"+
		"For as I am, I live upon the rack.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Upon the rack, Bassanio! then confess\n"+
		"What treason there is mingled with your love.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"None but that ugly treason of mistrust,\n"+
		"Which makes me fear the enjoying of my love:\n"+
		"There may as well be amity and life\n"+
		"'Tween snow and fire, as treason and my love.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack,\n"+
		"Where men enforced do speak anything.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"Promise me life, and I'll confess the truth.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Well then, confess and live.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"'Confess' and 'love'\n"+
		"Had been the very sum of my confession:\n"+
		"O happy torment, when my torturer\n"+
		"Doth teach me answers for deliverance!\n"+
		"But let me to my fortune and the caskets.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Away, then! I am lock'd in one of them:\n"+
		"If you do love me, you will find me out.\n"+
		"Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.\n"+
		"Let music sound while he doth make his choice;\n"+
		"Then, if he lose, he makes a swan-like end,\n"+
		"Fading in music: that the comparison\n"+
		"May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream\n"+
		"And watery death-bed for him. He may win;\n"+
		"And what is music then? Then music is\n"+
		"Even as the flourish when true subjects bow\n"+
		"To a new-crowned monarch: such it is\n"+
		"As are those dulcet sounds in break of day\n"+
		"That creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear,\n"+
		"And summon him to marriage. Now he goes,\n"+
		"With no less presence, but with much more love,\n"+
		"Than young Alcides, when he did redeem\n"+
		"The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy\n"+
		"To the sea-monster: I stand for sacrifice\n"+
		"The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives,\n"+
		"With bleared visages, come forth to view\n"+
		"The issue of the exploit. Go, Hercules!\n"+
		"Live thou, I live: with much, much more dismay\n"+
		"I view the fight than thou that makest the fray.\n"+
		"Music, whilst BASSANIO comments on the caskets to himself\n"+
		"SONG.\n"+
		"Tell me where is fancy bred,\n"+
		"Or in the heart, or in the head?\n"+
		"How begot, how nourished?\n"+
		"Reply, reply.\n"+
		"It is engender'd in the eyes,\n"+
		"With gazing fed; and fancy dies\n"+
		"In the cradle where it lies.\n"+
		"Let us all ring fancy's knell\n"+
		"I'll begin it,--Ding, dong, bell.\n"+
		"ALL\n"+
		"Ding, dong, bell.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"So may the outward shows be least themselves:\n"+
		"The world is still deceived with ornament.\n"+
		"In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt,\n"+
		"But, being seasoned with a gracious voice,\n"+
		"Obscures the show of evil? In religion,\n"+
		"What damned error, but some sober brow\n"+
		"Will bless it and approve it with a text,\n"+
		"Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?\n"+
		"There is no vice so simple but assumes\n"+
		"Some mark of virtue on his outward parts:\n"+
		"How many cowards, whose hearts are all as false\n"+
		"As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins\n"+
		"The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars;\n"+
		"Who, inward search'd, have livers white as milk;\n"+
		"And these assume but valour's excrement\n"+
		"To render them redoubted! Look on beauty,\n"+
		"And you shall see 'tis purchased by the weight;\n"+
		"Which therein works a miracle in nature,\n"+
		"Making them lightest that wear most of it:\n"+
		"So are those crisped snaky golden locks\n"+
		"Which make such wanton gambols with the wind,\n"+
		"Upon supposed fairness, often known\n"+
		"To be the dowry of a second head,\n"+
		"The skull that bred them in the sepulchre.\n"+
		"Thus ornament is but the guiled shore\n"+
		"To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf\n"+
		"Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word,\n"+
		"The seeming truth which cunning times put on\n"+
		"To entrap the wisest. Therefore, thou gaudy gold,\n"+
		"Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee;\n"+
		"Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge\n"+
		"'Tween man and man: but thou, thou meagre lead,\n"+
		"Which rather threatenest than dost promise aught,\n"+
		"Thy paleness moves me more than eloquence;\n"+
		"And here choose I; joy be the consequence!\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"[Aside] How all the other passions fleet to air,\n"+
		"As doubtful thoughts, and rash-embraced despair,\n"+
		"And shuddering fear, and green-eyed jealousy! O love,\n"+
		"Be moderate; allay thy ecstasy,\n"+
		"In measure rein thy joy; scant this excess.\n"+
		"I feel too much thy blessing: make it less,\n"+
		"For fear I surfeit.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"What find I here?\n"+
		"Opening the leaden casket\n"+
		"Fair Portia's counterfeit! What demi-god\n"+
		"Hath come so near creation? Move these eyes?\n"+
		"Or whether, riding on the balls of mine,\n"+
		"Seem they in motion? Here are sever'd lips,\n"+
		"Parted with sugar breath: so sweet a bar\n"+
		"Should sunder such sweet friends. Here in her hairs\n"+
		"The painter plays the spider and hath woven\n"+
		"A golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men,\n"+
		"Faster than gnats in cobwebs; but her eyes,--\n"+
		"How could he see to do them? having made one,\n"+
		"Methinks it should have power to steal both his\n"+
		"And leave itself unfurnish'd. Yet look, how far\n"+
		"The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow\n"+
		"In underprizing it, so far this shadow\n"+
		"Doth limp behind the substance. Here's the scroll,\n"+
		"The continent and summary of my fortune.\n"+
		"Reads\n"+
		"You that choose not by the view,\n"+
		"Chance as fair and choose as true!\n"+
		"Since this fortune falls to you,\n"+
		"Be content and seek no new,\n"+
		"If you be well pleased with this\n"+
		"And hold your fortune for your bliss,\n"+
		"Turn you where your lady is\n"+
		"And claim her with a loving kiss.\n"+
		"A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave;\n"+
		"I come by note, to give and to receive.\n"+
		"Like one of two contending in a prize,\n"+
		"That thinks he hath done well in people's eyes,\n"+
		"Hearing applause and universal shout,\n"+
		"Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt\n"+
		"Whether these pearls of praise be his or no;\n"+
		"So, thrice fair lady, stand I, even so;\n"+
		"As doubtful whether what I see be true,\n"+
		"Until confirm'd, sign'd, ratified by you.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand,\n"+
		"Such as I am: though for myself alone\n"+
		"I would not be ambitious in my wish,\n"+
		"To wish myself much better; yet, for you\n"+
		"I would be trebled twenty times myself;\n"+
		"A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich;\n"+
		"That only to stand high in your account,\n"+
		"I might in virtue, beauties, livings, friends,\n"+
		"Exceed account; but the full sum of me\n"+
		"Is sum of something, which, to term in gross,\n"+
		"Is an unlesson'd girl, unschool'd, unpractised;\n"+
		"Happy in this, she is not yet so old\n"+
		"But she may learn; happier than this,\n"+
		"She is not bred so dull but she can learn;\n"+
		"Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit\n"+
		"Commits itself to yours to be directed,\n"+
		"As from her lord, her governor, her king.\n"+
		"Myself and what is mine to you and yours\n"+
		"Is now converted: but now I was the lord\n"+
		"Of this fair mansion, master of my servants,\n"+
		"Queen o'er myself: and even now, but now,\n"+
		"This house, these servants and this same myself\n"+
		"Are yours, my lord: I give them with this ring;\n"+
		"Which when you part from, lose, or give away,\n"+
		"Let it presage the ruin of your love\n"+
		"And be my vantage to exclaim on you.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"Madam, you have bereft me of all words,\n"+
		"Only my blood speaks to you in my veins;\n"+
		"And there is such confusion in my powers,\n"+
		"As after some oration fairly spoke\n"+
		"By a beloved prince, there doth appear\n"+
		"Among the buzzing pleased multitude;\n"+
		"Where every something, being blent together,\n"+
		"Turns to a wild of nothing, save of joy,\n"+
		"Express'd and not express'd. But when this ring\n"+
		"Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence:\n"+
		"O, then be bold to say Bassanio's dead!\n"+
		"NERISSA\n"+
		"My lord and lady, it is now our time,\n"+
		"That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper,\n"+
		"To cry, good joy: good joy, my lord and lady!\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"My lord Bassanio and my gentle lady,\n"+
		"I wish you all the joy that you can wish;\n"+
		"For I am sure you can wish none from me:\n"+
		"And when your honours mean to solemnize\n"+
		"The bargain of your faith, I do beseech you,\n"+
		"Even at that time I may be married too.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"I thank your lordship, you have got me one.\n"+
		"My eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours:\n"+
		"You saw the mistress, I beheld the maid;\n"+
		"You loved, I loved for intermission.\n"+
		"No more pertains to me, my lord, than you.\n"+
		"Your fortune stood upon the casket there,\n"+
		"And so did mine too, as the matter falls;\n"+
		"For wooing here until I sweat again,\n"+
		"And sweating until my very roof was dry\n"+
		"With oaths of love, at last, if promise last,\n"+
		"I got a promise of this fair one here\n"+
		"To have her love, provided that your fortune\n"+
		"Achieved her mistress.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Is this true, Nerissa?\n"+
		"NERISSA\n"+
		"Madam, it is, so you stand pleased withal.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"Yes, faith, my lord.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"Our feast shall be much honour'd in your marriage.\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"We'll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats.\n"+
		"NERISSA\n"+
		"What, and stake down?\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"No; we shall ne'er win at that sport, and stake down.\n"+
		"But who comes here? Lorenzo and his infidel? What,\n"+
		"and my old Venetian friend Salerio?\n"+
		"Enter LORENZO, JESSICA, and SALERIO, a Messenger from Venice\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither;\n"+
		"If that the youth of my new interest here\n"+
		"Have power to bid you welcome. By your leave,\n"+
		"I bid my very friends and countrymen,\n"+
		"Sweet Portia, welcome.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"So do I, my lord:\n"+
		"They are entirely welcome.\n"+
		"LORENZO\n"+
		"I thank your honour. For my part, my lord,\n"+
		"My purpose was not to have seen you here;\n"+
		"But meeting with Salerio by the way,\n"+
		"He did entreat me, past all saying nay,\n"+
		"To come with him along.\n"+
		"SALERIO\n"+
		"I did, my lord;\n"+
		"And I have reason for it. Signior Antonio\n"+
		"Commends him to you.\n"+
		"Gives Bassanio a letter\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"Ere I ope his letter,\n"+
		"I pray you, tell me how my good friend doth.\n"+
		"SALERIO\n"+
		"Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind;\n"+
		"Nor well, unless in mind: his letter there\n"+
		"Will show you his estate.\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"Nerissa, cheer yon stranger; bid her welcome.\n"+
		"Your hand, Salerio: what's the news from Venice?\n"+
		"How doth that royal merchant, good Antonio?\n"+
		"I know he will be glad of our success;\n"+
		"We are the Jasons, we have won the fleece.\n"+
		"SALERIO\n"+
		"I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"There are some shrewd contents in yon same paper,\n"+
		"That steals the colour from Bassanio's cheek:\n"+
		"Some dear friend dead; else nothing in the world\n"+
		"Could turn so much the constitution\n"+
		"Of any constant man. What, worse and worse!\n"+
		"With leave, Bassanio: I am half yourself,\n"+
		"And I must freely have the half of anything\n"+
		"That this same paper brings you.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"O sweet Portia,\n"+
		"Here are a few of the unpleasant'st words\n"+
		"That ever blotted paper! Gentle lady,\n"+
		"When I did first impart my love to you,\n"+
		"I freely told you, all the wealth I had\n"+
		"Ran in my veins, I was a gentleman;\n"+
		"And then I told you true: and yet, dear lady,\n"+
		"Rating myself at nothing, you shall see\n"+
		"How much I was a braggart. When I told you\n"+
		"My state was nothing, I should then have told you\n"+
		"That I was worse than nothing; for, indeed,\n"+
		"I have engaged myself to a dear friend,\n"+
		"Engaged my friend to his mere enemy,\n"+
		"To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady;\n"+
		"The paper as the body of my friend,\n"+
		"And every word in it a gaping wound,\n"+
		"Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio?\n"+
		"Have all his ventures fail'd? What, not one hit?\n"+
		"From Tripolis, from Mexico and England,\n"+
		"From Lisbon, Barbary and India?\n"+
		"And not one vessel 'scape the dreadful touch\n"+
		"Of merchant-marring rocks?\n"+
		"SALERIO\n"+
		"Not one, my lord.\n"+
		"Besides, it should appear, that if he had\n"+
		"The present money to discharge the Jew,\n"+
		"He would not take it. Never did I know\n"+
		"A creature, that did bear the shape of man,\n"+
		"So keen and greedy to confound a man:\n"+
		"He plies the duke at morning and at night,\n"+
		"And doth impeach the freedom of the state,\n"+
		"If they deny him justice: twenty merchants,\n"+
		"The duke himself, and the magnificoes\n"+
		"Of greatest port, have all persuaded with him;\n"+
		"But none can drive him from the envious plea\n"+
		"Of forfeiture, of justice and his bond.\n"+
		"JESSICA\n"+
		"When I was with him I have heard him swear\n"+
		"To Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen,\n"+
		"That he would rather have Antonio's flesh\n"+
		"Than twenty times the value of the sum\n"+
		"That he did owe him: and I know, my lord,\n"+
		"If law, authority and power deny not,\n"+
		"It will go hard with poor Antonio.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"The dearest friend to me, the kindest man,\n"+
		"The best-condition'd and unwearied spirit\n"+
		"In doing courtesies, and one in whom\n"+
		"The ancient Roman honour more appears\n"+
		"Than any that draws breath in Italy.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"What sum owes he the Jew?\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"For me three thousand ducats.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"What, no more?\n"+
		"Pay him six thousand, and deface the bond;\n"+
		"Double six thousand, and then treble that,\n"+
		"Before a friend of this description\n"+
		"Shall lose a hair through Bassanio's fault.\n"+
		"First go with me to church and call me wife,\n"+
		"And then away to Venice to your friend;\n"+
		"For never shall you lie by Portia's side\n"+
		"With an unquiet soul. You shall have gold\n"+
		"To pay the petty debt twenty times over:\n"+
		"When it is paid, bring your true friend along.\n"+
		"My maid Nerissa and myself meantime\n"+
		"Will live as maids and widows. Come, away!\n"+
		"For you shall hence upon your wedding-day:\n"+
		"Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer:\n"+
		"Since you are dear bought, I will love you dear.\n"+
		"But let me hear the letter of your friend.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"[Reads] Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all\n"+
		"miscarried, my creditors grow cruel, my estate is\n"+
		"very low, my bond to the Jew is forfeit; and since\n"+
		"in paying it, it is impossible I should live, all\n"+
		"debts are cleared between you and I, if I might but\n"+
		"see you at my death. Notwithstanding, use your\n"+
		"pleasure: if your love do not persuade you to come,\n"+
		"let not my letter.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"O love, dispatch all business, and be gone!\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"Since I have your good leave to go away,\n"+
		"I will make haste: but, till I come again,\n"+
		"No bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay,\n"+
		"No rest be interposer 'twixt us twain.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. Venice. A street.\n"+
		"Enter SHYLOCK, SALARINO, ANTONIO, and Gaoler\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"Gaoler, look to him: tell not me of mercy;\n"+
		"This is the fool that lent out money gratis:\n"+
		"Gaoler, look to him.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Hear me yet, good Shylock.\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"I'll have my bond; speak not against my bond:\n"+
		"I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond.\n"+
		"Thou call'dst me dog before thou hadst a cause;\n"+
		"But, since I am a dog, beware my fangs:\n"+
		"The duke shall grant me justice. I do wonder,\n"+
		"Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond\n"+
		"To come abroad with him at his request.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"I pray thee, hear me speak.\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"I'll have my bond; I will not hear thee speak:\n"+
		"I'll have my bond; and therefore speak no more.\n"+
		"I'll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool,\n"+
		"To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield\n"+
		"To Christian intercessors. Follow not;\n"+
		"I'll have no speaking: I will have my bond.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SALARINO\n"+
		"It is the most impenetrable cur\n"+
		"That ever kept with men.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Let him alone:\n"+
		"I'll follow him no more with bootless prayers.\n"+
		"He seeks my life; his reason well I know:\n"+
		"I oft deliver'd from his forfeitures\n"+
		"Many that have at times made moan to me;\n"+
		"Therefore he hates me.\n"+
		"SALARINO\n"+
		"I am sure the duke\n"+
		"Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"The duke cannot deny the course of law:\n"+
		"For the commodity that strangers have\n"+
		"With us in Venice, if it be denied,\n"+
		"Will much impeach the justice of his state;\n"+
		"Since that the trade and profit of the city\n"+
		"Consisteth of all nations. Therefore, go:\n"+
		"These griefs and losses have so bated me,\n"+
		"That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh\n"+
		"To-morrow to my bloody creditor.\n"+
		"Well, gaoler, on. Pray God, Bassanio come\n"+
		"To see me pay his debt, and then I care not!\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV. Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.\n"+
		"Enter PORTIA, NERISSA, LORENZO, JESSICA, and BALTHASAR\n"+
		"LORENZO\n"+
		"Madam, although I speak it in your presence,\n"+
		"You have a noble and a true conceit\n"+
		"Of godlike amity; which appears most strongly\n"+
		"In bearing thus the absence of your lord.\n"+
		"But if you knew to whom you show this honour,\n"+
		"How true a gentleman you send relief,\n"+
		"How dear a lover of my lord your husband,\n"+
		"I know you would be prouder of the work\n"+
		"Than customary bounty can enforce you.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"I never did repent for doing good,\n"+
		"Nor shall not now: for in companions\n"+
		"That do converse and waste the time together,\n"+
		"Whose souls do bear an equal yoke Of love,\n"+
		"There must be needs a like proportion\n"+
		"Of lineaments, of manners and of spirit;\n"+
		"Which makes me think that this Antonio,\n"+
		"Being the bosom lover of my lord,\n"+
		"Must needs be like my lord. If it be so,\n"+
		"How little is the cost I have bestow'd\n"+
		"In purchasing the semblance of my soul\n"+
		"From out the state of hellish misery!\n"+
		"This comes too near the praising of myself;\n"+
		"Therefore no more of it: hear other things.\n"+
		"Lorenzo, I commit into your hands\n"+
		"The husbandry and manage of my house\n"+
		"Until my lord's return: for mine own part,\n"+
		"I have toward heaven breathed a secret vow\n"+
		"To live in prayer and contemplation,\n"+
		"Only attended by Nerissa here,\n"+
		"Until her husband and my lord's return:\n"+
		"There is a monastery two miles off;\n"+
		"And there will we abide. I do desire you\n"+
		"Not to deny this imposition;\n"+
		"The which my love and some necessity\n"+
		"Now lays upon you.\n"+
		"LORENZO\n"+
		"Madam, with all my heart;\n"+
		"I shall obey you in all fair commands.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"My people do already know my mind,\n"+
		"And will acknowledge you and Jessica\n"+
		"In place of Lord Bassanio and myself.\n"+
		"And so farewell, till we shall meet again.\n"+
		"LORENZO\n"+
		"Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you!\n"+
		"JESSICA\n"+
		"I wish your ladyship all heart's content.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"I thank you for your wish, and am well pleased\n"+
		"To wish it back on you: fare you well Jessica.\n"+
		"Exeunt JESSICA and LORENZO\n"+
		"Now, Balthasar,\n"+
		"As I have ever found thee honest-true,\n"+
		"So let me find thee still. Take this same letter,\n"+
		"And use thou all the endeavour of a man\n"+
		"In speed to Padua: see thou render this\n"+
		"Into my cousin's hand, Doctor Bellario;\n"+
		"And, look, what notes and garments he doth give thee,\n"+
		"Bring them, I pray thee, with imagined speed\n"+
		"Unto the tranect, to the common ferry\n"+
		"Which trades to Venice. Waste no time in words,\n"+
		"But get thee gone: I shall be there before thee.\n"+
		"BALTHASAR\n"+
		"Madam, I go with all convenient speed.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Come on, Nerissa; I have work in hand\n"+
		"That you yet know not of: we'll see our husbands\n"+
		"Before they think of us.\n"+
		"NERISSA\n"+
		"Shall they see us?\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"They shall, Nerissa; but in such a habit,\n"+
		"That they shall think we are accomplished\n"+
		"With that we lack. I'll hold thee any wager,\n"+
		"When we are both accoutred like young men,\n"+
		"I'll prove the prettier fellow of the two,\n"+
		"And wear my dagger with the braver grace,\n"+
		"And speak between the change of man and boy\n"+
		"With a reed voice, and turn two mincing steps\n"+
		"Into a manly stride, and speak of frays\n"+
		"Like a fine bragging youth, and tell quaint lies,\n"+
		"How honourable ladies sought my love,\n"+
		"Which I denying, they fell sick and died;\n"+
		"I could not do withal; then I'll repent,\n"+
		"And wish for all that, that I had not killed them;\n"+
		"And twenty of these puny lies I'll tell,\n"+
		"That men shall swear I have discontinued school\n"+
		"Above a twelvemonth. I have within my mind\n"+
		"A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,\n"+
		"Which I will practise.\n"+
		"NERISSA\n"+
		"Why, shall we turn to men?\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Fie, what a question's that,\n"+
		"If thou wert near a lewd interpreter!\n"+
		"But come, I'll tell thee all my whole device\n"+
		"When I am in my coach, which stays for us\n"+
		"At the park gate; and therefore haste away,\n"+
		"For we must measure twenty miles to-day.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE V. The same. A garden.\n"+
		"Enter LAUNCELOT and JESSICA\n"+
		"LAUNCELOT\n"+
		"Yes, truly; for, look you, the sins of the father\n"+
		"are to be laid upon the children: therefore, I\n"+
		"promise ye, I fear you. I was always plain with\n"+
		"you, and so now I speak my agitation of the matter:\n"+
		"therefore be of good cheer, for truly I think you\n"+
		"are damned. There is but one hope in it that can do\n"+
		"you any good; and that is but a kind of bastard\n"+
		"hope neither.\n"+
		"JESSICA\n"+
		"And what hope is that, I pray thee?\n"+
		"LAUNCELOT\n"+
		"Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you\n"+
		"not, that you are not the Jew's daughter.\n"+
		"JESSICA\n"+
		"That were a kind of bastard hope, indeed: so the\n"+
		"sins of my mother should be visited upon me.\n"+
		"LAUNCELOT\n"+
		"Truly then I fear you are damned both by father and\n"+
		"mother: thus when I shun Scylla, your father, I\n"+
		"fall into Charybdis, your mother: well, you are\n"+
		"gone both ways.\n"+
		"JESSICA\n"+
		"I shall be saved by my husband; he hath made me a\n"+
		"Christian.\n"+
		"LAUNCELOT\n"+
		"Truly, the more to blame he: we were Christians\n"+
		"enow before; e'en as many as could well live, one by\n"+
		"another. This making Christians will raise the\n"+
		"price of hogs: if we grow all to be pork-eaters, we\n"+
		"shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money.\n"+
		"Enter LORENZO\n"+
		"JESSICA\n"+
		"I'll tell my husband, Launcelot, what you say: here he comes.\n"+
		"LORENZO\n"+
		"I shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelot, if\n"+
		"you thus get my wife into corners.\n"+
		"JESSICA\n"+
		"Nay, you need not fear us, Lorenzo: Launcelot and I\n"+
		"are out. He tells me flatly, there is no mercy for\n"+
		"me in heaven, because I am a Jew's daughter: and he\n"+
		"says, you are no good member of the commonwealth,\n"+
		"for in converting Jews to Christians, you raise the\n"+
		"price of pork.\n"+
		"LORENZO\n"+
		"I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than\n"+
		"you can the getting up of the negro's belly: the\n"+
		"Moor is with child by you, Launcelot.\n"+
		"LAUNCELOT\n"+
		"It is much that the Moor should be more than reason:\n"+
		"but if she be less than an honest woman, she is\n"+
		"indeed more than I took her for.\n"+
		"LORENZO\n"+
		"How every fool can play upon the word! I think the\n"+
		"best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence,\n"+
		"and discourse grow commendable in none only but\n"+
		"parrots. Go in, sirrah; bid them prepare for dinner.\n"+
		"LAUNCELOT\n"+
		"That is done, sir; they have all stomachs.\n"+
		"LORENZO\n"+
		"Goodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you! then bid\n"+
		"them prepare dinner.\n"+
		"LAUNCELOT\n"+
		"That is done too, sir; only 'cover' is the word.\n"+
		"LORENZO\n"+
		"Will you cover then, sir?\n"+
		"LAUNCELOT\n"+
		"Not so, sir, neither; I know my duty.\n"+
		"LORENZO\n"+
		"Yet more quarrelling with occasion! Wilt thou show\n"+
		"the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant? I pray\n"+
		"tree, understand a plain man in his plain meaning:\n"+
		"go to thy fellows; bid them cover the table, serve\n"+
		"in the meat, and we will come in to dinner.\n"+
		"LAUNCELOT\n"+
		"For the table, sir, it shall be served in; for the\n"+
		"meat, sir, it shall be covered; for your coming in\n"+
		"to dinner, sir, why, let it be as humours and\n"+
		"conceits shall govern.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"LORENZO\n"+
		"O dear discretion, how his words are suited!\n"+
		"The fool hath planted in his memory\n"+
		"An army of good words; and I do know\n"+
		"A many fools, that stand in better place,\n"+
		"Garnish'd like him, that for a tricksy word\n"+
		"Defy the matter. How cheerest thou, Jessica?\n"+
		"And now, good sweet, say thy opinion,\n"+
		"How dost thou like the Lord Bassanio's wife?\n"+
		"JESSICA\n"+
		"Past all expressing. It is very meet\n"+
		"The Lord Bassanio live an upright life;\n"+
		"For, having such a blessing in his lady,\n"+
		"He finds the joys of heaven here on earth;\n"+
		"And if on earth he do not mean it, then\n"+
		"In reason he should never come to heaven\n"+
		"Why, if two gods should play some heavenly match\n"+
		"And on the wager lay two earthly women,\n"+
		"And Portia one, there must be something else\n"+
		"Pawn'd with the other, for the poor rude world\n"+
		"Hath not her fellow.\n"+
		"LORENZO\n"+
		"Even such a husband\n"+
		"Hast thou of me as she is for a wife.\n"+
		"JESSICA\n"+
		"Nay, but ask my opinion too of that.\n"+
		"LORENZO\n"+
		"I will anon: first, let us go to dinner.\n"+
		"JESSICA\n"+
		"Nay, let me praise you while I have a stomach.\n"+
		"LORENZO\n"+
		"No, pray thee, let it serve for table-talk;\n"+
		"' Then, howso'er thou speak'st, 'mong other things\n"+
		"I shall digest it.\n"+
		"JESSICA\n"+
		"Well, I'll set you forth.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT IV\n"+
		"SCENE I. Venice. A court of justice.\n"+
		"Enter the DUKE, the Magnificoes, ANTONIO, BASSANIO, GRATIANO, SALERIO, and others\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"What, is Antonio here?\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Ready, so please your grace.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"I am sorry for thee: thou art come to answer\n"+
		"A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch\n"+
		"uncapable of pity, void and empty\n"+
		"From any dram of mercy.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"I have heard\n"+
		"Your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify\n"+
		"His rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate\n"+
		"And that no lawful means can carry me\n"+
		"Out of his envy's reach, I do oppose\n"+
		"My patience to his fury, and am arm'd\n"+
		"To suffer, with a quietness of spirit,\n"+
		"The very tyranny and rage of his.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"Go one, and call the Jew into the court.\n"+
		"SALERIO\n"+
		"He is ready at the door: he comes, my lord.\n"+
		"Enter SHYLOCK\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"Make room, and let him stand before our face.\n"+
		"Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,\n"+
		"That thou but lead'st this fashion of thy malice\n"+
		"To the last hour of act; and then 'tis thought\n"+
		"Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange\n"+
		"Than is thy strange apparent cruelty;\n"+
		"And where thou now exact'st the penalty,\n"+
		"Which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh,\n"+
		"Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,\n"+
		"But, touch'd with human gentleness and love,\n"+
		"Forgive a moiety of the principal;\n"+
		"Glancing an eye of pity on his losses,\n"+
		"That have of late so huddled on his back,\n"+
		"Enow to press a royal merchant down\n"+
		"And pluck commiseration of his state\n"+
		"From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,\n"+
		"From stubborn Turks and Tartars, never train'd\n"+
		"To offices of tender courtesy.\n"+
		"We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"I have possess'd your grace of what I purpose;\n"+
		"And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn\n"+
		"To have the due and forfeit of my bond:\n"+
		"If you deny it, let the danger light\n"+
		"Upon your charter and your city's freedom.\n"+
		"You'll ask me, why I rather choose to have\n"+
		"A weight of carrion flesh than to receive\n"+
		"Three thousand ducats: I'll not answer that:\n"+
		"But, say, it is my humour: is it answer'd?\n"+
		"What if my house be troubled with a rat\n"+
		"And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats\n"+
		"To have it baned? What, are you answer'd yet?\n"+
		"Some men there are love not a gaping pig;\n"+
		"Some, that are mad if they behold a cat;\n"+
		"And others, when the bagpipe sings i' the nose,\n"+
		"Cannot contain their urine: for affection,\n"+
		"Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood\n"+
		"Of what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer:\n"+
		"As there is no firm reason to be render'd,\n"+
		"Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;\n"+
		"Why he, a harmless necessary cat;\n"+
		"Why he, a woollen bagpipe; but of force\n"+
		"Must yield to such inevitable shame\n"+
		"As to offend, himself being offended;\n"+
		"So can I give no reason, nor I will not,\n"+
		"More than a lodged hate and a certain loathing\n"+
		"I bear Antonio, that I follow thus\n"+
		"A losing suit against him. Are you answer'd?\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,\n"+
		"To excuse the current of thy cruelty.\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"I am not bound to please thee with my answers.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"Do all men kill the things they do not love?\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"Hates any man the thing he would not kill?\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"Every offence is not a hate at first.\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"I pray you, think you question with the Jew:\n"+
		"You may as well go stand upon the beach\n"+
		"And bid the main flood bate his usual height;\n"+
		"You may as well use question with the wolf\n"+
		"Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;\n"+
		"You may as well forbid the mountain pines\n"+
		"To wag their high tops and to make no noise,\n"+
		"When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven;\n"+
		"You may as well do anything most hard,\n"+
		"As seek to soften that--than which what's harder?--\n"+
		"His Jewish heart: therefore, I do beseech you,\n"+
		"Make no more offers, use no farther means,\n"+
		"But with all brief and plain conveniency\n"+
		"Let me have judgment and the Jew his will.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"For thy three thousand ducats here is six.\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"What judgment shall I dread, doing\n"+
		"Were in six parts and every part a ducat,\n"+
		"I would not draw them; I would have my bond.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none?\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?\n"+
		"You have among you many a purchased slave,\n"+
		"Which, like your asses and your dogs and mules,\n"+
		"You use in abject and in slavish parts,\n"+
		"Because you bought them: shall I say to you,\n"+
		"Let them be free, marry them to your heirs?\n"+
		"Why sweat they under burthens? let their beds\n"+
		"Be made as soft as yours and let their palates\n"+
		"Be season'd with such viands? You will answer\n"+
		"'The slaves are ours:' so do I answer you:\n"+
		"The pound of flesh, which I demand of him,\n"+
		"Is dearly bought; 'tis mine and I will have it.\n"+
		"If you deny me, fie upon your law!\n"+
		"There is no force in the decrees of Venice.\n"+
		"I stand for judgment: answer; shall I have it?\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"Upon my power I may dismiss this court,\n"+
		"Unless Bellario, a learned doctor,\n"+
		"Whom I have sent for to determine this,\n"+
		"Come here to-day.\n"+
		"SALERIO\n"+
		"My lord, here stays without\n"+
		"A messenger with letters from the doctor,\n"+
		"New come from Padua.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"Bring us the letter; call the messenger.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"Good cheer, Antonio! What, man, courage yet!\n"+
		"The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones and all,\n"+
		"Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"I am a tainted wether of the flock,\n"+
		"Meetest for death: the weakest kind of fruit\n"+
		"Drops earliest to the ground; and so let me\n"+
		"You cannot better be employ'd, Bassanio,\n"+
		"Than to live still and write mine epitaph.\n"+
		"Enter NERISSA, dressed like a lawyer's clerk\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"Came you from Padua, from Bellario?\n"+
		"NERISSA\n"+
		"From both, my lord. Bellario greets your grace.\n"+
		"Presenting a letter\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew,\n"+
		"Thou makest thy knife keen; but no metal can,\n"+
		"No, not the hangman's axe, bear half the keenness\n"+
		"Of thy sharp envy. Can no prayers pierce thee?\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"O, be thou damn'd, inexecrable dog!\n"+
		"And for thy life let justice be accused.\n"+
		"Thou almost makest me waver in my faith\n"+
		"To hold opinion with Pythagoras,\n"+
		"That souls of animals infuse themselves\n"+
		"Into the trunks of men: thy currish spirit\n"+
		"Govern'd a wolf, who, hang'd for human slaughter,\n"+
		"Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,\n"+
		"And, whilst thou lay'st in thy unhallow'd dam,\n"+
		"Infused itself in thee; for thy desires\n"+
		"Are wolvish, bloody, starved and ravenous.\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond,\n"+
		"Thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud:\n"+
		"Repair thy wit, good youth, or it will fall\n"+
		"To cureless ruin. I stand here for law.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"This letter from Bellario doth commend\n"+
		"A young and learned doctor to our court.\n"+
		"Where is he?\n"+
		"NERISSA\n"+
		"He attendeth here hard by,\n"+
		"To know your answer, whether you'll admit him.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"With all my heart. Some three or four of you\n"+
		"Go give him courteous conduct to this place.\n"+
		"Meantime the court shall hear Bellario's letter.\n"+
		"Clerk\n"+
		"[Reads]\n"+
		"Your grace shall understand that at the receipt of\n"+
		"your letter I am very sick: but in the instant that\n"+
		"your messenger came, in loving visitation was with\n"+
		"me a young doctor of Rome; his name is Balthasar. I\n"+
		"acquainted him with the cause in controversy between\n"+
		"the Jew and Antonio the merchant: we turned o'er\n"+
		"many books together: he is furnished with my\n"+
		"opinion; which, bettered with his own learning, the\n"+
		"greatness whereof I cannot enough commend, comes\n"+
		"with him, at my importunity, to fill up your grace's\n"+
		"request in my stead. I beseech you, let his lack of\n"+
		"years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend\n"+
		"estimation; for I never knew so young a body with so\n"+
		"old a head. I leave him to your gracious\n"+
		"acceptance, whose trial shall better publish his\n"+
		"commendation.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"You hear the learn'd Bellario, what he writes:\n"+
		"And here, I take it, is the doctor come.\n"+
		"Enter PORTIA, dressed like a doctor of laws\n"+
		"Give me your hand. Come you from old Bellario?\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"I did, my lord.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"You are welcome: take your place.\n"+
		"Are you acquainted with the difference\n"+
		"That holds this present question in the court?\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"I am informed thoroughly of the cause.\n"+
		"Which is the merchant here, and which the Jew?\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Is your name Shylock?\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"Shylock is my name.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Of a strange nature is the suit you follow;\n"+
		"Yet in such rule that the Venetian law\n"+
		"Cannot impugn you as you do proceed.\n"+
		"You stand within his danger, do you not?\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Ay, so he says.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Do you confess the bond?\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"I do.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Then must the Jew be merciful.\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"On what compulsion must I? tell me that.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"The quality of mercy is not strain'd,\n"+
		"It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven\n"+
		"Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest;\n"+
		"It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:\n"+
		"'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes\n"+
		"The throned monarch better than his crown;\n"+
		"His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,\n"+
		"The attribute to awe and majesty,\n"+
		"Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;\n"+
		"But mercy is above this sceptred sway;\n"+
		"It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,\n"+
		"It is an attribute to God himself;\n"+
		"And earthly power doth then show likest God's\n"+
		"When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,\n"+
		"Though justice be thy plea, consider this,\n"+
		"That, in the course of justice, none of us\n"+
		"Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;\n"+
		"And that same prayer doth teach us all to render\n"+
		"The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much\n"+
		"To mitigate the justice of thy plea;\n"+
		"Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice\n"+
		"Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"My deeds upon my head! I crave the law,\n"+
		"The penalty and forfeit of my bond.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Is he not able to discharge the money?\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"Yes, here I tender it for him in the court;\n"+
		"Yea, twice the sum: if that will not suffice,\n"+
		"I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er,\n"+
		"On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart:\n"+
		"If this will not suffice, it must appear\n"+
		"That malice bears down truth. And I beseech you,\n"+
		"Wrest once the law to your authority:\n"+
		"To do a great right, do a little wrong,\n"+
		"And curb this cruel devil of his will.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"It must not be; there is no power in Venice\n"+
		"Can alter a decree established:\n"+
		"'Twill be recorded for a precedent,\n"+
		"And many an error by the same example\n"+
		"Will rush into the state: it cannot be.\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"A Daniel come to judgment! yea, a Daniel!\n"+
		"O wise young judge, how I do honour thee!\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"I pray you, let me look upon the bond.\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"Here 'tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Shylock, there's thrice thy money offer'd thee.\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"An oath, an oath, I have an oath in heaven:\n"+
		"Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?\n"+
		"No, not for Venice.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Why, this bond is forfeit;\n"+
		"And lawfully by this the Jew may claim\n"+
		"A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off\n"+
		"Nearest the merchant's heart. Be merciful:\n"+
		"Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"When it is paid according to the tenor.\n"+
		"It doth appear you are a worthy judge;\n"+
		"You know the law, your exposition\n"+
		"Hath been most sound: I charge you by the law,\n"+
		"Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,\n"+
		"Proceed to judgment: by my soul I swear\n"+
		"There is no power in the tongue of man\n"+
		"To alter me: I stay here on my bond.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Most heartily I do beseech the court\n"+
		"To give the judgment.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Why then, thus it is:\n"+
		"You must prepare your bosom for his knife.\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"O noble judge! O excellent young man!\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"For the intent and purpose of the law\n"+
		"Hath full relation to the penalty,\n"+
		"Which here appeareth due upon the bond.\n"+

		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Therefore lay bare your bosom.\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"Ay, his breast:\n"+
		"So says the bond: doth it not, noble judge?\n"+
		"'Nearest his heart:' those are the very words.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"It is so. Are there balance here to weigh\n"+
		"The flesh?\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"I have them ready.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,\n"+
		"To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death.\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"Is it so nominated in the bond?\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"It is not so express'd: but what of that?\n"+
		"'Twere good you do so much for charity.\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"I cannot find it; 'tis not in the bond.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"You, merchant, have you any thing to say?\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"But little: I am arm'd and well prepared.\n"+
		"Give me your hand, Bassanio: fare you well!\n"+
		"Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you;\n"+
		"For herein Fortune shows herself more kind\n"+
		"Than is her custom: it is still her use\n"+
		"To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,\n"+
		"To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow\n"+
		"An age of poverty; from which lingering penance\n"+
		"Of such misery doth she cut me off.\n"+
		"Commend me to your honourable wife:\n"+
		"Tell her the process of Antonio's end;\n"+
		"Say how I loved you, speak me fair in death;\n"+
		"And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge\n"+
		"Whether Bassanio had not once a love.\n"+
		"Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,\n"+
		"And he repents not that he pays your debt;\n"+
		"For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,\n"+
		"I'll pay it presently with all my heart.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"Antonio, I am married to a wife\n"+
		"Which is as dear to me as life itself;\n"+
		"But life itself, my wife, and all the world,\n"+
		"Are not with me esteem'd above thy life:\n"+
		"I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all\n"+
		"Here to this devil, to deliver you.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Your wife would give you little thanks for that,\n"+
		"If she were by, to hear you make the offer.\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"I have a wife, whom, I protest, I love:\n"+
		"I would she were in heaven, so she could\n"+

		"These be the Christian husbands. I have a daughter;\n"+
		"Would any of the stock of Barrabas\n"+
		"Had been her husband rather than a Christian!\n"+
		"Aside\n"+
		"We trifle time: I pray thee, pursue sentence.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"A pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine:\n"+
		"The court awards it, and the law doth give it.\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"Most rightful judge!\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"And you must cut this flesh from off his breast:\n"+
		"The law allows it, and the court awards it.\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"Most learned judge! A sentence! Come, prepare!\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Tarry a little; there is something else.\n"+
		"This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood;\n"+
		"The words expressly are 'a pound of flesh:'\n"+
		"Take then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh;\n"+
		"But, in the cutting it, if thou dost shed\n"+
		"One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods\n"+
		"Are, by the laws of Venice, confiscate\n"+
		"Unto the state of Venice.\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"O upright judge! Mark, Jew: O learned judge!\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"Is that the law?\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Thyself shalt see the act:\n"+
		"For, as thou urgest justice, be assured\n"+
		"Thou shalt have justice, more than thou desirest.\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"O learned judge! Mark, Jew: a learned judge!\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"I take this offer, then; pay the bond thrice\n"+
		"And let the Christian go.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"Here is the money.\n"+

		"He shall have nothing but the penalty.\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"O Jew! an upright judge, a learned judge!\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh.\n"+
		"Shed thou no blood, nor cut thou less nor more\n"+
		"But just a pound of flesh: if thou cut'st more\n"+
		"Or less than a just pound, be it but so much\n"+
		"As makes it light or heavy in the substance,\n"+
		"Or the division of the twentieth part\n"+
		"Of one poor scruple, nay, if the scale do turn\n"+
		"But in the estimation of a hair,\n"+
		"Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate.\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew!\n"+
		"Now, infidel, I have you on the hip.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Why doth the Jew pause? take thy forfeiture.\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"Give me my principal, and let me go.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"I have it ready for thee; here it is.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"He hath refused it in the open court:\n"+
		"He shall have merely justice and his bond.\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"A Daniel, still say I, a second Daniel!\n"+
		"I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word.\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"Shall I not have barely my principal?\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture,\n"+
		"To be so taken at thy peril, Jew.\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"Why, then the devil give him good of it!\n"+
		"I'll stay no longer question.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Tarry, Jew:\n"+
		"The law hath yet another hold on you.\n"+
		"It is enacted in the laws of Venice,\n"+
		"If it be proved against an alien\n"+
		"That by direct or indirect attempts\n"+
		"He seek the life of any citizen,\n"+
		"The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive\n"+
		"Shall seize one half his goods; the other half\n"+
		"Comes to the privy coffer of the state;\n"+
		"And the offender's life lies in the mercy\n"+
		"Of the duke only, 'gainst all other voice.\n"+
		"In which predicament, I say, thou stand'st;\n"+
		"For it appears, by manifest proceeding,\n"+
		"That indirectly and directly too\n"+
		"Thou hast contrived against the very life\n"+
		"Of the defendant; and thou hast incurr'd\n"+
		"The danger formerly by me rehearsed.\n"+
		"Down therefore and beg mercy of the duke.\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself:\n"+
		"And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state,\n"+
		"Thou hast not left the value of a cord;\n"+
		"Therefore thou must be hang'd at the state's charge.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"That thou shalt see the difference of our spirits,\n"+
		"I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it:\n"+
		"For half thy wealth, it is Antonio's;\n"+
		"The other half comes to the general state,\n"+
		"Which humbleness may drive unto a fine.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Ay, for the state, not for Antonio.\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"Nay, take my life and all; pardon not that:\n"+
		"You take my house when you do take the prop\n"+
		"That doth sustain my house; you take my life\n"+
		"When you do take the means whereby I live.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"What mercy can you render him, Antonio?\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"A halter gratis; nothing else, for God's sake.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"So please my lord the duke and all the court\n"+
		"To quit the fine for one half of his goods,\n"+
		"I am content; so he will let me have\n"+
		"The other half in use, to render it,\n"+
		"Upon his death, unto the gentleman\n"+
		"That lately stole his daughter:\n"+
		"Two things provided more, that, for this favour,\n"+
		"He presently become a Christian;\n"+
		"The other, that he do record a gift,\n"+
		"Here in the court, of all he dies possess'd,\n"+
		"Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"He shall do this, or else I do recant\n"+
		"The pardon that I late pronounced here.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Art thou contented, Jew? what dost thou say?\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"I am content.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Clerk, draw a deed of gift.\n"+
		"SHYLOCK\n"+
		"I pray you, give me leave to go from hence;\n"+
		"I am not well: send the deed after me,\n"+
		"And I will sign it.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"Get thee gone, but do it.\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"In christening shalt thou have two god-fathers:\n"+
		"Had I been judge, thou shouldst have had ten more,\n"+
		"To bring thee to the gallows, not the font.\n"+
		"Exit SHYLOCK\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"Sir, I entreat you home with me to dinner.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"I humbly do desire your grace of pardon:\n"+
		"I must away this night toward Padua,\n"+
		"And it is meet I presently set forth.\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"I am sorry that your leisure serves you not.\n"+
		"Antonio, gratify this gentleman,\n"+
		"For, in my mind, you are much bound to him.\n"+
		"Exeunt Duke and his train\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend\n"+
		"Have by your wisdom been this day acquitted\n"+
		"Of grievous penalties; in lieu whereof,\n"+
		"Three thousand ducats, due unto the Jew,\n"+
		"We freely cope your courteous pains withal.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"And stand indebted, over and above,\n"+
		"In love and service to you evermore.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"He is well paid that is well satisfied;\n"+
		"And I, delivering you, am satisfied\n"+
		"And therein do account myself well paid:\n"+
		"My mind was never yet more mercenary.\n"+
		"I pray you, know me when we meet again:\n"+
		"I wish you well, and so I take my leave.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"Dear sir, of force I must attempt you further:\n"+
		"Take some remembrance of us, as a tribute,\n"+
		"Not as a fee: grant me two things, I pray you,\n"+
		"Not to deny me, and to pardon me.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"You press me far, and therefore I will yield.\n"+
		"To ANTONIO\n"+
		"Give me your gloves, I'll wear them for your sake;\n"+
		"To BASSANIO\n"+
		"And, for your love, I'll take this ring from you:\n"+
		"Do not draw back your hand; I'll take no more;\n"+
		"And you in love shall not deny me this.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"This ring, good sir, alas, it is a trifle!\n"+
		"I will not shame myself to give you this.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"I will have nothing else but only this;\n"+
		"And now methinks I have a mind to it.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"There's more depends on this than on the value.\n"+
		"The dearest ring in Venice will I give you,\n"+
		"And find it out by proclamation:\n"+
		"Only for this, I pray you, pardon me.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"I see, sir, you are liberal in offers\n"+
		"You taught me first to beg; and now methinks\n"+
		"You teach me how a beggar should be answer'd.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife;\n"+
		"And when she put it on, she made me vow\n"+
		"That I should neither sell nor give nor lose it.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"That 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts.\n"+
		"An if your wife be not a mad-woman,\n"+
		"And know how well I have deserved the ring,\n"+
		"She would not hold out enemy for ever,\n"+
		"For giving it to me. Well, peace be with you!\n"+
		"Exeunt Portia and Nerissa\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring:\n"+
		"Let his deservings and my love withal\n"+
		"Be valued against your wife's commandment.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"Go, Gratiano, run and overtake him;\n"+
		"Give him the ring, and bring him, if thou canst,\n"+
		"Unto Antonio's house: away! make haste.\n"+
		"Exit Gratiano\n"+
		"Come, you and I will thither presently;\n"+
		"And in the morning early will we both\n"+
		"Fly toward Belmont: come, Antonio.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. The same. A street.\n"+
		"Enter PORTIA and NERISSA\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Inquire the Jew's house out, give him this deed\n"+
		"And let him sign it: we'll away to-night\n"+
		"And be a day before our husbands home:\n"+
		"This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo.\n"+
		"Enter GRATIANO\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"Fair sir, you are well o'erta'en\n"+
		"My Lord Bassanio upon more advice\n"+
		"Hath sent you here this ring, and doth entreat\n"+
		"Your company at dinner.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"That cannot be:\n"+
		"His ring I do accept most thankfully:\n"+
		"And so, I pray you, tell him: furthermore,\n"+
		"I pray you, show my youth old Shylock's house.\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"That will I do.\n"+
		"NERISSA\n"+
		"Sir, I would speak with you.\n"+
		"Aside to PORTIA\n"+
		"I'll see if I can get my husband's ring,\n"+
		"Which I did make him swear to keep for ever.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"[Aside to NERISSA] Thou mayst, I warrant.\n"+
		"We shall have old swearing\n"+
		"That they did give the rings away to men;\n"+
		"But we'll outface them, and outswear them too.\n"+
		"Aloud\n"+
		"Away! make haste: thou knowist where I will tarry.\n"+
		"NERISSA\n"+
		"Come, good sir, will you show me to this house?\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT V\n"+
		"SCENE I. Belmont. Avenue to PORTIA'S house.\n"+
		"Enter LORENZO and JESSICA\n"+
		"LORENZO\n"+
		"The moon shines bright: in such a night as this,\n"+
		"When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees\n"+
		"And they did make no noise, in such a night\n"+
		"Troilus methinks mounted the Troyan walls\n"+
		"And sigh'd his soul toward the Grecian tents,\n"+
		"Where Cressid lay that night.\n"+
		"JESSICA\n"+
		"In such a night\n"+
		"Did Thisbe fearfully o'ertrip the dew\n"+
		"And saw the lion's shadow ere himself\n"+
		"And ran dismay'd away.\n"+
		"LORENZO\n"+
		"In such a night\n"+
		"Stood Dido with a willow in her hand\n"+
		"Upon the wild sea banks and waft her love\n"+
		"To come again to Carthage.\n"+
		"JESSICA\n"+
		"In such a night\n"+
		"Medea gather'd the enchanted herbs\n"+
		"That did renew old AEson.\n"+
		"LORENZO\n"+
		"In such a night\n"+
		"Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew\n"+
		"And with an unthrift love did run from Venice\n"+
		"As far as Belmont.\n"+
		"JESSICA\n"+
		"In such a night\n"+
		"Did young Lorenzo swear he loved her well,\n"+
		"Stealing her soul with many vows of faith\n"+
		"And ne'er a true one.\n"+
		"LORENZO\n"+
		"In such a night\n"+
		"Did pretty Jessica, like a little shrew,\n"+
		"Slander her love, and he forgave it her.\n"+
		"JESSICA\n"+
		"I would out-night you, did no body come;\n"+
		"But, hark, I hear the footing of a man.\n"+
		"Enter STEPHANO\n"+
		"LORENZO\n"+
		"Who comes so fast in silence of the night?\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"A friend.\n"+
		"LORENZO\n"+
		"A friend! what friend? your name, I pray you, friend?\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"Stephano is my name; and I bring word\n"+
		"My mistress will before the break of day\n"+
		"Be here at Belmont; she doth stray about\n"+
		"By holy crosses, where she kneels and prays\n"+
		"For happy wedlock hours.\n"+
		"LORENZO\n"+
		"Who comes with her?\n"+
		"STEPHANO\n"+
		"None but a holy hermit and her maid.\n"+
		"I pray you, is my master yet return'd?\n"+
		"LORENZO\n"+
		"He is not, nor we have not heard from him.\n"+
		"But go we in, I pray thee, Jessica,\n"+
		"And ceremoniously let us prepare\n"+
		"Some welcome for the mistress of the house.\n"+
		"Enter LAUNCELOT\n"+
		"LAUNCELOT\n"+
		"Sola, sola! wo ha, ho! sola, sola!\n"+
		"LORENZO\n"+
		"Who calls?\n"+
		"LAUNCELOT\n"+
		"Sola! did you see Master Lorenzo?\n"+
		"Master Lorenzo, sola, sola!\n"+
		"LORENZO\n"+
		"Leave hollaing, man: here.\n"+
		"LAUNCELOT\n"+
		"Sola! where? where?\n"+
		"LORENZO\n"+
		"Here.\n"+
		"LAUNCELOT\n"+
		"Tell him there's a post come from my master, with\n"+
		"his horn full of good news: my master will be here\n"+
		"ere morning.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"LORENZO\n"+
		"Sweet soul, let's in, and there expect their coming.\n"+
		"And yet no matter: why should we go in?\n"+
		"My friend Stephano, signify, I pray you,\n"+
		"Within the house, your mistress is at hand;\n"+
		"And bring your music forth into the air.\n"+
		"Exit Stephano\n"+
		"How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!\n"+
		"Here will we sit and let the sounds of music\n"+
		"Creep in our ears: soft stillness and the night\n"+
		"Become the touches of sweet harmony.\n"+
		"Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven\n"+
		"Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold:\n"+
		"There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st\n"+
		"But in his motion like an angel sings,\n"+
		"Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins;\n"+
		"Such harmony is in immortal souls;\n"+
		"But whilst this muddy vesture of decay\n"+
		"Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.\n"+
		"Enter Musicians\n"+
		"Come, ho! and wake Diana with a hymn!\n"+
		"With sweetest touches pierce your mistress' ear,\n"+
		"And draw her home with music.\n"+
		"Music\n"+
		"JESSICA\n"+
		"I am never merry when I hear sweet music.\n"+
		"LORENZO\n"+
		"The reason is, your spirits are attentive:\n"+
		"For do but note a wild and wanton herd,\n"+
		"Or race of youthful and unhandled colts,\n"+
		"Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,\n"+
		"Which is the hot condition of their blood;\n"+
		"If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,\n"+
		"Or any air of music touch their ears,\n"+
		"You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,\n"+
		"Their savage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze\n"+
		"By the sweet power of music: therefore the poet\n"+
		"Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones and floods;\n"+
		"Since nought so stockish, hard and full of rage,\n"+
		"But music for the time doth change his nature.\n"+
		"The man that hath no music in himself,\n"+
		"Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,\n"+
		"Is fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils;\n"+
		"The motions of his spirit are dull as night\n"+
		"And his affections dark as Erebus:\n"+
		"Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.\n"+
		"Enter PORTIA and NERISSA\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"That light we see is burning in my hall.\n"+
		"How far that little candle throws his beams!\n"+
		"So shines a good deed in a naughty world.\n"+
		"NERISSA\n"+
		"When the moon shone, we did not see the candle.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"So doth the greater glory dim the less:\n"+
		"A substitute shines brightly as a king\n"+
		"Unto the king be by, and then his state\n"+
		"Empties itself, as doth an inland brook\n"+
		"Into the main of waters. Music! hark!\n"+
		"NERISSA\n"+
		"It is your music, madam, of the house.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Nothing is good, I see, without respect:\n"+
		"Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.\n"+
		"NERISSA\n"+
		"Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark,\n"+
		"When neither is attended, and I think\n"+
		"The nightingale, if she should sing by day,\n"+
		"When every goose is cackling, would be thought\n"+
		"No better a musician than the wren.\n"+
		"How many things by season season'd are\n"+
		"To their right praise and true perfection!\n"+
		"Peace, ho! the moon sleeps with Endymion\n"+
		"And would not be awaked.\n"+
		"Music ceases\n"+
		"LORENZO\n"+
		"That is the voice,\n"+
		"Or I am much deceived, of Portia.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo,\n"+
		"By the bad voice.\n"+
		"LORENZO\n"+
		"Dear lady, welcome home.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"We have been praying for our husbands' healths,\n"+
		"Which speed, we hope, the better for our words.\n"+
		"Are they return'd?\n"+
		"LORENZO\n"+
		"Madam, they are not yet;\n"+
		"But there is come a messenger before,\n"+
		"To signify their coming.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Go in, Nerissa;\n"+
		"Give order to my servants that they take\n"+
		"No note at all of our being absent hence;\n"+
		"Nor you, Lorenzo; Jessica, nor you.\n"+
		"A tucket sounds\n"+
		"LORENZO\n"+
		"Your husband is at hand; I hear his trumpet:\n"+
		"We are no tell-tales, madam; fear you not.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"This night methinks is but the daylight sick;\n"+
		"It looks a little paler: 'tis a day,\n"+
		"Such as the day is when the sun is hid.\n"+
		"Enter BASSANIO, ANTONIO, GRATIANO, and their followers\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"We should hold day with the Antipodes,\n"+
		"If you would walk in absence of the sun.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Let me give light, but let me not be light;\n"+
		"For a light wife doth make a heavy husband,\n"+
		"And never be Bassanio so for me:\n"+
		"But God sort all! You are welcome home, my lord.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"I thank you, madam. Give welcome to my friend.\n"+
		"This is the man, this is Antonio,\n"+
		"To whom I am so infinitely bound.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"You should in all sense be much bound to him.\n"+
		"For, as I hear, he was much bound for you.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"No more than I am well acquitted of.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Sir, you are very welcome to our house:\n"+
		"It must appear in other ways than words,\n"+
		"Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"[To NERISSA] By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong;\n"+
		"In faith, I gave it to the judge's clerk:\n"+
		"Would he were gelt that had it, for my part,\n"+
		"Since you do take it, love, so much at heart.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"A quarrel, ho, already! what's the matter?\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring\n"+
		"That she did give me, whose posy was\n"+
		"For all the world like cutler's poetry\n"+
		"Upon a knife, 'Love me, and leave me not.'\n"+
		"NERISSA\n"+
		"What talk you of the posy or the value?\n"+
		"You swore to me, when I did give it you,\n"+
		"That you would wear it till your hour of death\n"+
		"And that it should lie with you in your grave:\n"+
		"Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,\n"+
		"You should have been respective and have kept it.\n"+
		"Gave it a judge's clerk! no, God's my judge,\n"+
		"The clerk will ne'er wear hair on's face that had it.\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"He will, an if he live to be a man.\n"+
		"NERISSA\n"+
		"Ay, if a woman live to be a man.\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,\n"+
		"A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy,\n"+
		"No higher than thyself; the judge's clerk,\n"+
		"A prating boy, that begg'd it as a fee:\n"+
		"I could not for my heart deny it him.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"You were to blame, I must be plain with you,\n"+
		"To part so slightly with your wife's first gift:\n"+
		"A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger\n"+
		"And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.\n"+
		"I gave my love a ring and made him swear\n"+
		"Never to part with it; and here he stands;\n"+
		"I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it\n"+
		"Nor pluck it from his finger, for the wealth\n"+
		"That the world masters. Now, in faith, Gratiano,\n"+
		"You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief:\n"+
		"An 'twere to me, I should be mad at it.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"[Aside] Why, I were best to cut my left hand off\n"+
		"And swear I lost the ring defending it.\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away\n"+
		"Unto the judge that begg'd it and indeed\n"+
		"Deserved it too; and then the boy, his clerk,\n"+
		"That took some pains in writing, he begg'd mine;\n"+
		"And neither man nor master would take aught\n"+
		"But the two rings.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"What ring gave you my lord?\n"+
		"Not that, I hope, which you received of me.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"If I could add a lie unto a fault,\n"+
		"I would deny it; but you see my finger\n"+
		"Hath not the ring upon it; it is gone.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Even so void is your false heart of truth.\n"+
		"By heaven, I will ne'er come in your bed\n"+
		"Until I see the ring.\n"+
		"NERISSA\n"+
		"Nor I in yours\n"+
		"Till I again see mine.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"Sweet Portia,\n"+
		"If you did know to whom I gave the ring,\n"+
		"If you did know for whom I gave the ring\n"+
		"And would conceive for what I gave the ring\n"+
		"And how unwillingly I left the ring,\n"+
		"When nought would be accepted but the ring,\n"+
		"You would abate the strength of your displeasure.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"If you had known the virtue of the ring,\n"+
		"Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,\n"+
		"Or your own honour to contain the ring,\n"+
		"You would not then have parted with the ring.\n"+
		"What man is there so much unreasonable,\n"+
		"If you had pleased to have defended it\n"+
		"With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty\n"+
		"To urge the thing held as a ceremony?\n"+
		"Nerissa teaches me what to believe:\n"+
		"I'll die for't but some woman had the ring.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"No, by my honour, madam, by my soul,\n"+
		"No woman had it, but a civil doctor,\n"+
		"Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me\n"+
		"And begg'd the ring; the which I did deny him\n"+
		"And suffer'd him to go displeased away;\n"+
		"Even he that did uphold the very life\n"+
		"Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady?\n"+
		"I was enforced to send it after him;\n"+
		"I was beset with shame and courtesy;\n"+
		"My honour would not let ingratitude\n"+
		"So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady;\n"+
		"For, by these blessed candles of the night,\n"+
		"Had you been there, I think you would have begg'd\n"+
		"The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Let not that doctor e'er come near my house:\n"+
		"Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,\n"+
		"And that which you did swear to keep for me,\n"+
		"I will become as liberal as you;\n"+
		"I'll not deny him any thing I have,\n"+
		"No, not my body nor my husband's bed:\n"+
		"Know him I shall, I am well sure of it:\n"+
		"Lie not a night from home; watch me like Argus:\n"+
		"If you do not, if I be left alone,\n"+
		"Now, by mine honour, which is yet mine own,\n"+
		"I'll have that doctor for my bedfellow.\n"+
		"NERISSA\n"+
		"And I his clerk; therefore be well advised\n"+
		"How you do leave me to mine own protection.\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"Well, do you so; let not me take him, then;\n"+
		"For if I do, I'll mar the young clerk's pen.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"I am the unhappy subject of these quarrels.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Sir, grieve not you; you are welcome notwithstanding.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong;\n"+
		"And, in the hearing of these many friends,\n"+
		"I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,\n"+
		"Wherein I see myself--\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Mark you but that!\n"+
		"In both my eyes he doubly sees himself;\n"+
		"In each eye, one: swear by your double self,\n"+
		"And there's an oath of credit.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"Nay, but hear me:\n"+
		"Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear\n"+
		"I never more will break an oath with thee.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"I once did lend my body for his wealth;\n"+
		"Which, but for him that had your husband's ring,\n"+
		"Had quite miscarried: I dare be bound again,\n"+
		"My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord\n"+
		"Will never more break faith advisedly.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Then you shall be his surety. Give him this\n"+
		"And bid him keep it better than the other.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Here, Lord Bassanio; swear to keep this ring.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"I had it of him: pardon me, Bassanio;\n"+
		"For, by this ring, the doctor lay with me.\n"+
		"NERISSA\n"+
		"And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano;\n"+
		"For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor's clerk,\n"+
		"In lieu of this last night did lie with me.\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"Why, this is like the mending of highways\n"+
		"In summer, where the ways are fair enough:\n"+
		"What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it?\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"Speak not so grossly. You are all amazed:\n"+
		"Here is a letter; read it at your leisure;\n"+
		"It comes from Padua, from Bellario:\n"+
		"There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,\n"+
		"Nerissa there her clerk: Lorenzo here\n"+
		"Shall witness I set forth as soon as you\n"+
		"And even but now return'd; I have not yet\n"+
		"Enter'd my house. Antonio, you are welcome;\n"+
		"And I have better news in store for you\n"+
		"Than you expect: unseal this letter soon;\n"+
		"There you shall find three of your argosies\n"+
		"Are richly come to harbour suddenly:\n"+
		"You shall not know by what strange accident\n"+
		"I chanced on this letter.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"I am dumb.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"Were you the doctor and I knew you not?\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?\n"+
		"NERISSA\n"+
		"Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it,\n"+
		"Unless he live until he be a man.\n"+
		"BASSANIO\n"+
		"Sweet doctor, you shall be my bed-fellow:\n"+
		"When I am absent, then lie with my wife.\n"+
		"ANTONIO\n"+
		"Sweet lady, you have given me life and living;\n"+
		"For here I read for certain that my ships\n"+
		"Are safely come to road.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"How now, Lorenzo!\n"+
		"My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.\n"+
		"NERISSA\n"+
		"Ay, and I'll give them him without a fee.\n"+
		"There do I give to you and Jessica,\n"+
		"From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,\n"+
		"After his death, of all he dies possess'd of.\n"+
		"LORENZO\n"+
		"Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way\n"+
		"Of starved people.\n"+
		"PORTIA\n"+
		"It is almost morning,\n"+
		"And yet I am sure you are not satisfied\n"+
		"Of these events at full. Let us go in;\n"+
		"And charge us there upon inter'gatories,\n"+
		"And we will answer all things faithfully.\n"+
		"GRATIANO\n"+
		"Let it be so: the first inter'gatory\n"+
		"That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is,\n"+
		"Whether till the next night she had rather stay,\n"+
		"Or go to bed now, being two hours to day:\n"+
		"But were the day come, I should wish it dark,\n"+
		"That I were couching with the doctor's clerk.\n"+
		"Well, while I live I'll fear no other thing\n"+
		"So sore as keeping safe Nerissa's ring.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"
