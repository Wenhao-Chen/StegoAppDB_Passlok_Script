		"ACT I\n"+
		"SCENE I. An apartment in the DUKE'S palace.\n"+
		"Enter DUKE VINCENTIO, ESCALUS, Lords and Attendants\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Escalus.\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"My lord.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Of government the properties to unfold,\n"+
		"Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse;\n"+
		"Since I am put to know that your own science\n"+
		"Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice\n"+
		"My strength can give you: then no more remains,\n"+
		"But that to your sufficiency as your Worth is able,\n"+
		"And let them work. The nature of our people,\n"+
		"Our city's institutions, and the terms\n"+
		"For common justice, you're as pregnant in\n"+
		"As art and practise hath enriched any\n"+
		"That we remember. There is our commission,\n"+
		"From which we would not have you warp. Call hither,\n"+
		"I say, bid come before us Angelo.\n"+
		"Exit an Attendant\n"+
		"What figure of us think you he will bear?\n"+
		"For you must know, we have with special soul\n"+
		"Elected him our absence to supply,\n"+
		"Lent him our terror, dress'd him with our love,\n"+
		"And given his deputation all the organs\n"+
		"Of our own power: what think you of it?\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"If any in Vienna be of worth\n"+
		"To undergo such ample grace and honour,\n"+
		"It is Lord Angelo.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Look where he comes.\n"+
		"Enter ANGELO\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Always obedient to your grace's will,\n"+
		"I come to know your pleasure.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Angelo,\n"+
		"There is a kind of character in thy life,\n"+
		"That to the observer doth thy history\n"+
		"Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings\n"+
		"Are not thine own so proper as to waste\n"+
		"Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.\n"+
		"Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,\n"+
		"Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues\n"+
		"Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike\n"+
		"As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd\n"+
		"But to fine issues, nor Nature never lends\n"+
		"The smallest scruple of her excellence\n"+
		"But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines\n"+
		"Herself the glory of a creditor,\n"+
		"Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech\n"+
		"To one that can my part in him advertise;\n"+
		"Hold therefore, Angelo:--\n"+
		"In our remove be thou at full ourself;\n"+
		"Mortality and mercy in Vienna\n"+
		"Live in thy tongue and heart: old Escalus,\n"+
		"Though first in question, is thy secondary.\n"+
		"Take thy commission.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Now, good my lord,\n"+
		"Let there be some more test made of my metal,\n"+
		"Before so noble and so great a figure\n"+
		"Be stamp'd upon it.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"No more evasion:\n"+
		"We have with a leaven'd and prepared choice\n"+
		"Proceeded to you; therefore take your honours.\n"+
		"Our haste from hence is of so quick condition\n"+
		"That it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'd\n"+
		"Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,\n"+
		"As time and our concernings shall importune,\n"+
		"How it goes with us, and do look to know\n"+
		"What doth befall you here. So, fare you well;\n"+
		"To the hopeful execution do I leave you\n"+
		"Of your commissions.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Yet give leave, my lord,\n"+
		"That we may bring you something on the way.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"My haste may not admit it;\n"+
		"Nor need you, on mine honour, have to do\n"+
		"With any scruple; your scope is as mine own\n"+
		"So to enforce or qualify the laws\n"+
		"As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand:\n"+
		"I'll privily away. I love the people,\n"+
		"But do not like to stage me to their eyes:\n"+
		"Through it do well, I do not relish well\n"+
		"Their loud applause and Aves vehement;\n"+
		"Nor do I think the man of safe discretion\n"+
		"That does affect it. Once more, fare you well.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"The heavens give safety to your purposes!\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"Lead forth and bring you back in happiness!\n"+
		"DUKE\n"+
		"I thank you. Fare you well.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"I shall desire you, sir, to give me leave\n"+
		"To have free speech with you; and it concerns me\n"+
		"To look into the bottom of my place:\n"+
		"A power I have, but of what strength and nature\n"+
		"I am not yet instructed.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,\n"+
		"And we may soon our satisfaction have\n"+
		"Touching that point.\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"I'll wait upon your honour.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. A Street.\n"+
		"Enter LUCIO and two Gentlemen\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"If the duke with the other dukes come not to\n"+
		"composition with the King of Hungary, why then all\n"+
		"the dukes fall upon the king.\n"+
		"First Gentleman\n"+
		"Heaven grant us its peace, but not the King of\n"+
		"Hungary's!\n"+
		"Second Gentleman\n"+
		"Amen.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"Thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate, that\n"+
		"went to sea with the Ten Commandments, but scraped\n"+
		"one out of the table.\n"+
		"Second Gentleman\n"+
		"'Thou shalt not steal'?\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"Ay, that he razed.\n"+
		"First Gentleman\n"+
		"Why, 'twas a commandment to command the captain and\n"+
		"all the rest from their functions: they put forth\n"+
		"to steal. There's not a soldier of us all, that, in\n"+
		"the thanksgiving before meat, do relish the petition\n"+
		"well that prays for peace.\n"+
		"Second Gentleman\n"+
		"I never heard any soldier dislike it.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"I believe thee; for I think thou never wast where\n"+
		"grace was said.\n"+
		"Second Gentleman\n"+
		"No? a dozen times at least.\n"+
		"First Gentleman\n"+
		"What, in metre?\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"In any proportion or in any language.\n"+
		"First Gentleman\n"+
		"I think, or in any religion.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"Ay, why not? Grace is grace, despite of all\n"+
		"controversy: as, for example, thou thyself art a\n"+
		"wicked villain, despite of all grace.\n"+
		"First Gentleman\n"+
		"Well, there went but a pair of shears between us.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"I grant; as there may between the lists and the\n"+
		"velvet. Thou art the list.\n"+
		"First Gentleman\n"+
		"And thou the velvet: thou art good velvet; thou'rt\n"+
		"a three-piled piece, I warrant thee: I had as lief\n"+
		"be a list of an English kersey as be piled, as thou\n"+
		"art piled, for a French velvet. Do I speak\n"+
		"feelingly now?\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"I think thou dost; and, indeed, with most painful\n"+
		"feeling of thy speech: I will, out of thine own\n"+
		"confession, learn to begin thy health; but, whilst I\n"+
		"live, forget to drink after thee.\n"+
		"First Gentleman\n"+
		"I think I have done myself wrong, have I not?\n"+
		"Second Gentleman\n"+
		"Yes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or free.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"Behold, behold. where Madam Mitigation comes! I\n"+
		"have purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to--\n"+
		"Second Gentleman\n"+
		"To what, I pray?\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"Judge.\n"+
		"Second Gentleman\n"+
		"To three thousand dolours a year.\n"+
		"First Gentleman\n"+
		"Ay, and more.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"A French crown more.\n"+
		"First Gentleman\n"+
		"Thou art always figuring diseases in me; but thou\n"+
		"art full of error; I am sound.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"Nay, not as one would say, healthy; but so sound as\n"+
		"things that are hollow: thy bones are hollow;\n"+
		"impiety has made a feast of thee.\n"+
		"Enter MISTRESS OVERDONE\n"+
		"First Gentleman\n"+
		"How now! which of your hips has the most profound sciatica?\n"+
		"MISTRESS OVERDONE\n"+
		"Well, well; there's one yonder arrested and carried\n"+
		"to prison was worth five thousand of you all.\n"+
		"Second Gentleman\n"+
		"Who's that, I pray thee?\n"+
		"MISTRESS OVERDONE\n"+
		"Marry, sir, that's Claudio, Signior Claudio.\n"+
		"First Gentleman\n"+
		"Claudio to prison? 'tis not so.\n"+
		"MISTRESS OVERDONE\n"+
		"Nay, but I know 'tis so: I saw him arrested, saw\n"+
		"him carried away; and, which is more, within these\n"+
		"three days his head to be chopped off.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"But, after all this fooling, I would not have it so.\n"+
		"Art thou sure of this?\n"+
		"MISTRESS OVERDONE\n"+
		"I am too sure of it: and it is for getting Madam\n"+
		"Julietta with child.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"Believe me, this may be: he promised to meet me two\n"+
		"hours since, and he was ever precise in\n"+
		"promise-keeping.\n"+
		"Second Gentleman\n"+
		"Besides, you know, it draws something near to the\n"+
		"speech we had to such a purpose.\n"+
		"First Gentleman\n"+
		"But, most of all, agreeing with the proclamation.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"Away! let's go learn the truth of it.\n"+
		"Exeunt LUCIO and Gentlemen\n"+
		"MISTRESS OVERDONE\n"+
		"Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat, what\n"+
		"with the gallows and what with poverty, I am\n"+
		"custom-shrunk.\n"+
		"Enter POMPEY\n"+
		"How now! what's the news with you?\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"Yonder man is carried to prison.\n"+
		"MISTRESS OVERDONE\n"+
		"Well; what has he done?\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"A woman.\n"+
		"MISTRESS OVERDONE\n"+
		"But what's his offence?\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"Groping for trouts in a peculiar river.\n"+
		"MISTRESS OVERDONE\n"+
		"What, is there a maid with child by him?\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"No, but there's a woman with maid by him. You have\n"+
		"not heard of the proclamation, have you?\n"+
		"MISTRESS OVERDONE\n"+
		"What proclamation, man?\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be plucked down.\n"+
		"MISTRESS OVERDONE\n"+
		"And what shall become of those in the city?\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"They shall stand for seed: they had gone down too,\n"+
		"but that a wise burgher put in for them.\n"+
		"MISTRESS OVERDONE\n"+
		"But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be\n"+
		"pulled down?\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"To the ground, mistress.\n"+
		"MISTRESS OVERDONE\n"+
		"Why, here's a change indeed in the commonwealth!\n"+
		"What shall become of me?\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"Come; fear you not: good counsellors lack no\n"+
		"clients: though you change your place, you need not\n"+
		"change your trade; I'll be your tapster still.\n"+
		"Courage! there will be pity taken on you: you that\n"+
		"have worn your eyes almost out in the service, you\n"+
		"will be considered.\n"+
		"MISTRESS OVERDONE\n"+
		"What's to do here, Thomas tapster? let's withdraw.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"Here comes Signior Claudio, led by the provost to\n"+
		"prison; and there's Madam Juliet.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"Enter Provost, CLAUDIO, JULIET, and Officers\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to the world?\n"+
		"Bear me to prison, where I am committed.\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"I do it not in evil disposition,\n"+
		"But from Lord Angelo by special charge.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Thus can the demigod Authority\n"+
		"Make us pay down for our offence by weight\n"+
		"The words of heaven; on whom it will, it will;\n"+
		"On whom it will not, so; yet still 'tis just.\n"+
		"Re-enter LUCIO and two Gentlemen\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"Why, how now, Claudio! whence comes this restraint?\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty:\n"+
		"As surfeit is the father of much fast,\n"+
		"So every scope by the immoderate use\n"+
		"Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,\n"+
		"Like rats that ravin down their proper bane,\n"+
		"A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"If could speak so wisely under an arrest, I would\n"+
		"send for certain of my creditors: and yet, to say\n"+
		"the truth, I had as lief have the foppery of freedom\n"+
		"as the morality of imprisonment. What's thy\n"+
		"offence, Claudio?\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"What but to speak of would offend again.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"What, is't murder?\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"No.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"Lechery?\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Call it so.\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"Away, sir! you must go.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"One word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"A hundred, if they'll do you any good.\n"+
		"Is lechery so look'd after?\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract\n"+
		"I got possession of Julietta's bed:\n"+
		"You know the lady; she is fast my wife,\n"+
		"Save that we do the denunciation lack\n"+
		"Of outward order: this we came not to,\n"+
		"Only for propagation of a dower\n"+
		"Remaining in the coffer of her friends,\n"+
		"From whom we thought it meet to hide our love\n"+
		"Till time had made them for us. But it chances\n"+
		"The stealth of our most mutual entertainment\n"+
		"With character too gross is writ on Juliet.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"With child, perhaps?\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Unhappily, even so.\n"+
		"And the new deputy now for the duke--\n"+
		"Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,\n"+
		"Or whether that the body public be\n"+
		"A horse whereon the governor doth ride,\n"+
		"Who, newly in the seat, that it may know\n"+
		"He can command, lets it straight feel the spur;\n"+
		"Whether the tyranny be in his place,\n"+
		"Or in his emmence that fills it up,\n"+
		"I stagger in:--but this new governor\n"+
		"Awakes me all the enrolled penalties\n"+
		"Which have, like unscour'd armour, hung by the wall\n"+
		"So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round\n"+
		"And none of them been worn; and, for a name,\n"+
		"Now puts the drowsy and neglected act\n"+
		"Freshly on me: 'tis surely for a name.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"I warrant it is: and thy head stands so tickle on\n"+
		"thy shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love,\n"+
		"may sigh it off. Send after the duke and appeal to\n"+
		"him.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"I have done so, but he's not to be found.\n"+
		"I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:\n"+
		"This day my sister should the cloister enter\n"+
		"And there receive her approbation:\n"+
		"Acquaint her with the danger of my state:\n"+
		"Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends\n"+
		"To the strict deputy; bid herself assay him:\n"+
		"I have great hope in that; for in her youth\n"+
		"There is a prone and speechless dialect,\n"+
		"Such as move men; beside, she hath prosperous art\n"+
		"When she will play with reason and discourse,\n"+
		"And well she can persuade.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"I pray she may; as well for the encouragement of the\n"+
		"like, which else would stand under grievous\n"+
		"imposition, as for the enjoying of thy life, who I\n"+
		"would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a\n"+
		"game of tick-tack. I'll to her.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"I thank you, good friend Lucio.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"Within two hours.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Come, officer, away!\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. A monastery.\n"+
		"Enter DUKE VINCENTIO and FRIAR THOMAS\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"No, holy father; throw away that thought;\n"+
		"Believe not that the dribbling dart of love\n"+
		"Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee\n"+
		"To give me secret harbour, hath a purpose\n"+
		"More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends\n"+
		"Of burning youth.\n"+
		"FRIAR THOMAS\n"+
		"May your grace speak of it?\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"My holy sir, none better knows than you\n"+
		"How I have ever loved the life removed\n"+
		"And held in idle price to haunt assemblies\n"+
		"Where youth, and cost, and witless bravery keeps.\n"+
		"I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo,\n"+
		"A man of stricture and firm abstinence,\n"+
		"My absolute power and place here in Vienna,\n"+
		"And he supposes me travell'd to Poland;\n"+
		"For so I have strew'd it in the common ear,\n"+
		"And so it is received. Now, pious sir,\n"+
		"You will demand of me why I do this?\n"+
		"FRIAR THOMAS\n"+
		"Gladly, my lord.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"We have strict statutes and most biting laws.\n"+
		"The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds,\n"+
		"Which for this nineteen years we have let slip;\n"+
		"Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave,\n"+
		"That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,\n"+
		"Having bound up the threatening twigs of birch,\n"+
		"Only to stick it in their children's sight\n"+
		"For terror, not to use, in time the rod\n"+
		"Becomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees,\n"+
		"Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead;\n"+
		"And liberty plucks justice by the nose;\n"+
		"The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart\n"+
		"Goes all decorum.\n"+
		"FRIAR THOMAS\n"+
		"It rested in your grace\n"+
		"To unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased:\n"+
		"And it in you more dreadful would have seem'd\n"+
		"Than in Lord Angelo.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"I do fear, too dreadful:\n"+
		"Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,\n"+
		"'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them\n"+
		"For what I bid them do: for we bid this be done,\n"+
		"When evil deeds have their permissive pass\n"+
		"And not the punishment. Therefore indeed, my father,\n"+
		"I have on Angelo imposed the office;\n"+
		"Who may, in the ambush of my name, strike home,\n"+
		"And yet my nature never in the fight\n"+
		"To do in slander. And to behold his sway,\n"+
		"I will, as 'twere a brother of your order,\n"+
		"Visit both prince and people: therefore, I prithee,\n"+
		"Supply me with the habit and instruct me\n"+
		"How I may formally in person bear me\n"+
		"Like a true friar. More reasons for this action\n"+
		"At our more leisure shall I render you;\n"+
		"Only, this one: Lord Angelo is precise;\n"+
		"Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses\n"+
		"That his blood flows, or that his appetite\n"+
		"Is more to bread than stone: hence shall we see,\n"+
		"If power change purpose, what our seemers be.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV. A nunnery.\n"+
		"Enter ISABELLA and FRANCISCA\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"And have you nuns no farther privileges?\n"+
		"FRANCISCA\n"+
		"Are not these large enough?\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"Yes, truly; I speak not as desiring more;\n"+
		"But rather wishing a more strict restraint\n"+
		"Upon the sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Clare.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"[Within] Ho! Peace be in this place!\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"Who's that which calls?\n"+
		"FRANCISCA\n"+
		"It is a man's voice. Gentle Isabella,\n"+
		"Turn you the key, and know his business of him;\n"+
		"You may, I may not; you are yet unsworn.\n"+
		"When you have vow'd, you must not speak with men\n"+
		"But in the presence of the prioress:\n"+
		"Then, if you speak, you must not show your face,\n"+
		"Or, if you show your face, you must not speak.\n"+
		"He calls again; I pray you, answer him.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"Peace and prosperity! Who is't that calls\n"+
		"Enter LUCIO\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"Hail, virgin, if you be, as those cheek-roses\n"+
		"Proclaim you are no less! Can you so stead me\n"+
		"As bring me to the sight of Isabella,\n"+
		"A novice of this place and the fair sister\n"+
		"To her unhappy brother Claudio?\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"Why 'her unhappy brother'? let me ask,\n"+
		"The rather for I now must make you know\n"+
		"I am that Isabella and his sister.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"Gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you:\n"+
		"Not to be weary with you, he's in prison.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"Woe me! for what?\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"For that which, if myself might be his judge,\n"+
		"He should receive his punishment in thanks:\n"+
		"He hath got his friend with child.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"Sir, make me not your story.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"It is true.\n"+
		"I would not--though 'tis my familiar sin\n"+
		"With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest,\n"+
		"Tongue far from heart--play with all virgins so:\n"+
		"I hold you as a thing ensky'd and sainted.\n"+
		"By your renouncement an immortal spirit,\n"+
		"And to be talk'd with in sincerity,\n"+
		"As with a saint.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"Do not believe it. Fewness and truth, 'tis thus:\n"+
		"Your brother and his lover have embraced:\n"+
		"As those that feed grow full, as blossoming time\n"+
		"That from the seedness the bare fallow brings\n"+
		"To teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb\n"+
		"Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"Some one with child by him? My cousin Juliet?\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"Is she your cousin?\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"Adoptedly; as school-maids change their names\n"+
		"By vain though apt affection.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"She it is.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"O, let him marry her.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"This is the point.\n"+
		"The duke is very strangely gone from hence;\n"+
		"Bore many gentlemen, myself being one,\n"+
		"In hand and hope of action: but we do learn\n"+
		"By those that know the very nerves of state,\n"+
		"His givings-out were of an infinite distance\n"+
		"From his true-meant design. Upon his place,\n"+
		"And with full line of his authority,\n"+
		"Governs Lord Angelo; a man whose blood\n"+
		"Is very snow-broth; one who never feels\n"+
		"The wanton stings and motions of the sense,\n"+
		"But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge\n"+
		"With profits of the mind, study and fast.\n"+
		"He--to give fear to use and liberty,\n"+
		"Which have for long run by the hideous law,\n"+
		"As mice by lions--hath pick'd out an act,\n"+
		"Under whose heavy sense your brother's life\n"+
		"Falls into forfeit: he arrests him on it;\n"+
		"And follows close the rigour of the statute,\n"+
		"To make him an example. All hope is gone,\n"+
		"Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer\n"+
		"To soften Angelo: and that's my pith of business\n"+
		"'Twixt you and your poor brother.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"Doth he so seek his life?\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"Has censured him\n"+
		"Already; and, as I hear, the provost hath\n"+
		"A warrant for his execution.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"Alas! what poor ability's in me\n"+
		"To do him good?\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"Assay the power you have.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"My power? Alas, I doubt--\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"Our doubts are traitors\n"+
		"And make us lose the good we oft might win\n"+

		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"I'll see what I can do.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"But speedily.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"I will about it straight;\n"+
		"No longer staying but to give the mother\n"+
		"Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you:\n"+
		"Commend me to my brother: soon at night\n"+

		"ACT II\n"+
		"SCENE I. A hall In ANGELO's house.\n"+
		"Enter ANGELO, ESCALUS, and a Justice, Provost, Officers, and other Attendants, behind\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"We must not make a scarecrow of the law,\n"+
		"Setting it up to fear the birds of prey,\n"+
		"And let it keep one shape, till custom make it\n"+
		"Their perch and not their terror.\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"Ay, but yet\n"+
		"Let us be keen, and rather cut a little,\n"+
		"Than fall, and bruise to death. Alas, this gentleman\n"+
		"Whom I would save, had a most noble father!\n"+
		"Let but your honour know,\n"+
		"Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue,\n"+
		"That, in the working of your own affections,\n"+
		"Had time cohered with place or place with wishing,\n"+
		"Or that the resolute acting of your blood\n"+
		"Could have attain'd the effect of your own purpose,\n"+
		"Whether you had not sometime in your life\n"+
		"Err'd in this point which now you censure him,\n"+
		"And pull'd the law upon you.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"'Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,\n"+
		"Another thing to fall. I not deny,\n"+
		"The jury, passing on the prisoner's life,\n"+
		"May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two\n"+
		"Guiltier than him they try. What's open made to justice,\n"+
		"That justice seizes: what know the laws\n"+
		"That thieves do pass on thieves? 'Tis very pregnant,\n"+
		"The jewel that we find, we stoop and take't\n"+
		"Because we see it; but what we do not see\n"+
		"We tread upon, and never think of it.\n"+
		"You may not so extenuate his offence\n"+
		"For I have had such faults; but rather tell me,\n"+
		"When I, that censure him, do so offend,\n"+
		"Let mine own judgment pattern out my death,\n"+
		"And nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die.\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"Be it as your wisdom will.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Where is the provost?\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"Here, if it like your honour.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"See that Claudio\n"+
		"Be executed by nine to-morrow morning:\n"+
		"Bring him his confessor, let him be prepared;\n"+
		"For that's the utmost of his pilgrimage.\n"+
		"Exit Provost\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"[Aside] Well, heaven forgive him! and forgive us all!\n"+
		"Some rise by sin, and some by virtue fall:\n"+
		"Some run from brakes of ice, and answer none:\n"+
		"And some condemned for a fault alone.\n"+
		"Enter ELBOW, and Officers with FROTH and POMPEY\n"+
		"ELBOW\n"+
		"Come, bring them away: if these be good people in\n"+
		"a commonweal that do nothing but use their abuses in\n"+
		"common houses, I know no law: bring them away.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"How now, sir! What's your name? and what's the matter?\n"+
		"ELBOW\n"+
		"If it Please your honour, I am the poor duke's\n"+
		"constable, and my name is Elbow: I do lean upon\n"+
		"justice, sir, and do bring in here before your good\n"+
		"honour two notorious benefactors.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Benefactors? Well; what benefactors are they? are\n"+
		"they not malefactors?\n"+
		"ELBOW\n"+
		"If it? please your honour, I know not well what they\n"+
		"are: but precise villains they are, that I am sure\n"+
		"of; and void of all profanation in the world that\n"+
		"good Christians ought to have.\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"This comes off well; here's a wise officer.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Go to: what quality are they of? Elbow is your\n"+
		"name? why dost thou not speak, Elbow?\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"He cannot, sir; he's out at elbow.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"What are you, sir?\n"+
		"ELBOW\n"+
		"He, sir! a tapster, sir; parcel-bawd; one that\n"+
		"serves a bad woman; whose house, sir, was, as they\n"+
		"say, plucked down in the suburbs; and now she\n"+
		"professes a hot-house, which, I think, is a very ill house too.\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"How know you that?\n"+
		"ELBOW\n"+
		"My wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and your honour,--\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"How? thy wife?\n"+
		"ELBOW\n"+
		"Ay, sir; whom, I thank heaven, is an honest woman,--\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"Dost thou detest her therefore?\n"+
		"ELBOW\n"+
		"I say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well as\n"+
		"she, that this house, if it be not a bawd's house,\n"+
		"it is pity of her life, for it is a naughty house.\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"How dost thou know that, constable?\n"+
		"ELBOW\n"+
		"Marry, sir, by my wife; who, if she had been a woman\n"+
		"cardinally given, might have been accused in\n"+
		"fornication, adultery, and all uncleanliness there.\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"By the woman's means?\n"+
		"ELBOW\n"+
		"Ay, sir, by Mistress Overdone's means: but as she\n"+
		"spit in his face, so she defied him.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"Sir, if it please your honour, this is not so.\n"+
		"ELBOW\n"+
		"Prove it before these varlets here, thou honourable\n"+
		"man; prove it.\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"Do you hear how he misplaces?\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"Sir, she came in great with child; and longing,\n"+
		"saving your honour's reverence, for stewed prunes;\n"+
		"sir, we had but two in the house, which at that very\n"+
		"distant time stood, as it were, in a fruit-dish, a\n"+
		"dish of some three-pence; your honours have seen\n"+
		"such dishes; they are not China dishes, but very\n"+
		"good dishes,--\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"Go to, go to: no matter for the dish, sir.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"No, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are therein in\n"+
		"the right: but to the point. As I say, this\n"+
		"Mistress Elbow, being, as I say, with child, and\n"+
		"being great-bellied, and longing, as I said, for\n"+
		"prunes; and having but two in the dish, as I said,\n"+
		"Master Froth here, this very man, having eaten the\n"+
		"rest, as I said, and, as I say, paying for them very\n"+
		"honestly; for, as you know, Master Froth, I could\n"+
		"not give you three-pence again.\n"+
		"FROTH\n"+
		"No, indeed.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"Very well: you being then, if you be remembered,\n"+
		"cracking the stones of the foresaid prunes,--\n"+
		"FROTH\n"+
		"Ay, so I did indeed.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"Why, very well; I telling you then, if you be\n"+
		"remembered, that such a one and such a one were past\n"+
		"cure of the thing you wot of, unless they kept very\n"+
		"good diet, as I told you,--\n"+
		"FROTH\n"+
		"All this is true.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"Why, very well, then,--\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"Come, you are a tedious fool: to the purpose. What\n"+
		"was done to Elbow's wife, that he hath cause to\n"+
		"complain of? Come me to what was done to her.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"Sir, your honour cannot come to that yet.\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"No, sir, nor I mean it not.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"Sir, but you shall come to it, by your honour's\n"+
		"leave. And, I beseech you, look into Master Froth\n"+
		"here, sir; a man of four-score pound a year; whose\n"+
		"father died at Hallowmas: was't not at Hallowmas,\n"+
		"Master Froth?\n"+
		"FROTH\n"+
		"All-hallond eve.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"Why, very well; I hope here be truths. He, sir,\n"+
		"sitting, as I say, in a lower chair, sir; 'twas in\n"+
		"the Bunch of Grapes, where indeed you have a delight\n"+
		"to sit, have you not?\n"+
		"FROTH\n"+
		"I have so; because it is an open room and good for winter.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"Why, very well, then; I hope here be truths.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"This will last out a night in Russia,\n"+
		"When nights are longest there: I'll take my leave.\n"+
		"And leave you to the hearing of the cause;\n"+
		"Hoping you'll find good cause to whip them all.\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"I think no less. Good morrow to your lordship.\n"+
		"Exit ANGELO\n"+
		"Now, sir, come on: what was done to Elbow's wife, once more?\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"Once, sir? there was nothing done to her once.\n"+
		"ELBOW\n"+
		"I beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"I beseech your honour, ask me.\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"Well, sir; what did this gentleman to her?\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"I beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman's face.\n"+
		"Good Master Froth, look upon his honour; 'tis for a\n"+
		"good purpose. Doth your honour mark his face?\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"Ay, sir, very well.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"Nay; I beseech you, mark it well.\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"Well, I do so.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"Doth your honour see any harm in his face?\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"Why, no.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"I'll be supposed upon a book, his face is the worst\n"+
		"thing about him. Good, then; if his face be the\n"+
		"worst thing about him, how could Master Froth do the\n"+
		"constable's wife any harm? I would know that of\n"+
		"your honour.\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"He's in the right. Constable, what say you to it?\n"+
		"ELBOW\n"+
		"First, an it like you, the house is a respected\n"+
		"house; next, this is a respected fellow; and his\n"+
		"mistress is a respected woman.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected\n"+
		"person than any of us all.\n"+
		"ELBOW\n"+
		"Varlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicked varlet! the\n"+
		"time has yet to come that she was ever respected\n"+
		"with man, woman, or child.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"Sir, she was respected with him before he married with her.\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"Which is the wiser here? Justice or Iniquity? Is\n"+
		"this true?\n"+
		"ELBOW\n"+
		"O thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O thou wicked\n"+
		"Hannibal! I respected with her before I was married\n"+
		"to her! If ever I was respected with her, or she\n"+
		"with me, let not your worship think me the poor\n"+
		"duke's officer. Prove this, thou wicked Hannibal, or\n"+
		"I'll have mine action of battery on thee.\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"If he took you a box o' the ear, you might have your\n"+
		"action of slander too.\n"+
		"ELBOW\n"+
		"Marry, I thank your good worship for it. What is't\n"+
		"your worship's pleasure I shall do with this wicked caitiff?\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"Truly, officer, because he hath some offences in him\n"+
		"that thou wouldst discover if thou couldst, let him\n"+
		"continue in his courses till thou knowest what they\n"+
		"are.\n"+
		"ELBOW\n"+
		"Marry, I thank your worship for it. Thou seest, thou\n"+
		"wicked varlet, now, what's come upon thee: thou art\n"+
		"to continue now, thou varlet; thou art to continue.\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"Where were you born, friend?\n"+
		"FROTH\n"+
		"Here in Vienna, sir.\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"Are you of fourscore pounds a year?\n"+
		"FROTH\n"+
		"Yes, an't please you, sir.\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"So. What trade are you of, sir?\n"+
		"POMPHEY\n"+
		"Tapster; a poor widow's tapster.\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"Your mistress' name?\n"+
		"POMPHEY\n"+
		"Mistress Overdone.\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"Hath she had any more than one husband?\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"Nine, sir; Overdone by the last.\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"Nine! Come hither to me, Master Froth. Master\n"+
		"Froth, I would not have you acquainted with\n"+
		"tapsters: they will draw you, Master Froth, and you\n"+
		"will hang them. Get you gone, and let me hear no\n"+
		"more of you.\n"+
		"FROTH\n"+
		"I thank your worship. For mine own part, I never\n"+
		"come into any room in a tap-house, but I am drawn\n"+
		"in.\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"Well, no more of it, Master Froth: farewell.\n"+
		"Exit FROTH\n"+
		"Come you hither to me, Master tapster. What's your\n"+
		"name, Master tapster?\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"Pompey.\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"What else?\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"Bum, sir.\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you;\n"+
		"so that in the beastliest sense you are Pompey the\n"+
		"Great. Pompey, you are partly a bawd, Pompey,\n"+
		"howsoever you colour it in being a tapster, are you\n"+
		"not? come, tell me true: it shall be the better for you.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live.\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"How would you live, Pompey? by being a bawd? What\n"+
		"do you think of the trade, Pompey? is it a lawful trade?\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"If the law would allow it, sir.\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"But the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shall\n"+
		"not be allowed in Vienna.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"Does your worship mean to geld and splay all the\n"+
		"youth of the city?\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"No, Pompey.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"Truly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to't then.\n"+
		"If your worship will take order for the drabs and\n"+
		"the knaves, you need not to fear the bawds.\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"There are pretty orders beginning, I can tell you:\n"+
		"it is but heading and hanging.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"If you head and hang all that offend that way but\n"+
		"for ten year together, you'll be glad to give out a\n"+
		"commission for more heads: if this law hold in\n"+
		"Vienna ten year, I'll rent the fairest house in it\n"+
		"after three-pence a bay: if you live to see this\n"+
		"come to pass, say Pompey told you so.\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"Thank you, good Pompey; and, in requital of your\n"+
		"prophecy, hark you: I advise you, let me not find\n"+
		"you before me again upon any complaint whatsoever;\n"+
		"no, not for dwelling where you do: if I do, Pompey,\n"+
		"I shall beat you to your tent, and prove a shrewd\n"+
		"Caesar to you; in plain dealing, Pompey, I shall\n"+
		"have you whipt: so, for this time, Pompey, fare you well.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"I thank your worship for your good counsel:\n"+
		"Aside\n"+
		"but I shall follow it as the flesh and fortune shall\n"+
		"better determine.\n"+
		"Whip me? No, no; let carman whip his jade:\n"+
		"The valiant heart is not whipt out of his trade.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"Come hither to me, Master Elbow; come hither, Master\n"+
		"constable. How long have you been in this place of constable?\n"+
		"ELBOW\n"+
		"Seven year and a half, sir.\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"I thought, by your readiness in the office, you had\n"+
		"continued in it some time. You say, seven years together?\n"+
		"ELBOW\n"+
		"And a half, sir.\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"Alas, it hath been great pains to you. They do you\n"+
		"wrong to put you so oft upon 't: are there not men\n"+
		"in your ward sufficient to serve it?\n"+
		"ELBOW\n"+
		"Faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters: as they\n"+
		"are chosen, they are glad to choose me for them; I\n"+
		"do it for some piece of money, and go through with\n"+
		"all.\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"Look you bring me in the names of some six or seven,\n"+
		"the most sufficient of your parish.\n"+
		"ELBOW\n"+
		"To your worship's house, sir?\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"To my house. Fare you well.\n"+
		"Exit ELBOW\n"+
		"What's o'clock, think you?\n"+
		"Justice\n"+
		"Eleven, sir.\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"I pray you home to dinner with me.\n"+
		"Justice\n"+
		"I humbly thank you.\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"It grieves me for the death of Claudio;\n"+
		"But there's no remedy.\n"+
		"Justice\n"+
		"Lord Angelo is severe.\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"It is but needful:\n"+
		"Mercy is not itself, that oft looks so;\n"+
		"Pardon is still the nurse of second woe:\n"+
		"But yet,--poor Claudio! There is no remedy.\n"+
		"Come, sir.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. Another room in the same.\n"+
		"Enter Provost and a Servant\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"He's hearing of a cause; he will come straight\n"+
		"I'll tell him of you.\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"Pray you, do.\n"+
		"Exit Servant\n"+
		"I'll know\n"+
		"His pleasure; may be he will relent. Alas,\n"+
		"He hath but as offended in a dream!\n"+
		"All sects, all ages smack of this vice; and he\n"+
		"To die for't!\n"+
		"Enter ANGELO\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Now, what's the matter. Provost?\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"Is it your will Claudio shall die tomorrow?\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Did not I tell thee yea? hadst thou not order?\n"+
		"Why dost thou ask again?\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"Lest I might be too rash:\n"+
		"Under your good correction, I have seen,\n"+
		"When, after execution, judgment hath\n"+
		"Repented o'er his doom.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Go to; let that be mine:\n"+
		"Do you your office, or give up your place,\n"+
		"And you shall well be spared.\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"I crave your honour's pardon.\n"+
		"What shall be done, sir, with the groaning Juliet?\n"+
		"She's very near her hour.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Dispose of her\n"+
		"To some more fitter place, and that with speed.\n"+
		"Re-enter Servant\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"Here is the sister of the man condemn'd\n"+
		"Desires access to you.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Hath he a sister?\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"Ay, my good lord; a very virtuous maid,\n"+
		"And to be shortly of a sisterhood,\n"+
		"If not already.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Well, let her be admitted.\n"+
		"Exit Servant\n"+
		"See you the fornicatress be removed:\n"+
		"Let have needful, but not lavish, means;\n"+
		"There shall be order for't.\n"+
		"Enter ISABELLA and LUCIO\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"God save your honour!\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Stay a little while.\n"+
		"To ISABELLA\n"+
		"You're welcome: what's your will?\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"I am a woeful suitor to your honour,\n"+
		"Please but your honour hear me.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Well; what's your suit?\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"There is a vice that most I do abhor,\n"+
		"And most desire should meet the blow of justice;\n"+
		"For which I would not plead, but that I must;\n"+
		"For which I must not plead, but that I am\n"+
		"At war 'twixt will and will not.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Well; the matter?\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"I have a brother is condemn'd to die:\n"+
		"I do beseech you, let it be his fault,\n"+
		"And not my brother.\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"[Aside] Heaven give thee moving graces!\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Condemn the fault and not the actor of it?\n"+
		"Why, every fault's condemn'd ere it be done:\n"+
		"Mine were the very cipher of a function,\n"+
		"To fine the faults whose fine stands in record,\n"+
		"And let go by the actor.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"O just but severe law!\n"+
		"I had a brother, then. Heaven keep your honour!\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"[Aside to ISABELLA] Give't not o'er so: to him\n"+
		"again, entreat him;\n"+
		"Kneel down before him, hang upon his gown:\n"+
		"You are too cold; if you should need a pin,\n"+
		"You could not with more tame a tongue desire it:\n"+
		"To him, I say!\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"Must he needs die?\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Maiden, no remedy.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"Yes; I do think that you might pardon him,\n"+
		"And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"I will not do't.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"But can you, if you would?\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Look, what I will not, that I cannot do.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"But might you do't, and do the world no wrong,\n"+
		"If so your heart were touch'd with that remorse\n"+
		"A s mine is to him?\n"+

		"He's sentenced; 'tis too late.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"[Aside to ISABELLA] You are too cold.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"Too late? why, no; I, that do speak a word.\n"+
		"May call it back again. Well, believe this,\n"+
		"No ceremony that to great ones 'longs,\n"+
		"Not the king's crown, nor the deputed sword,\n"+
		"The marshal's truncheon, nor the judge's robe,\n"+
		"Become them with one half so good a grace\n"+
		"As mercy does.\n"+
		"If he had been as you and you as he,\n"+
		"You would have slipt like him; but he, like you,\n"+
		"Would not have been so stern.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Pray you, be gone.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"I would to heaven I had your potency,\n"+
		"And you were Isabel! should it then be thus?\n"+
		"No; I would tell what 'twere to be a judge,\n"+
		"And what a prisoner.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"[Aside to ISABELLA]\n"+
		"Ay, touch him; there's the vein.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Your brother is a forfeit of the law,\n"+
		"And you but waste your words.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"Alas, alas!\n"+
		"Why, all the souls that were were forfeit once;\n"+
		"And He that might the vantage best have took\n"+
		"Found out the remedy. How would you be,\n"+
		"If He, which is the top of judgment, should\n"+
		"But judge you as you are? O, think on that;\n"+
		"And mercy then will breathe within your lips,\n"+
		"Like man new made.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Be you content, fair maid;\n"+

		"Were he my kinsman, brother, or my son,\n"+
		"It should be thus with him: he must die tomorrow.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"To-morrow! O, that's sudden! Spare him, spare him!\n"+
		"He's not prepared for death. Even for our kitchens\n"+
		"We kill the fowl of season: shall we serve heaven\n"+
		"With less respect than we do minister\n"+
		"To our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you;\n"+
		"Who is it that hath died for this offence?\n"+
		"There's many have committed it.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"[Aside to ISABELLA] Ay, well said.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept:\n"+
		"Those many had not dared to do that evil,\n"+
		"If the first that did the edict infringe\n"+
		"Had answer'd for his deed: now 'tis awake\n"+
		"Takes note of what is done; and, like a prophet,\n"+
		"Looks in a glass, that shows what future evils,\n"+
		"Either new, or by remissness new-conceived,\n"+
		"And so in progress to be hatch'd and born,\n"+
		"Are now to have no successive degrees,\n"+
		"But, ere they live, to end.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"Yet show some pity.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"I show it most of all when I show justice;\n"+
		"For then I pity those I do not know,\n"+
		"Which a dismiss'd offence would after gall;\n"+
		"And do him right that, answering one foul wrong,\n"+
		"Lives not to act another. Be satisfied;\n"+
		"Your brother dies to-morrow; be content.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"So you must be the first that gives this sentence,\n"+
		"And he, that suffer's. O, it is excellent\n"+
		"To have a giant's strength; but it is tyrannous\n"+
		"To use it like a giant.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"[Aside to ISABELLA] That's well said.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"Could great men thunder\n"+
		"As Jove himself does, Jove would ne'er be quiet,\n"+
		"For every pelting, petty officer\n"+
		"Would use his heaven for thunder;\n"+
		"Nothing but thunder! Merciful Heaven,\n"+
		"Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt\n"+
		"Split'st the unwedgeable and gnarled oak\n"+
		"Than the soft myrtle: but man, proud man,\n"+
		"Drest in a little brief authority,\n"+
		"Most ignorant of what he's most assured,\n"+
		"His glassy essence, like an angry ape,\n"+
		"Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven\n"+

		"Would all themselves laugh mortal.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"[Aside to ISABELLA] O, to him, to him, wench! he\n"+
		"will relent;\n"+

		"But in the less foul profanation.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"Thou'rt i' the right, girl; more o, that.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"That in the captain's but a choleric word,\n"+
		"Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy.\n"+

		"[Aside to ISABELLA] Art avised o' that? more on 't.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Why do you put these sayings upon me?\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"Because authority, though it err like others,\n"+
		"Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself,\n"+
		"That skins the vice o' the top. Go to your bosom;\n"+
		"Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know\n"+
		"That's like my brother's fault: if it confess\n"+

		"Or stones whose rates are either rich or poor\n"+
		"As fancy values them; but with true prayers\n"+
		"That shall be up at heaven and enter there\n"+
		"Ere sun-rise, prayers from preserved souls,\n"+

		"That, lying by the violet in the sun,\n"+
		"Do as the carrion does, not as the flower,\n"+
		"Corrupt with virtuous season. Can it be\n"+
		"That modesty may more betray our sense\n"+
		"Than woman's lightness? Having waste ground enough,\n"+
		"Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary\n"+
		"And pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie!\n"+
		"What dost thou, or what art thou, Angelo?\n"+
		"Dost thou desire her foully for those things\n"+
		"That make her good? O, let her brother live!\n"+
		"Thieves for their robbery have authority\n"+
		"When judges steal themselves. What, do I love her,\n"+
		"That I desire to hear her speak again,\n"+
		"And feast upon her eyes? What is't I dream on?\n"+
		"O cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint,\n"+
		"With saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous\n"+
		"Is that temptation that doth goad us on\n"+
		"To sin in loving virtue: never could the strumpet,\n"+
		"With all her double vigour, art and nature,\n"+
		"Once stir my temper; but this virtuous maid\n"+

		"SCENE III. A room in a prison.\n"+
		"Enter, severally, DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as a friar, and Provost\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Hail to you, provost! so I think you are.\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"I am the provost. What's your will, good friar?\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Bound by my charity and my blest order,\n"+
		"I come to visit the afflicted spirits\n"+
		"Here in the prison. Do me the common right\n"+
		"To let me see them and to make me know\n"+
		"The nature of their crimes, that I may minister\n"+
		"To them accordingly.\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"I would do more than that, if more were needful.\n"+
		"Enter JULIET\n"+
		"Look, here comes one: a gentlewoman of mine,\n"+
		"Who, falling in the flaws of her own youth,\n"+
		"Hath blister'd her report: she is with child;\n"+
		"And he that got it, sentenced; a young man\n"+
		"More fit to do another such offence\n"+
		"Than die for this.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"When must he die?\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"As I do think, to-morrow.\n"+
		"I have provided for you: stay awhile,\n"+

		"And you shall be conducted.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?\n"+
		"JULIET\n"+
		"I do; and bear the shame most patiently.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"I'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience,\n"+
		"And try your penitence, if it be sound,\n"+
		"Or hollowly put on.\n"+
		"JULIET\n"+
		"I'll gladly learn.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Love you the man that wrong'd you?\n"+
		"JULIET\n"+
		"Yes, as I love the woman that wrong'd him.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"So then it seems your most offenceful act\n"+
		"Was mutually committed?\n"+
		"JULIET\n"+
		"Mutually.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Then was your sin of heavier kind than his.\n"+
		"JULIET\n"+
		"I do confess it, and repent it, father.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"'Tis meet so, daughter: but lest you do repent,\n"+
		"As that the sin hath brought you to this shame,\n"+

		"But as we stand in fear,--\n"+
		"JULIET\n"+

		"SCENE IV. A room in ANGELO's house.\n"+
		"Enter ANGELO\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"When I would pray and think, I think and pray\n"+
		"To several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words;\n"+
		"Whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue,\n"+
		"Anchors on Isabel: Heaven in my mouth,\n"+
		"As if I did but only chew his name;\n"+
		"And in my heart the strong and swelling evil\n"+
		"Of my conception. The state, whereon I studied\n"+
		"Is like a good thing, being often read,\n"+
		"Grown fear'd and tedious; yea, my gravity,\n"+
		"Wherein--let no man hear me--I take pride,\n"+
		"Could I with boot change for an idle plume,\n"+
		"Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form,\n"+
		"How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,\n"+
		"Wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls\n"+
		"To thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood:\n"+
		"Let's write good angel on the devil's horn:\n"+
		"'Tis not the devil's crest.\n"+
		"Enter a Servant\n"+
		"How now! who's there?\n"+
		"Servant\n"+
		"One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Teach her the way.\n"+
		"Exit Servant\n"+
		"O heavens!\n"+
		"Why does my blood thus muster to my heart,\n"+
		"Making both it unable for itself,\n"+
		"And dispossessing all my other parts\n"+
		"Of necessary fitness?\n"+
		"So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons;\n"+
		"Come all to help him, and so stop the air\n"+
		"By which he should revive: and even so\n"+
		"The general, subject to a well-wish'd king,\n"+
		"Quit their own part, and in obsequious fondness\n"+
		"Crowd to his presence, where their untaught love\n"+
		"Must needs appear offence.\n"+
		"Enter ISABELLA\n"+
		"How now, fair maid?\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"I am come to know your pleasure.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"That you might know it, would much better please me\n"+
		"Than to demand what 'tis. Your brother cannot live.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"Even so. Heaven keep your honour!\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Yet may he live awhile; and, it may be,\n"+
		"As long as you or I\n"+
		"yet he must die.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"Under your sentence?\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Yea.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"When, I beseech you? that in his reprieve,\n"+
		"Longer or shorter, he may be so fitted\n"+
		"That his soul sicken not.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Ha! fie, these filthy vices! It were as good\n"+
		"To pardon him that hath from nature stolen\n"+
		"A man already made, as to remit\n"+
		"Their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's image\n"+
		"In stamps that are forbid: 'tis all as easy\n"+
		"Falsely to take away a life true made\n"+
		"As to put metal in restrained means\n"+
		"To make a false one.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Say you so? then I shall pose you quickly.\n"+
		"Which had you rather, that the most just law\n"+
		"Now took your brother's life; or, to redeem him,\n"+
		"Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness\n"+
		"As she that he hath stain'd?\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"Sir, believe this,\n"+
		"I had rather give my body than my soul.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"I talk not of your soul: our compell'd sins\n"+
		"Stand more for number than for accompt.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"How say you?\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Nay, I'll not warrant that; for I can speak\n"+
		"Against the thing I say. Answer to this:\n"+
		"I, now the voice of the recorded law,\n"+
		"Pronounce a sentence on your brother's life:\n"+
		"Might there not be a charity in sin\n"+
		"To save this brother's life?\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"Please you to do't,\n"+
		"I'll take it as a peril to my soul,\n"+
		"It is no sin at all, but charity.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Pleased you to do't at peril of your soul,\n"+
		"Were equal poise of sin and charity.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"That I do beg his life, if it be sin,\n"+
		"Heaven let me bear it! you granting of my suit,\n"+
		"If that be sin, I'll make it my morn prayer\n"+
		"To have it added to the faults of mine,\n"+
		"And nothing of your answer.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Nay, but hear me.\n"+
		"Your sense pursues not mine: either you are ignorant,\n"+
		"Or seem so craftily; and that's not good.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good,\n"+
		"But graciously to know I am no better.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright\n"+
		"When it doth tax itself; as these black masks\n"+
		"Proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder\n"+
		"Than beauty could, display'd. But mark me;\n"+
		"To be received plain, I'll speak more gross:\n"+
		"Your brother is to die.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"So.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"And his offence is so, as it appears,\n"+
		"Accountant to the law upon that pain.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"True.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Admit no other way to save his life,--\n"+
		"As I subscribe not that, nor any other,\n"+
		"But in the loss of question,--that you, his sister,\n"+
		"Finding yourself desired of such a person,\n"+
		"Whose credit with the judge, or own great place,\n"+
		"Could fetch your brother from the manacles\n"+
		"Of the all-building law; and that there were\n"+
		"No earthly mean to save him, but that either\n"+
		"You must lay down the treasures of your body\n"+
		"To this supposed, or else to let him suffer;\n"+
		"What would you do?\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"As much for my poor brother as myself:\n"+
		"That is, were I under the terms of death,\n"+
		"The impression of keen whips I'ld wear as rubies,\n"+
		"And strip myself to death, as to a bed\n"+
		"That longing have been sick for, ere I'ld yield\n"+
		"My body up to shame.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Then must your brother die.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"And 'twere the cheaper way:\n"+
		"Better it were a brother died at once,\n"+
		"Than that a sister, by redeeming him,\n"+
		"Should die for ever.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Were not you then as cruel as the sentence\n"+
		"That you have slander'd so?\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"Ignomy in ransom and free pardon\n"+
		"Are of two houses: lawful mercy\n"+
		"Is nothing kin to foul redemption.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;\n"+
		"And rather proved the sliding of your brother\n"+
		"A merriment than a vice.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"O, pardon me, my lord; it oft falls out,\n"+
		"To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean:\n"+
		"I something do excuse the thing I hate,\n"+
		"For his advantage that I dearly love.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"We are all frail.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"Else let my brother die,\n"+
		"If not a feodary, but only he\n"+
		"Owe and succeed thy weakness.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Nay, women are frail too.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves;\n"+
		"Which are as easy broke as they make forms.\n"+
		"Women! Help Heaven! men their creation mar\n"+
		"In profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail;\n"+
		"For we are soft as our complexions are,\n"+
		"And credulous to false prints.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"I think it well:\n"+
		"And from this testimony of your own sex,--\n"+
		"Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger\n"+
		"Than faults may shake our frames,--let me be bold;\n"+
		"I do arrest your words. Be that you are,\n"+
		"That is, a woman; if you be more, you're none;\n"+
		"If you be one, as you are well express'd\n"+
		"By all external warrants, show it now,\n"+
		"By putting on the destined livery.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"I have no tongue but one: gentle my lord,\n"+
		"Let me entreat you speak the former language.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Plainly conceive, I love you.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"My brother did love Juliet,\n"+
		"And you tell me that he shall die for it.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"I know your virtue hath a licence in't,\n"+
		"Which seems a little fouler than it is,\n"+
		"To pluck on others.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Believe me, on mine honour,\n"+
		"My words express my purpose.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"Ha! little honour to be much believed,\n"+
		"And most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming!\n"+
		"I will proclaim thee, Angelo; look for't:\n"+
		"Sign me a present pardon for my brother,\n"+
		"Or with an outstretch'd throat I'll tell the world aloud\n"+
		"What man thou art.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Who will believe thee, Isabel?\n"+
		"My unsoil'd name, the austereness of my life,\n"+
		"My vouch against you, and my place i' the state,\n"+
		"Will so your accusation overweigh,\n"+
		"That you shall stifle in your own report\n"+
		"And smell of calumny. I have begun,\n"+
		"And now I give my sensual race the rein:\n"+
		"Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite;\n"+
		"Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes,\n"+
		"That banish what they sue for; redeem thy brother\n"+
		"By yielding up thy body to my will;\n"+
		"Or else he must not only die the death,\n"+
		"But thy unkindness shall his death draw out\n"+
		"To lingering sufferance. Answer me to-morrow,\n"+
		"Or, by the affection that now guides me most,\n"+
		"I'll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,\n"+
		"Say what you can, my false o'erweighs your true.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,\n"+
		"Who would believe me? O perilous mouths,\n"+
		"That bear in them one and the self-same tongue,\n"+
		"Either of condemnation or approof;\n"+
		"Bidding the law make court'sy to their will:\n"+
		"Hooking both right and wrong to the appetite,\n"+
		"To follow as it draws! I'll to my brother:\n"+
		"Though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood,\n"+
		"Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour.\n"+
		"That, had he twenty heads to tender down\n"+
		"On twenty bloody blocks, he'ld yield them up,\n"+
		"Before his sister should her body stoop\n"+
		"To such abhorr'd pollution.\n"+
		"Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die:\n"+
		"More than our brother is our chastity.\n"+
		"I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,\n"+
		"And fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"ACT III\n"+
		"SCENE I. A room in the prison.\n"+
		"Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before, CLAUDIO, and Provost\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"The miserable have no other medicine\n"+
		"But only hope:\n"+
		"I've hope to live, and am prepared to die.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Be absolute for death; either death or life\n"+
		"Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life:\n"+
		"If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing\n"+
		"That none but fools would keep: a breath thou art,\n"+
		"Servile to all the skyey influences,\n"+
		"That dost this habitation, where thou keep'st,\n"+
		"Hourly afflict: merely, thou art death's fool;\n"+
		"For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun\n"+
		"And yet runn'st toward him still. Thou art not noble;\n"+
		"For all the accommodations that thou bear'st\n"+
		"Are nursed by baseness. Thou'rt by no means valiant;\n"+
		"For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork\n"+
		"Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,\n"+
		"And that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear'st\n"+
		"Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;\n"+
		"For thou exist'st on many a thousand grains\n"+
		"That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;\n"+
		"For what thou hast not, still thou strivest to get,\n"+
		"And what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain;\n"+
		"For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,\n"+
		"After the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor;\n"+
		"For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,\n"+
		"Thou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey,\n"+
		"And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;\n"+
		"For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,\n"+
		"The mere effusion of thy proper loins,\n"+
		"Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,\n"+
		"For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,\n"+
		"But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,\n"+
		"Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth\n"+
		"Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms\n"+
		"Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,\n"+
		"Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,\n"+
		"To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this\n"+
		"That bears the name of life? Yet in this life\n"+
		"Lie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear,\n"+
		"That makes these odds all even.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"I humbly thank you.\n"+
		"To sue to live, I find I seek to die;\n"+
		"And, seeking death, find life: let it come on.\n"+

		"To-morrow you set on.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Is there no remedy?\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"None, but such remedy as, to save a head,\n"+
		"To cleave a heart in twain.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"But is there any?\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"Yes, brother, you may live:\n"+
		"There is a devilish mercy in the judge,\n"+
		"If you'll implore it, that will free your life,\n"+
		"But fetter you till death.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Perpetual durance?\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,\n"+
		"Though all the world's vastidity you had,\n"+
		"To a determined scope.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"But in what nature?\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"In such a one as, you consenting to't,\n"+
		"Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear,\n"+
		"And leave you naked.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Let me know the point.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"O, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,\n"+
		"Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,\n"+
		"And six or seven winters more respect\n"+
		"Than a perpetual honour. Darest thou die?\n"+
		"The sense of death is most in apprehension;\n"+
		"And the poor beetle, that we tread upon,\n"+
		"In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great\n"+
		"As when a giant dies.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Why give you me this shame?\n"+
		"Think you I can a resolution fetch\n"+
		"From flowery tenderness? If I must die,\n"+
		"I will encounter darkness as a bride,\n"+
		"And hug it in mine arms.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"There spake my brother; there my father's grave\n"+
		"Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:\n"+
		"Thou art too noble to conserve a life\n"+
		"In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,\n"+
		"Whose settled visage and deliberate word\n"+
		"Nips youth i' the head and follies doth emmew\n"+
		"As falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil\n"+
		"His filth within being cast, he would appear\n"+
		"A pond as deep as hell.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"The prenzie Angelo!\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell,\n"+
		"The damned'st body to invest and cover\n"+
		"In prenzie guards! Dost thou think, Claudio?\n"+
		"If I would yield him my virginity,\n"+
		"Thou mightst be freed.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"O heavens! it cannot be.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"Yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,\n"+
		"So to offend him still. This night's the time\n"+
		"That I should do what I abhor to name,\n"+
		"Or else thou diest to-morrow.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Thou shalt not do't.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"O, were it but my life,\n"+
		"I'ld throw it down for your deliverance\n"+
		"As frankly as a pin.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Thanks, dear Isabel.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"Be ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Yes. Has he affections in him,\n"+
		"That thus can make him bite the law by the nose,\n"+
		"When he would force it? Sure, it is no sin,\n"+
		"Or of the deadly seven, it is the least.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"Which is the least?\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"If it were damnable, he being so wise,\n"+
		"Why would he for the momentary trick\n"+
		"Be perdurably fined? O Isabel!\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"What says my brother?\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Death is a fearful thing.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"And shamed life a hateful.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;\n"+
		"To lie in cold obstruction and to rot;\n"+
		"This sensible warm motion to become\n"+
		"A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit\n"+
		"To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside\n"+
		"In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;\n"+
		"To be imprison'd in the viewless winds,\n"+
		"And blown with restless violence round about\n"+
		"The pendent world; or to be worse than worst\n"+
		"Of those that lawless and incertain thought\n"+
		"Imagine howling: 'tis too horrible!\n"+
		"The weariest and most loathed worldly life\n"+
		"That age, ache, penury and imprisonment\n"+
		"Can lay on nature is a paradise\n"+
		"To what we fear of death.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"Alas, alas!\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Sweet sister, let me live:\n"+
		"What sin you do to save a brother's life,\n"+
		"Nature dispenses with the deed so far\n"+
		"That it becomes a virtue.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"O you beast!\n"+
		"O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!\n"+
		"Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?\n"+
		"Is't not a kind of incest, to take life\n"+
		"From thine own sister's shame? What should I think?\n"+
		"Heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair!\n"+
		"For such a warped slip of wilderness\n"+
		"Ne'er issued from his blood. Take my defiance!\n"+
		"Die, perish! Might but my bending down\n"+
		"Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:\n"+
		"I'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,\n"+
		"No word to save thee.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Nay, hear me, Isabel.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"O, fie, fie, fie!\n"+
		"Thy sin's not accidental, but a trade.\n"+
		"Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd:\n"+
		"'Tis best thou diest quickly.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"O hear me, Isabella!\n"+
		"Re-enter DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Vouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"What is your will?\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Might you dispense with your leisure, I would by and\n"+
		"by have some speech with you: the satisfaction I\n"+
		"would require is likewise your own benefit.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"I have no superfluous leisure; my stay must be\n"+
		"stolen out of other affairs; but I will attend you awhile.\n"+
		"Walks apart\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Son, I have overheard what hath passed between you\n"+
		"and your sister. Angelo had never the purpose to\n"+
		"corrupt her; only he hath made an essay of her\n"+
		"virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition\n"+
		"of natures: she, having the truth of honour in her,\n"+
		"hath made him that gracious denial which he is most\n"+
		"glad to receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I\n"+
		"know this to be true; therefore prepare yourself to\n"+
		"death: do not satisfy your resolution with hopes\n"+
		"that are fallible: tomorrow you must die; go to\n"+
		"your knees and make ready.\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love\n"+
		"with life that I will sue to be rid of it.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Hold you there: farewell.\n"+
		"Exit CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Provost, a word with you!\n"+
		"Re-enter Provost\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"What's your will, father\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"That now you are come, you will be gone. Leave me\n"+
		"awhile with the maid: my mind promises with my\n"+
		"habit no loss shall touch her by my company.\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"In good time.\n"+
		"Exit Provost. ISABELLA comes forward\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good:\n"+
		"the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty\n"+
		"brief in goodness; but grace, being the soul of\n"+
		"your complexion, shall keep the body of it ever\n"+
		"fair. The assault that Angelo hath made to you,\n"+
		"fortune hath conveyed to my understanding; and, but\n"+
		"that frailty hath examples for his falling, I should\n"+
		"wonder at Angelo. How will you do to content this\n"+
		"substitute, and to save your brother?\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"I am now going to resolve him: I had rather my\n"+
		"brother die by the law than my son should be\n"+
		"unlawfully born. But, O, how much is the good duke\n"+
		"deceived in Angelo! If ever he return and I can\n"+
		"speak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or\n"+
		"discover his government.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"That shall not be much amiss: Yet, as the matter\n"+
		"now stands, he will avoid your accusation; he made\n"+
		"trial of you only. Therefore fasten your ear on my\n"+
		"advisings: to the love I have in doing good a\n"+
		"remedy presents itself. I do make myself believe\n"+
		"that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged\n"+
		"lady a merited benefit; redeem your brother from\n"+
		"the angry law; do no stain to your own gracious\n"+
		"person; and much please the absent duke, if\n"+
		"peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of\n"+
		"this business.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"Let me hear you speak farther. I have spirit to do\n"+
		"anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have\n"+
		"you not heard speak of Mariana, the sister of\n"+
		"Frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea?\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"She should this Angelo have married; was affianced\n"+
		"to her by oath, and the nuptial appointed: between\n"+
		"which time of the contract and limit of the\n"+
		"solemnity, her brother Frederick was wrecked at sea,\n"+
		"having in that perished vessel the dowry of his\n"+
		"sister. But mark how heavily this befell to the\n"+
		"poor gentlewoman: there she lost a noble and\n"+
		"renowned brother, in his love toward her ever most\n"+
		"kind and natural; with him, the portion and sinew of\n"+
		"her fortune, her marriage-dowry; with both, her\n"+
		"combinate husband, this well-seeming Angelo.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"Can this be so? did Angelo so leave her?\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them\n"+
		"with his comfort; swallowed his vows whole,\n"+
		"pretending in her discoveries of dishonour: in few,\n"+
		"bestowed her on her own lamentation, which she yet\n"+
		"wears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears,\n"+
		"is washed with them, but relents not.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid\n"+
		"from the world! What corruption in this life, that\n"+
		"it will let this man live! But how out of this can she avail?\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"It is a rupture that you may easily heal: and the\n"+
		"cure of it not only saves your brother, but keeps\n"+
		"you from dishonour in doing it.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"Show me how, good father.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance\n"+
		"of her first affection: his unjust unkindness, that\n"+
		"in all reason should have quenched her love, hath,\n"+
		"like an impediment in the current, made it more\n"+
		"violent and unruly. Go you to Angelo; answer his\n"+
		"requiring with a plausible obedience; agree with\n"+
		"his demands to the point; only refer yourself to\n"+
		"this advantage, first, that your stay with him may\n"+
		"not be long; that the time may have all shadow and\n"+
		"silence in it; and the place answer to convenience.\n"+
		"This being granted in course,--and now follows\n"+
		"all,--we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up\n"+
		"your appointment, go in your place; if the encounter\n"+
		"acknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him to\n"+
		"her recompense: and here, by this, is your brother\n"+
		"saved, your honour untainted, the poor Mariana\n"+
		"advantaged, and the corrupt deputy scaled. The maid\n"+
		"will I frame and make fit for his attempt. If you\n"+
		"think well to carry this as you may, the doubleness\n"+
		"of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof.\n"+
		"What think you of it?\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"The image of it gives me content already; and I\n"+
		"trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"It lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily\n"+
		"to Angelo: if for this night he entreat you to his\n"+
		"bed, give him promise of satisfaction. I will\n"+
		"presently to Saint Luke's: there, at the moated\n"+
		"grange, resides this dejected Mariana. At that\n"+
		"place call upon me; and dispatch with Angelo, that\n"+
		"it may be quickly.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"I thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good father.\n"+
		"Exeunt severally\n"+
		"SCENE II. The street before the prison.\n"+
		"Enter, on one side, DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before; on the other, ELBOW, and Officers with POMPEY\n"+
		"ELBOW\n"+
		"Nay, if there be no remedy for it, but that you will\n"+
		"needs buy and sell men and women like beasts, we\n"+
		"shall have all the world drink brown and white bastard.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"O heavens! what stuff is here\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"'Twas never merry world since, of two usuries, the\n"+
		"merriest was put down, and the worser allowed by\n"+
		"order of law a furred gown to keep him warm; and\n"+
		"furred with fox and lamb-skins too, to signify, that\n"+
		"craft, being richer than innocency, stands for the facing.\n"+
		"ELBOW\n"+
		"Come your way, sir. 'Bless you, good father friar.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"And you, good brother father. What offence hath\n"+
		"this man made you, sir?\n"+
		"ELBOW\n"+
		"Marry, sir, he hath offended the law: and, sir, we\n"+
		"take him to be a thief too, sir; for we have found\n"+
		"upon him, sir, a strange picklock, which we have\n"+
		"sent to the deputy.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Fie, sirrah! a bawd, a wicked bawd!\n"+
		"The evil that thou causest to be done,\n"+
		"That is thy means to live. Do thou but think\n"+
		"What 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a back\n"+
		"From such a filthy vice: say to thyself,\n"+
		"From their abominable and beastly touches\n"+
		"I drink, I eat, array myself, and live.\n"+
		"Canst thou believe thy living is a life,\n"+
		"So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"Indeed, it does stink in some sort, sir; but yet,\n"+
		"sir, I would prove--\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin,\n"+
		"Thou wilt prove his. Take him to prison, officer:\n"+
		"Correction and instruction must both work\n"+
		"Ere this rude beast will profit.\n"+
		"ELBOW\n"+
		"He must before the deputy, sir; he has given him\n"+
		"warning: the deputy cannot abide a whoremaster: if\n"+
		"he be a whoremonger, and comes before him, he were\n"+
		"as good go a mile on his errand.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"That we were all, as some would seem to be,\n"+
		"From our faults, as faults from seeming, free!\n"+
		"ELBOW\n"+
		"His neck will come to your waist,--a cord, sir.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"I spy comfort; I cry bail. Here's a gentleman and a\n"+
		"friend of mine.\n"+
		"Enter LUCIO\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"How now, noble Pompey! What, at the wheels of\n"+
		"Caesar? art thou led in triumph? What, is there\n"+
		"none of Pygmalion's images, newly made woman, to be\n"+
		"had now, for putting the hand in the pocket and\n"+
		"extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What\n"+
		"sayest thou to this tune, matter and method? Is't\n"+
		"not drowned i' the last rain, ha? What sayest\n"+
		"thou, Trot? Is the world as it was, man? Which is\n"+
		"the way? Is it sad, and few words? or how? The\n"+
		"trick of it?\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Still thus, and thus; still worse!\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"How doth my dear morsel, thy mistress? Procures she\n"+
		"still, ha?\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"Troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and she\n"+
		"is herself in the tub.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"Why, 'tis good; it is the right of it; it must be\n"+
		"so: ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd:\n"+
		"an unshunned consequence; it must be so. Art going\n"+
		"to prison, Pompey?\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"Yes, faith, sir.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"Why, 'tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell: go, say I\n"+
		"sent thee thither. For debt, Pompey? or how?\n"+
		"ELBOW\n"+
		"For being a bawd, for being a bawd.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"Well, then, imprison him: if imprisonment be the\n"+
		"due of a bawd, why, 'tis his right: bawd is he\n"+
		"doubtless, and of antiquity too; bawd-born.\n"+
		"Farewell, good Pompey. Commend me to the prison,\n"+
		"Pompey: you will turn good husband now, Pompey; you\n"+
		"will keep the house.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"I hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"No, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the wear.\n"+
		"I will pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage: If\n"+
		"you take it not patiently, why, your mettle is the\n"+
		"more. Adieu, trusty Pompey. 'Bless you, friar.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"And you.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"Does Bridget paint still, Pompey, ha?\n"+
		"ELBOW\n"+
		"Come your ways, sir; come.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"You will not bail me, then, sir?\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"Then, Pompey, nor now. What news abroad, friar?\n"+
		"what news?\n"+
		"ELBOW\n"+
		"Come your ways, sir; come.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"Go to kennel, Pompey; go.\n"+
		"Exeunt ELBOW, POMPEY and Officers\n"+
		"What news, friar, of the duke?\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"I know none. Can you tell me of any?\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other\n"+
		"some, he is in Rome: but where is he, think you?\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from\n"+
		"the state, and usurp the beggary he was never born\n"+
		"to. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence; he\n"+
		"puts transgression to 't.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"He does well in 't.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in\n"+
		"him: something too crabbed that way, friar.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred;\n"+
		"it is well allied: but it is impossible to extirp\n"+
		"it quite, friar, till eating and drinking be put\n"+
		"down. They say this Angelo was not made by man and\n"+
		"woman after this downright way of creation: is it\n"+
		"true, think you?\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"How should he be made, then?\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"Some report a sea-maid spawned him; some, that he\n"+
		"was begot between two stock-fishes. But it is\n"+
		"certain that when he makes water his urine is\n"+
		"congealed ice; that I know to be true: and he is a\n"+
		"motion generative; that's infallible.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the\n"+
		"rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a\n"+
		"man! Would the duke that is absent have done this?\n"+
		"Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a\n"+
		"hundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing\n"+
		"a thousand: he had some feeling of the sport: he\n"+
		"knew the service, and that instructed him to mercy.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"I never heard the absent duke much detected for\n"+
		"women; he was not inclined that way.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"O, sir, you are deceived.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"'Tis not possible.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"Who, not the duke? yes, your beggar of fifty; and\n"+
		"his use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish: the\n"+
		"duke had crotchets in him. He would be drunk too;\n"+
		"that let me inform you.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"You do him wrong, surely.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the\n"+
		"duke: and I believe I know the cause of his\n"+
		"withdrawing.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"What, I prithee, might be the cause?\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"No, pardon; 'tis a secret must be locked within the\n"+
		"teeth and the lips: but this I can let you\n"+
		"understand, the greater file of the subject held the\n"+
		"duke to be wise.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Wise! why, no question but he was.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Either this is the envy in you, folly, or mistaking:\n"+
		"the very stream of his life and the business he hath\n"+
		"helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better\n"+
		"proclamation. Let him be but testimonied in his own\n"+
		"bringings-forth, and he shall appear to the\n"+
		"envious a scholar, a statesman and a soldier.\n"+
		"Therefore you speak unskilfully: or if your\n"+
		"knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"Sir, I know him, and I love him.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with\n"+
		"dearer love.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"Come, sir, I know what I know.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"I can hardly believe that, since you know not what\n"+
		"you speak. But, if ever the duke return, as our\n"+
		"prayers are he may, let me desire you to make your\n"+
		"answer before him. If it be honest you have spoke,\n"+
		"you have courage to maintain it: I am bound to call\n"+
		"upon you; and, I pray you, your name?\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"Sir, my name is Lucio; well known to the duke.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"He shall know you better, sir, if I may live to\n"+
		"report you.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"I fear you not.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"O, you hope the duke will return no more; or you\n"+
		"imagine me too unhurtful an opposite. But indeed I\n"+
		"can do you little harm; you'll forswear this again.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"I'll be hanged first: thou art deceived in me,\n"+
		"friar. But no more of this. Canst thou tell if\n"+
		"Claudio die to-morrow or no?\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Why should he die, sir?\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"Why? For filling a bottle with a tundish. I would\n"+
		"the duke we talk of were returned again: the\n"+
		"ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with\n"+
		"continency; sparrows must not build in his\n"+
		"house-eaves, because they are lecherous. The duke\n"+
		"yet would have dark deeds darkly answered; he would\n"+
		"never bring them to light: would he were returned!\n"+
		"Marry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing.\n"+
		"Farewell, good friar: I prithee, pray for me. The\n"+
		"duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on\n"+
		"Fridays. He's not past it yet, and I say to thee,\n"+
		"he would mouth with a beggar, though she smelt brown\n"+
		"bread and garlic: say that I said so. Farewell.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"No might nor greatness in mortality\n"+
		"Can censure 'scape; back-wounding calumny\n"+
		"The whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong\n"+
		"Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?\n"+
		"But who comes here?\n"+
		"Enter ESCALUS, Provost, and Officers with MISTRESS OVERDONE\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"Go; away with her to prison!\n"+
		"MISTRESS OVERDONE\n"+
		"Good my lord, be good to me; your honour is accounted\n"+
		"a merciful man; good my lord.\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"Double and treble admonition, and still forfeit in\n"+
		"the same kind! This would make mercy swear and play\n"+
		"the tyrant.\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"A bawd of eleven years' continuance, may it please\n"+
		"your honour.\n"+
		"MISTRESS OVERDONE\n"+
		"My lord, this is one Lucio's information against me.\n"+
		"Mistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him in the\n"+
		"duke's time; he promised her marriage: his child\n"+
		"is a year and a quarter old, come Philip and Jacob:\n"+
		"I have kept it myself; and see how he goes about to abuse me!\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"That fellow is a fellow of much licence: let him be\n"+
		"called before us. Away with her to prison! Go to;\n"+
		"no more words.\n"+
		"Exeunt Officers with MISTRESS OVERDONE\n"+
		"Provost, my brother Angelo will not be altered;\n"+
		"Claudio must die to-morrow: let him be furnished\n"+
		"with divines, and have all charitable preparation.\n"+
		"if my brother wrought by my pity, it should not be\n"+
		"so with him.\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"So please you, this friar hath been with him, and\n"+
		"advised him for the entertainment of death.\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"Good even, good father.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Bliss and goodness on you!\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"Of whence are you?\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Not of this country, though my chance is now\n"+
		"To use it for my time: I am a brother\n"+
		"Of gracious order, late come from the See\n"+
		"In special business from his holiness.\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"What news abroad i' the world?\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"None, but that there is so great a fever on\n"+
		"goodness, that the dissolution of it must cure it:\n"+
		"novelty is only in request; and it is as dangerous\n"+
		"to be aged in any kind of course, as it is virtuous\n"+
		"to be constant in any undertaking. There is scarce\n"+
		"truth enough alive to make societies secure; but\n"+
		"security enough to make fellowships accurst: much\n"+
		"upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. This\n"+
		"news is old enough, yet it is every day's news. I\n"+
		"pray you, sir, of what disposition was the duke?\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"One that, above all other strifes, contended\n"+
		"especially to know himself.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"What pleasure was he given to?\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"Rather rejoicing to see another merry, than merry at\n"+
		"any thing which professed to make him rejoice: a\n"+
		"gentleman of all temperance. But leave we him to\n"+
		"his events, with a prayer they may prove prosperous;\n"+
		"and let me desire to know how you find Claudio\n"+
		"prepared. I am made to understand that you have\n"+
		"lent him visitation.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"He professes to have received no sinister measure\n"+
		"from his judge, but most willingly humbles himself\n"+
		"to the determination of justice: yet had he framed\n"+
		"to himself, by the instruction of his frailty, many\n"+
		"deceiving promises of life; which I by my good\n"+
		"leisure have discredited to him, and now is he\n"+
		"resolved to die.\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"You have paid the heavens your function, and the\n"+
		"prisoner the very debt of your calling. I have\n"+
		"laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest\n"+
		"shore of my modesty: but my brother justice have I\n"+
		"found so severe, that he hath forced me to tell him\n"+
		"he is indeed Justice.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"If his own life answer the straitness of his\n"+
		"proceeding, it shall become him well; wherein if he\n"+
		"chance to fail, he hath sentenced himself.\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"I am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you well.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Peace be with you!\n"+
		"Exeunt ESCALUS and Provost\n"+
		"He who the sword of heaven will bear\n"+
		"Should be as holy as severe;\n"+
		"Pattern in himself to know,\n"+
		"Grace to stand, and virtue go;\n"+
		"More nor less to others paying\n"+
		"Than by self-offences weighing.\n"+
		"Shame to him whose cruel striking\n"+
		"Kills for faults of his own liking!\n"+
		"Twice treble shame on Angelo,\n"+
		"To weed my vice and let his grow!\n"+
		"O, what may man within him hide,\n"+
		"Though angel on the outward side!\n"+
		"How may likeness made in crimes,\n"+
		"Making practise on the times,\n"+
		"To draw with idle spiders' strings\n"+
		"Most ponderous and substantial things!\n"+

		"With Angelo to-night shall lie\n"+
		"His old betrothed but despised;\n"+
		"So disguise shall, by the disguised,\n"+

		"And perform an old contracting.\n"+

		"Enter MARIANA and a Boy\n"+
		"Boy sings\n"+
		"Take, O, take those lips away,\n"+
		"That so sweetly were forsworn;\n"+
		"And those eyes, the break of day,\n"+

		"But my kisses bring again, bring again;\n"+
		"Seals of love, but sealed in vain, sealed in vain.\n"+
		"MARIANA\n"+
		"Break off thy song, and haste thee quick away:\n"+
		"Here comes a man of comfort, whose advice\n"+
		"Hath often still'd my brawling discontent.\n"+
		"Exit Boy\n"+
		"Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before\n"+
		"I cry you mercy, sir; and well could wish\n"+
		"You had not found me here so musical:\n"+
		"Let me excuse me, and believe me so,\n"+
		"My mirth it much displeased, but pleased my woe.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"'Tis good; though music oft hath such a charm\n"+
		"To make bad good, and good provoke to harm.\n"+
		"I pray, you, tell me, hath any body inquired\n"+
		"for me here to-day? much upon this time have\n"+
		"I promised here to meet.\n"+
		"MARIANA\n"+
		"You have not been inquired after:\n"+
		"I have sat here all day.\n"+
		"Enter ISABELLA\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"I do constantly believe you. The time is come even\n"+
		"now. I shall crave your forbearance a little: may\n"+
		"be I will call upon you anon, for some advantage to yourself.\n"+
		"MARIANA\n"+
		"I am always bound to you.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Very well met, and well come.\n"+
		"What is the news from this good deputy?\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"He hath a garden circummured with brick,\n"+
		"Whose western side is with a vineyard back'd;\n"+
		"And to that vineyard is a planched gate,\n"+
		"That makes his opening with this bigger key:\n"+
		"This other doth command a little door\n"+
		"Which from the vineyard to the garden leads;\n"+
		"There have I made my promise\n"+
		"Upon the heavy middle of the night\n"+
		"To call upon him.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"But shall you on your knowledge find this way?\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"I have ta'en a due and wary note upon't:\n"+
		"With whispering and most guilty diligence,\n"+
		"In action all of precept, he did show me\n"+
		"The way twice o'er.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Are there no other tokens\n"+
		"Between you 'greed concerning her observance?\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"No, none, but only a repair i' the dark;\n"+
		"And that I have possess'd him my most stay\n"+
		"Can be but brief; for I have made him know\n"+
		"I have a servant comes with me along,\n"+
		"That stays upon me, whose persuasion is\n"+
		"I come about my brother.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"'Tis well borne up.\n"+
		"I have not yet made known to Mariana\n"+
		"A word of this. What, ho! within! come forth!\n"+
		"Re-enter MARIANA\n"+
		"I pray you, be acquainted with this maid;\n"+
		"She comes to do you good.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"I do desire the like.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Do you persuade yourself that I respect you?\n"+
		"MARIANA\n"+
		"Good friar, I know you do, and have found it.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Take, then, this your companion by the hand,\n"+
		"Who hath a story ready for your ear.\n"+
		"I shall attend your leisure: but make haste;\n"+
		"The vaporous night approaches.\n"+
		"MARIANA\n"+
		"Will't please you walk aside?\n"+
		"Exeunt MARIANA and ISABELLA\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"O place and greatness! millions of false eyes\n"+
		"Are stuck upon thee: volumes of report\n"+
		"Run with these false and most contrarious quests\n"+
		"Upon thy doings: thousand escapes of wit\n"+

		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"She'll take the enterprise upon her, father,\n"+

		"Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all.\n"+
		"He is your husband on a pre-contract:\n"+
		"To bring you thus together, 'tis no sin,\n"+
		"Sith that the justice of your title to him\n"+

		"Our corn's to reap, for yet our tithe's to sow.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. A room in the prison.\n"+
		"Enter Provost and POMPEY\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"Come hither, sirrah. Can you cut off a man's head?\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"If the man be a bachelor, sir, I can; but if he be a\n"+
		"married man, he's his wife's head, and I can never\n"+
		"cut off a woman's head.\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"Come, sir, leave me your snatches, and yield me a\n"+
		"direct answer. To-morrow morning are to die Claudio\n"+
		"and Barnardine. Here is in our prison a common\n"+
		"executioner, who in his office lacks a helper: if\n"+
		"you will take it on you to assist him, it shall\n"+
		"redeem you from your gyves; if not, you shall have\n"+
		"your full time of imprisonment and your deliverance\n"+
		"with an unpitied whipping, for you have been a\n"+
		"notorious bawd.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"Sir, I have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind;\n"+
		"but yet I will be content to be a lawful hangman. I\n"+
		"would be glad to receive some instruction from my\n"+
		"fellow partner.\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"What, ho! Abhorson! Where's Abhorson, there?\n"+
		"Enter ABHORSON\n"+
		"ABHORSON\n"+
		"Do you call, sir?\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"Sirrah, here's a fellow will help you to-morrow in\n"+
		"your execution. If you think it meet, compound with\n"+
		"him by the year, and let him abide here with you; if\n"+
		"not, use him for the present and dismiss him. He\n"+
		"cannot plead his estimation with you; he hath been a bawd.\n"+
		"ABHORSON\n"+
		"A bawd, sir? fie upon him! he will discredit our mystery.\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"Go to, sir; you weigh equally; a feather will turn\n"+
		"the scale.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"Pray, sir, by your good favour,--for surely, sir, a\n"+
		"good favour you have, but that you have a hanging\n"+
		"look,--do you call, sir, your occupation a mystery?\n"+
		"ABHORSON\n"+
		"Ay, sir; a mystery\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"Painting, sir, I have heard say, is a mystery; and\n"+
		"your whores, sir, being members of my occupation,\n"+
		"using painting, do prove my occupation a mystery:\n"+
		"but what mystery there should be in hanging, if I\n"+
		"should be hanged, I cannot imagine.\n"+
		"ABHORSON\n"+
		"Sir, it is a mystery.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"Proof?\n"+
		"ABHORSON\n"+
		"Every true man's apparel fits your thief: if it be\n"+
		"too little for your thief, your true man thinks it\n"+
		"big enough; if it be too big for your thief, your\n"+
		"thief thinks it little enough: so every true man's\n"+
		"apparel fits your thief.\n"+
		"Re-enter Provost\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"Are you agreed?\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"Sir, I will serve him; for I do find your hangman is\n"+
		"a more penitent trade than your bawd; he doth\n"+
		"oftener ask forgiveness.\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"You, sirrah, provide your block and your axe\n"+
		"to-morrow four o'clock.\n"+
		"ABHORSON\n"+
		"Come on, bawd; I will instruct thee in my trade; follow.\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"I do desire to learn, sir: and I hope, if you have\n"+
		"occasion to use me for your own turn, you shall find\n"+
		"me yare; for truly, sir, for your kindness I owe you\n"+
		"a good turn.\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"Call hither Barnardine and Claudio:\n"+
		"Exeunt POMPEY and ABHORSON\n"+
		"The one has my pity; not a jot the other,\n"+
		"Being a murderer, though he were my brother.\n"+
		"Enter CLAUDIO\n"+
		"Look, here's the warrant, Claudio, for thy death:\n"+
		"'Tis now dead midnight, and by eight to-morrow\n"+
		"Thou must be made immortal. Where's Barnardine?\n"+
		"CLAUDIO\n"+
		"As fast lock'd up in sleep as guiltless labour\n"+
		"When it lies starkly in the traveller's bones:\n"+
		"He will not wake.\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"Who can do good on him?\n"+
		"Well, go, prepare yourself.\n"+
		"Knocking within\n"+
		"But, hark, what noise?\n"+
		"Heaven give your spirits comfort!\n"+
		"Exit CLAUDIO\n"+
		"By and by.\n"+
		"I hope it is some pardon or reprieve\n"+
		"For the most gentle Claudio.\n"+
		"Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before\n"+
		"Welcome father.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"The best and wholesomest spirts of the night\n"+
		"Envelope you, good Provost! Who call'd here of late?\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"None, since the curfew rung.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Not Isabel?\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"No.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"They will, then, ere't be long.\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"What comfort is for Claudio?\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"There's some in hope.\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"It is a bitter deputy.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Not so, not so; his life is parallel'd\n"+
		"Even with the stroke and line of his great justice:\n"+
		"He doth with holy abstinence subdue\n"+
		"That in himself which he spurs on his power\n"+
		"To qualify in others: were he meal'd with that\n"+
		"Which he corrects, then were he tyrannous;\n"+
		"But this being so, he's just.\n"+
		"Knocking within\n"+
		"Now are they come.\n"+
		"Exit Provost\n"+
		"This is a gentle provost: seldom when\n"+
		"The steeled gaoler is the friend of men.\n"+
		"Knocking within\n"+
		"How now! what noise? That spirit's possessed with haste\n"+
		"That wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes.\n"+
		"Re-enter Provost\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"There he must stay until the officer\n"+
		"Arise to let him in: he is call'd up.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Have you no countermand for Claudio yet,\n"+
		"But he must die to-morrow?\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"None, sir, none.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"As near the dawning, provost, as it is,\n"+
		"You shall hear more ere morning.\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"Happily\n"+
		"You something know; yet I believe there comes\n"+
		"No countermand; no such example have we:\n"+
		"Besides, upon the very siege of justice\n"+
		"Lord Angelo hath to the public ear\n"+
		"Profess'd the contrary.\n"+
		"Enter a Messenger\n"+
		"This is his lordship's man.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"And here comes Claudio's pardon.\n"+
		"Messenger\n"+
		"[Giving a paper]\n"+
		"My lord hath sent you this note; and by me this\n"+
		"further charge, that you swerve not from the\n"+
		"smallest article of it, neither in time, matter, or\n"+
		"other circumstance. Good morrow; for, as I take it,\n"+
		"it is almost day.\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"I shall obey him.\n"+
		"Exit Messenger\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"[Aside] This is his pardon, purchased by such sin\n"+
		"For which the pardoner himself is in.\n"+
		"Hence hath offence his quick celerity,\n"+
		"When it is born in high authority:\n"+
		"When vice makes mercy, mercy's so extended,\n"+
		"That for the fault's love is the offender friended.\n"+
		"Now, sir, what news?\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"I told you. Lord Angelo, belike thinking me remiss\n"+
		"in mine office, awakens me with this unwonted\n"+
		"putting-on; methinks strangely, for he hath not used it before.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Pray you, let's hear.\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"[Reads]\n"+
		"'Whatsoever you may hear to the contrary, let\n"+
		"Claudio be executed by four of the clock; and in the\n"+
		"afternoon Barnardine: for my better satisfaction,\n"+
		"let me have Claudio's head sent me by five. Let\n"+
		"this be duly performed; with a thought that more\n"+
		"depends on it than we must yet deliver. Thus fail\n"+
		"not to do your office, as you will answer it at your peril.'\n"+
		"What say you to this, sir?\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"What is that Barnardine who is to be executed in the\n"+
		"afternoon?\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"A Bohemian born, but here nursed un and bred; one\n"+
		"that is a prisoner nine years old.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"How came it that the absent duke had not either\n"+
		"delivered him to his liberty or executed him? I\n"+
		"have heard it was ever his manner to do so.\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"His friends still wrought reprieves for him: and,\n"+
		"indeed, his fact, till now in the government of Lord\n"+
		"Angelo, came not to an undoubtful proof.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"It is now apparent?\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"Most manifest, and not denied by himself.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Hath he born himself penitently in prison? how\n"+
		"seems he to be touched?\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but\n"+
		"as a drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and fearless\n"+
		"of what's past, present, or to come; insensible of\n"+
		"mortality, and desperately mortal.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"He wants advice.\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"He will hear none: he hath evermore had the liberty\n"+
		"of the prison; give him leave to escape hence, he\n"+
		"would not: drunk many times a day, if not many days\n"+
		"entirely drunk. We have very oft awaked him, as if\n"+
		"to carry him to execution, and showed him a seeming\n"+
		"warrant for it: it hath not moved him at all.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"More of him anon. There is written in your brow,\n"+
		"provost, honesty and constancy: if I read it not\n"+
		"truly, my ancient skill beguiles me; but, in the\n"+
		"boldness of my cunning, I will lay myself in hazard.\n"+
		"Claudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, is\n"+
		"no greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hath\n"+
		"sentenced him. To make you understand this in a\n"+
		"manifested effect, I crave but four days' respite;\n"+
		"for the which you are to do me both a present and a\n"+
		"dangerous courtesy.\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"Pray, sir, in what?\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"In the delaying death.\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"A lack, how may I do it, having the hour limited,\n"+
		"and an express command, under penalty, to deliver\n"+
		"his head in the view of Angelo? I may make my case\n"+
		"as Claudio's, to cross this in the smallest.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"By the vow of mine order I warrant you, if my\n"+
		"instructions may be your guide. Let this Barnardine\n"+
		"be this morning executed, and his head born to Angelo.\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"Angelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"O, death's a great disguiser; and you may add to it.\n"+
		"Shave the head, and tie the beard; and say it was\n"+
		"the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his\n"+
		"death: you know the course is common. If any thing\n"+
		"fall to you upon this, more than thanks and good\n"+
		"fortune, by the saint whom I profess, I will plead\n"+
		"against it with my life.\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"Pardon me, good father; it is against my oath.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Were you sworn to the duke, or to the deputy?\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"To him, and to his substitutes.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"You will think you have made no offence, if the duke\n"+
		"avouch the justice of your dealing?\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"But what likelihood is in that?\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Not a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I see\n"+
		"you fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, nor\n"+
		"persuasion can with ease attempt you, I will go\n"+
		"further than I meant, to pluck all fears out of you.\n"+
		"Look you, sir, here is the hand and seal of the\n"+
		"duke: you know the character, I doubt not; and the\n"+
		"signet is not strange to you.\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"I know them both.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"The contents of this is the return of the duke: you\n"+
		"shall anon over-read it at your pleasure; where you\n"+
		"shall find, within these two days he will be here.\n"+
		"This is a thing that Angelo knows not; for he this\n"+
		"very day receives letters of strange tenor;\n"+
		"perchance of the duke's death; perchance entering\n"+
		"into some monastery; but, by chance, nothing of what\n"+
		"is writ. Look, the unfolding star calls up the\n"+
		"shepherd. Put not yourself into amazement how these\n"+
		"things should be: all difficulties are but easy\n"+
		"when they are known. Call your executioner, and off\n"+
		"with Barnardine's head: I will give him a present\n"+
		"shrift and advise him for a better place. Yet you\n"+
		"are amazed; but this shall absolutely resolve you.\n"+
		"Come away; it is almost clear dawn.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE III. Another room in the same.\n"+
		"Enter POMPEY\n"+
		"POMPEY\n"+
		"I am as well acquainted here as I was in our house\n"+
		"of profession: one would think it were Mistress\n"+
		"Overdone's own house, for here be many of her old\n"+
		"customers. First, here's young Master Rash; he's in\n"+
		"for a commodity of brown paper and old ginger,\n"+
		"ninescore and seventeen pounds; of which he made\n"+
		"five marks, ready money: marry, then ginger was not\n"+
		"much in request, for the old women were all dead.\n"+
		"Then is there here one Master Caper, at the suit of\n"+
		"Master Three-pile the mercer, for some four suits of\n"+
		"peach-coloured satin, which now peaches him a\n"+
		"beggar. Then have we here young Dizy, and young\n"+
		"Master Deep-vow, and Master Copperspur, and Master\n"+
		"Starve-lackey the rapier and dagger man, and young\n"+

		"Now, sir, how do you find the prisoner?\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"A creature unprepared, unmeet for death;\n"+
		"And to transport him in the mind he is\n"+

		"Provost\n"+
		"Here in the prison, father,\n"+
		"There died this morning of a cruel fever\n"+
		"One Ragozine, a most notorious pirate,\n"+
		"A man of Claudio's years; his beard and head\n"+
		"Just of his colour. What if we do omit\n"+
		"This reprobate till he were well inclined;\n"+
		"And satisfy the deputy with the visage\n"+
		"Of Ragozine, more like to Claudio?\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"O, 'tis an accident that heaven provides!\n"+
		"Dispatch it presently; the hour draws on\n"+
		"Prefix'd by Angelo: see this be done,\n"+
		"And sent according to command; whiles I\n"+
		"Persuade this rude wretch willingly to die.\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"This shall be done, good father, presently.\n"+

		"To save me from the danger that might come\n"+
		"If he were known alive?\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Let this be done.\n"+
		"Put them in secret holds, both Barnardine and Claudio:\n"+
		"Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting\n"+
		"To the under generation, you shall find\n"+
		"Your safety manifested.\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"I am your free dependant.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Quick, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo.\n"+
		"Exit Provost\n"+
		"Now will I write letters to Angelo,--\n"+
		"The provost, he shall bear them, whose contents\n"+
		"Shall witness to him I am near at home,\n"+
		"And that, by great injunctions, I am bound\n"+
		"To enter publicly: him I'll desire\n"+
		"To meet me at the consecrated fount\n"+
		"A league below the city; and from thence,\n"+
		"By cold gradation and well-balanced form,\n"+
		"We shall proceed with Angelo.\n"+
		"Re-enter Provost\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"Here is the head; I'll carry it myself.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Convenient is it. Make a swift return;\n"+

		"Exit\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"[Within] Peace, ho, be here!\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"The tongue of Isabel. She's come to know\n"+

		"When it is least expected.\n"+

		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"Ho, by your leave!\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Good morning to you, fair and gracious daughter.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"The better, given me by so holy a man.\n"+
		"Hath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon?\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"He hath released him, Isabel, from the world:\n"+
		"His head is off and sent to Angelo.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"Nay, but it is not so.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"It is no other: show your wisdom, daughter,\n"+
		"In your close patience.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"O, I will to him and pluck out his eyes!\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"You shall not be admitted to his sight.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"Unhappy Claudio! wretched Isabel!\n"+
		"Injurious world! most damned Angelo!\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot;\n"+
		"Forbear it therefore; give your cause to heaven.\n"+
		"Mark what I say, which you shall find\n"+
		"By every syllable a faithful verity:\n"+
		"The duke comes home to-morrow; nay, dry your eyes;\n"+
		"One of our convent, and his confessor,\n"+
		"Gives me this instance: already he hath carried\n"+
		"Notice to Escalus and Angelo,\n"+
		"Who do prepare to meet him at the gates,\n"+
		"There to give up their power. If you can, pace your wisdom\n"+
		"In that good path that I would wish it go,\n"+
		"And you shall have your bosom on this wretch,\n"+
		"Grace of the duke, revenges to your heart,\n"+
		"And general honour.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"I am directed by you.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"This letter, then, to Friar Peter give;\n"+
		"'Tis that he sent me of the duke's return:\n"+
		"Say, by this token, I desire his company\n"+
		"At Mariana's house to-night. Her cause and yours\n"+
		"I'll perfect him withal, and he shall bring you\n"+
		"Before the duke, and to the head of Angelo\n"+
		"Accuse him home and home. For my poor self,\n"+
		"I am combined by a sacred vow\n"+
		"And shall be absent. Wend you with this letter:\n"+
		"Command these fretting waters from your eyes\n"+
		"With a light heart; trust not my holy order,\n"+
		"If I pervert your course. Who's here?\n"+
		"Enter LUCIO\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"Good even. Friar, where's the provost?\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Not within, sir.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"O pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to see\n"+
		"thine eyes so red: thou must be patient. I am fain\n"+
		"to dine and sup with water and bran; I dare not for\n"+
		"my head fill my belly; one fruitful meal would set\n"+
		"me to 't. But they say the duke will be here\n"+
		"to-morrow. By my troth, Isabel, I loved thy brother:\n"+
		"if the old fantastical duke of dark corners had been\n"+
		"at home, he had lived.\n"+
		"Exit ISABELLA\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Sir, the duke is marvellous little beholding to your\n"+
		"reports; but the best is, he lives not in them.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"Friar, thou knowest not the duke so well as I do:\n"+
		"he's a better woodman than thou takest him for.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Well, you'll answer this one day. Fare ye well.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"Nay, tarry; I'll go along with thee\n"+
		"I can tell thee pretty tales of the duke.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"You have told me too many of him already, sir, if\n"+
		"they be true; if not true, none were enough.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"I was once before him for getting a wench with child.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Did you such a thing?\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"Yes, marry, did I but I was fain to forswear it;\n"+
		"they would else have married me to the rotten medlar.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Sir, your company is fairer than honest. Rest you well.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"By my troth, I'll go with thee to the lane's end:\n"+
		"if bawdy talk offend you, we'll have very little of\n"+
		"it. Nay, friar, I am a kind of burr; I shall stick.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE IV. A room in ANGELO's house.\n"+
		"Enter ANGELO and ESCALUS\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"Every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"In most uneven and distracted manner. His actions\n"+
		"show much like to madness: pray heaven his wisdom be\n"+
		"not tainted! And why meet him at the gates, and\n"+
		"redeliver our authorities there\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"I guess not.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"And why should we proclaim it in an hour before his\n"+
		"entering, that if any crave redress of injustice,\n"+
		"they should exhibit their petitions in the street?\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"He shows his reason for that: to have a dispatch of\n"+
		"complaints, and to deliver us from devices\n"+
		"hereafter, which shall then have no power to stand\n"+
		"against us.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Well, I beseech you, let it be proclaimed betimes\n"+
		"i' the morn; I'll call you at your house: give\n"+
		"notice to such men of sort and suit as are to meet\n"+
		"him.\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"I shall, sir. Fare you well.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"Good night.\n"+
		"Exit ESCALUS\n"+
		"This deed unshapes me quite, makes me unpregnant\n"+
		"And dull to all proceedings. A deflower'd maid!\n"+
		"And by an eminent body that enforced\n"+
		"The law against it! But that her tender shame\n"+
		"Will not proclaim against her maiden loss,\n"+
		"How might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no;\n"+
		"For my authority bears of a credent bulk,\n"+
		"That no particular scandal once can touch\n"+
		"But it confounds the breather. He should have lived,\n"+
		"Save that riotous youth, with dangerous sense,\n"+
		"Might in the times to come have ta'en revenge,\n"+
		"By so receiving a dishonour'd life\n"+
		"With ransom of such shame. Would yet he had lived!\n"+
		"A lack, when once our grace we have forgot,\n"+
		"Nothing goes right: we would, and we would not.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE V. Fields without the town.\n"+
		"Enter DUKE VINCENTIO in his own habit, and FRIAR PETER\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"These letters at fit time deliver me\n"+
		"Giving letters\n"+
		"The provost knows our purpose and our plot.\n"+
		"The matter being afoot, keep your instruction,\n"+
		"And hold you ever to our special drift;\n"+
		"Though sometimes you do blench from this to that,\n"+
		"As cause doth minister. Go call at Flavius' house,\n"+
		"And tell him where I stay: give the like notice\n"+
		"To Valentinus, Rowland, and to Crassus,\n"+
		"And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate;\n"+
		"But send me Flavius first.\n"+
		"FRIAR PETER\n"+
		"It shall be speeded well.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"Enter VARRIUS\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"I thank thee, Varrius; thou hast made good haste:\n"+
		"Come, we will walk. There's other of our friends\n"+
		"Will greet us here anon, my gentle Varrius.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE VI. Street near the city gate.\n"+
		"Enter ISABELLA and MARIANA\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"To speak so indirectly I am loath:\n"+
		"I would say the truth; but to accuse him so,\n"+
		"That is your part: yet I am advised to do it;\n"+
		"He says, to veil full purpose.\n"+
		"MARIANA\n"+
		"Be ruled by him.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"Besides, he tells me that, if peradventure\n"+
		"He speak against me on the adverse side,\n"+
		"I should not think it strange; for 'tis a physic\n"+
		"That's bitter to sweet end.\n"+
		"MARIANA\n"+
		"I would Friar Peter--\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"O, peace! the friar is come.\n"+
		"Enter FRIAR PETER\n"+
		"FRIAR PETER\n"+
		"Come, I have found you out a stand most fit,\n"+
		"Where you may have such vantage on the duke,\n"+
		"He shall not pass you. Twice have the trumpets sounded;\n"+
		"The generous and gravest citizens\n"+
		"Have hent the gates, and very near upon\n"+
		"The duke is entering: therefore, hence, away!\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT V\n"+
		"SCENE I. The city gate.\n"+
		"MARIANA veiled, ISABELLA, and FRIAR PETER, at their stand. Enter DUKE VINCENTIO, VARRIUS, Lords, ANGELO, ESCALUS, LUCIO, Provost, Officers, and Citizens, at several doors\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"My very worthy cousin, fairly met!\n"+
		"Our old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"Happy return be to your royal grace!\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Many and hearty thankings to you both.\n"+
		"We have made inquiry of you; and we hear\n"+
		"Such goodness of your justice, that our soul\n"+
		"Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks,\n"+
		"Forerunning more requital.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"You make my bonds still greater.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"O, your desert speaks loud; and I should wrong it,\n"+
		"To lock it in the wards of covert bosom,\n"+
		"When it deserves, with characters of brass,\n"+
		"A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time\n"+
		"And razure of oblivion. Give me your hand,\n"+
		"And let the subject see, to make them know\n"+
		"That outward courtesies would fain proclaim\n"+
		"Favours that keep within. Come, Escalus,\n"+
		"You must walk by us on our other hand;\n"+
		"And good supporters are you.\n"+
		"FRIAR PETER and ISABELLA come forward\n"+
		"FRIAR PETER\n"+
		"Now is your time: speak loud and kneel before him.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"Justice, O royal duke! Vail your regard\n"+
		"Upon a wrong'd, I would fain have said, a maid!\n"+
		"O worthy prince, dishonour not your eye\n"+
		"By throwing it on any other object\n"+
		"Till you have heard me in my true complaint\n"+
		"And given me justice, justice, justice, justice!\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief.\n"+
		"Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice:\n"+
		"Reveal yourself to him.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"O worthy duke,\n"+
		"You bid me seek redemption of the devil:\n"+
		"Hear me yourself; for that which I must speak\n"+
		"Must either punish me, not being believed,\n"+
		"Or wring redress from you. Hear me, O hear me, here!\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm:\n"+
		"She hath been a suitor to me for her brother\n"+
		"Cut off by course of justice,--\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"By course of justice!\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"And she will speak most bitterly and strange.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"Most strange, but yet most truly, will I speak:\n"+
		"That Angelo's forsworn; is it not strange?\n"+
		"That Angelo's a murderer; is 't not strange?\n"+
		"That Angelo is an adulterous thief,\n"+
		"An hypocrite, a virgin-violator;\n"+
		"Is it not strange and strange?\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Nay, it is ten times strange.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"It is not truer he is Angelo\n"+
		"Than this is all as true as it is strange:\n"+
		"Nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth\n"+
		"To the end of reckoning.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Away with her! Poor soul,\n"+
		"She speaks this in the infirmity of sense.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"O prince, I conjure thee, as thou believest\n"+
		"There is another comfort than this world,\n"+
		"That thou neglect me not, with that opinion\n"+
		"That I am touch'd with madness! Make not impossible\n"+
		"That which but seems unlike: 'tis not impossible\n"+
		"But one, the wicked'st caitiff on the ground,\n"+
		"May seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute\n"+
		"As Angelo; even so may Angelo,\n"+
		"In all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,\n"+
		"Be an arch-villain; believe it, royal prince:\n"+
		"If he be less, he's nothing; but he's more,\n"+
		"Had I more name for badness.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"By mine honesty,\n"+
		"If she be mad,--as I believe no other,--\n"+
		"Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,\n"+
		"Such a dependency of thing on thing,\n"+
		"As e'er I heard in madness.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"O gracious duke,\n"+
		"Harp not on that, nor do not banish reason\n"+
		"For inequality; but let your reason serve\n"+
		"To make the truth appear where it seems hid,\n"+
		"And hide the false seems true.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Many that are not mad\n"+
		"Have, sure, more lack of reason. What would you say?\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"I am the sister of one Claudio,\n"+
		"Condemn'd upon the act of fornication\n"+
		"To lose his head; condemn'd by Angelo:\n"+
		"I, in probation of a sisterhood,\n"+
		"Was sent to by my brother; one Lucio\n"+
		"As then the messenger,--\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"That's I, an't like your grace:\n"+
		"I came to her from Claudio, and desired her\n"+
		"To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo\n"+
		"For her poor brother's pardon.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"That's he indeed.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"You were not bid to speak.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"No, my good lord;\n"+
		"Nor wish'd to hold my peace.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"I wish you now, then;\n"+
		"Pray you, take note of it: and when you have\n"+
		"A business for yourself, pray heaven you then\n"+
		"Be perfect.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"I warrant your honour.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"The warrants for yourself; take heed to't.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"This gentleman told somewhat of my tale,--\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"Right.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"It may be right; but you are i' the wrong\n"+
		"To speak before your time. Proceed.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"I went\n"+
		"To this pernicious caitiff deputy,--\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"That's somewhat madly spoken.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"Pardon it;\n"+
		"The phrase is to the matter.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Mended again. The matter; proceed.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"In brief, to set the needless process by,\n"+
		"How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd,\n"+
		"How he refell'd me, and how I replied,--\n"+
		"For this was of much length,--the vile conclusion\n"+
		"I now begin with grief and shame to utter:\n"+
		"He would not, but by gift of my chaste body\n"+
		"To his concupiscible intemperate lust,\n"+
		"Release my brother; and, after much debatement,\n"+
		"My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,\n"+
		"And I did yield to him: but the next morn betimes,\n"+
		"His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant\n"+
		"For my poor brother's head.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"This is most likely!\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"O, that it were as like as it is true!\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"By heaven, fond wretch, thou knowist not what thou speak'st,\n"+
		"Or else thou art suborn'd against his honour\n"+
		"In hateful practise. First, his integrity\n"+
		"Stands without blemish. Next, it imports no reason\n"+
		"That with such vehemency he should pursue\n"+
		"Faults proper to himself: if he had so offended,\n"+
		"He would have weigh'd thy brother by himself\n"+
		"And not have cut him off. Some one hath set you on:\n"+
		"Confess the truth, and say by whose advice\n"+
		"Thou camest here to complain.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"And is this all?\n"+
		"Then, O you blessed ministers above,\n"+
		"Keep me in patience, and with ripen'd time\n"+
		"Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up\n"+
		"In countenance! Heaven shield your grace from woe,\n"+
		"As I, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go!\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"I know you'ld fain be gone. An officer!\n"+
		"To prison with her! Shall we thus permit\n"+
		"A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall\n"+
		"On him so near us? This needs must be a practise.\n"+
		"Who knew of Your intent and coming hither?\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"A ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick?\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"My lord, I know him; 'tis a meddling friar;\n"+
		"I do not like the man: had he been lay, my lord\n"+
		"For certain words he spake against your grace\n"+
		"In your retirement, I had swinged him soundly.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Words against me? this is a good friar, belike!\n"+
		"And to set on this wretched woman here\n"+
		"Against our substitute! Let this friar be found.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"But yesternight, my lord, she and that friar,\n"+
		"I saw them at the prison: a saucy friar,\n"+
		"A very scurvy fellow.\n"+
		"FRIAR PETER\n"+
		"Blessed be your royal grace!\n"+
		"I have stood by, my lord, and I have heard\n"+
		"Your royal ear abused. First, hath this woman\n"+
		"Most wrongfully accused your substitute,\n"+
		"Who is as free from touch or soil with her\n"+
		"As she from one ungot.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"We did believe no less.\n"+
		"Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?\n"+
		"FRIAR PETER\n"+
		"I know him for a man divine and holy;\n"+
		"Not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler,\n"+
		"As he's reported by this gentleman;\n"+
		"And, on my trust, a man that never yet\n"+
		"Did, as he vouches, misreport your grace.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"My lord, most villanously; believe it.\n"+

		"Well, he in time may come to clear himself;\n"+
		"But at this instant he is sick my lord,\n"+
		"Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request,\n"+
		"Being come to knowledge that there was complaint\n"+
		"Intended 'gainst Lord Angelo, came I hither,\n"+
		"To speak, as from his mouth, what he doth know\n"+
		"Is true and false; and what he with his oath\n"+
		"And all probation will make up full clear,\n"+
		"Whensoever he's convented. First, for this woman.\n"+
		"To justify this worthy nobleman,\n"+
		"So vulgarly and personally accused,\n"+
		"Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes,\n"+
		"Till she herself confess it.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Good friar, let's hear it.\n"+
		"ISABELLA is carried off guarded; and MARIANA comes forward\n"+
		"Do you not smile at this, Lord Angelo?\n"+
		"O heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!\n"+
		"Give us some seats. Come, cousin Angelo;\n"+
		"In this I'll be impartial; be you judge\n"+
		"Of your own cause. Is this the witness, friar?\n"+
		"First, let her show her face, and after speak.\n"+
		"MARIANA\n"+
		"Pardon, my lord; I will not show my face\n"+
		"Until my husband bid me.\n"+

		"What, are you married?\n"+
		"MARIANA\n"+
		"No, my lord.\n"+

		"No, my lord.\n"+

		"A widow, then?\n"+
		"MARIANA\n"+
		"Neither, my lord.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Why, you are nothing then: neither maid, widow, nor wife?\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"My lord, she may be a punk; for many of them are\n"+
		"neither maid, widow, nor wife.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Silence that fellow: I would he had some cause\n"+

		"LUCIO\n"+
		"Well, my lord.\n"+
		"MARIANA\n"+
		"My lord; I do confess I ne'er was married;\n"+
		"And I confess besides I am no maid:\n"+
		"I have known my husband; yet my husband\n"+
		"Knows not that ever he knew me.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"He was drunk then, my lord: it can be no better.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too!\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"Well, my lord.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"This is no witness for Lord Angelo.\n"+
		"MARIANA\n"+
		"Now I come to't my lord\n"+
		"She that accuses him of fornication,\n"+
		"In self-same manner doth accuse my husband,\n"+
		"And charges him my lord, with such a time\n"+
		"When I'll depose I had him in mine arms\n"+
		"With all the effect of love.\n"+

		"Not that I know.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"No? you say your husband.\n"+
		"MARIANA\n"+
		"Why, just, my lord, and that is Angelo,\n"+
		"Who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body,\n"+
		"But knows he thinks that he knows Isabel's.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"This is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face.\n"+
		"MARIANA\n"+
		"My husband bids me; now I will unmask.\n"+
		"Unveiling\n"+
		"This is that face, thou cruel Angelo,\n"+
		"Which once thou sworest was worth the looking on;\n"+
		"This is the hand which, with a vow'd contract,\n"+
		"Was fast belock'd in thine; this is the body\n"+
		"That took away the match from Isabel,\n"+
		"And did supply thee at thy garden-house\n"+
		"In her imagined person.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Know you this woman?\n"+

		"Carnally, she says.\n"+

		"Sirrah, no more!\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"Enough, my lord.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"My lord, I must confess I know this woman:\n"+
		"And five years since there was some speech of marriage\n"+
		"Betwixt myself and her; which was broke off,\n"+
		"Partly for that her promised proportions\n"+
		"Came short of composition, but in chief\n"+
		"For that her reputation was disvalued\n"+
		"In levity: since which time of five years\n"+

		"Upon my faith and honour.\n"+
		"MARIANA\n"+

		"As there comes light from heaven and words from breath,\n"+

		"Or else for ever be confixed here,\n"+
		"A marble monument!\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"I did but smile till now:\n"+
		"Now, good my lord, give me the scope of justice\n"+
		"My patience here is touch'd. I do perceive\n"+
		"These poor informal women are no more\n"+

		"To find this practise out.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+

		"And punish them to your height of pleasure.\n"+
		"Thou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman,\n"+
		"Compact with her that's gone, think'st thou thy oaths,\n"+
		"Though they would swear down each particular saint,\n"+
		"Were testimonies against his worth and credit\n"+
		"That's seal'd in approbation? You, Lord Escalus,\n"+
		"Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains\n"+
		"To find out this abuse, whence 'tis derived.\n"+
		"There is another friar that set them on;\n"+
		"Let him be sent for.\n"+
		"FRIAR PETER\n"+
		"Would he were here, my lord! for he indeed\n"+
		"Hath set the women on to this complaint:\n"+

		"Friar Lodowick to be a dishonest person?\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"'Cucullus non facit monachum:' honest in nothing\n"+

		"Say you?\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"Marry, sir, I think, if you handled her privately,\n"+

		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"The duke's in us; and we will hear you speak:\n"+

		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Boldly, at least. But, O, poor souls,\n"+
		"Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox?\n"+
		"Good night to your redress! Is the duke gone?\n"+
		"Then is your cause gone too. The duke's unjust,\n"+
		"Thus to retort your manifest appeal,\n"+
		"And put your trial in the villain's mouth\n"+
		"Which here you come to accuse.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"This is the rascal; this is he I spoke of.\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"Why, thou unreverend and unhallow'd friar,\n"+
		"Is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women\n"+
		"To accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouth\n"+
		"And in the witness of his proper ear,\n"+
		"To call him villain? and then to glance from him\n"+
		"To the duke himself, to tax him with injustice?\n"+
		"Take him hence; to the rack with him! We'll touse you\n"+
		"Joint by joint, but we will know his purpose.\n"+
		"What 'unjust'!\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Be not so hot; the duke\n"+
		"Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he\n"+
		"Dare rack his own: his subject am I not,\n"+
		"Nor here provincial. My business in this state\n"+
		"Made me a looker on here in Vienna,\n"+
		"Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble\n"+
		"Till it o'er-run the stew; laws for all faults,\n"+
		"But faults so countenanced, that the strong statutes\n"+
		"Stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop,\n"+
		"As much in mock as mark.\n"+
		"ESCALUS\n"+
		"Slander to the state! Away with him to prison!\n"+

		"What can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio?\n"+
		"Is this the man that you did tell us of?\n"+

		"LUCIO\n"+
		"O, did you so? And do you remember what you said of the duke?\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Most notedly, sir.\n"+
		"LUCIO\n"+
		"Do you so, sir? And was the duke a fleshmonger, a\n"+

		"LUCIO\n"+
		"Come, sir; come, sir; come, sir; foh, sir! Why, you\n"+
		"bald-pated, lying rascal, you must be hooded, must\n"+
		"you? Show your knave's visage, with a pox to you!\n"+
		"show your sheep-biting face, and be hanged an hour!\n"+

		"O, give me pardon,\n"+

		"It was the swift celerity of his death,\n"+
		"Which I did think with slower foot came on,\n"+

		"For this new-married man approaching here,\n"+

		"For Mariana's sake: but as he adjudged your brother,--\n"+
		"Being criminal, in double violation\n"+
		"Of sacred chastity and of promise-breach\n"+
		"Thereon dependent, for your brother's life,--\n"+
		"The very mercy of the law cries out\n"+
		"Most audible, even from his proper tongue,\n"+
		"'An Angelo for Claudio, death for death!'\n"+

		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Against all sense you do importune her:\n"+

		"MARIANA\n"+
		"Isabel,\n"+
		"Sweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by me;\n"+
		"Hold up your hands, say nothing; I'll speak all.\n"+
		"They say, best men are moulded out of faults;\n"+
		"And, for the most, become much more the better\n"+
		"For being a little bad: so may my husband.\n"+
		"O Isabel, will you not lend a knee?\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"He dies for Claudio's death.\n"+
		"ISABELLA\n"+
		"Most bounteous sir,\n"+

		"Look, if it please you, on this man condemn'd,\n"+
		"As if my brother lived: I partly think\n"+
		"A due sincerity govern'd his deeds,\n"+
		"Till he did look on me: since it is so,\n"+
		"Let him not die. My brother had but justice,\n"+
		"In that he did the thing for which he died:\n"+
		"For Angelo,\n"+
		"His act did not o'ertake his bad intent,\n"+
		"And must be buried but as an intent\n"+

		"Intents but merely thoughts.\n"+
		"MARIANA\n"+
		"Merely, my lord.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Your suit's unprofitable; stand up, I say.\n"+
		"I have bethought me of another fault.\n"+
		"Provost, how came it Claudio was beheaded\n"+
		"At an unusual hour?\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"It was commanded so.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"Had you a special warrant for the deed?\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"No, my good lord; it was by private message.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"For which I do discharge you of your office:\n"+
		"Give up your keys.\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"Pardon me, noble lord:\n"+
		"I thought it was a fault, but knew it not;\n"+
		"Yet did repent me, after more advice;\n"+
		"For testimony whereof, one in the prison,\n"+
		"That should by private order else have died,\n"+
		"I have reserved alive.\n"+
		"DUKE VINCENTIO\n"+
		"What's he?\n"+
		"Provost\n"+
		"His name is Barnardine.\n"+

		"I am sorry, one so learned and so wise\n"+
		"As you, Lord Angelo, have still appear'd,\n"+
		"Should slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood.\n"+
		"And lack of temper'd judgment afterward.\n"+
		"ANGELO\n"+
		"I am sorry that such sorrow I procure:\n"+
		"And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart\n"+
		"That I crave death more willingly than mercy;\n"+
		"'Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it.\n"+
