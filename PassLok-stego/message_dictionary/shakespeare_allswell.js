		"All's Well That Ends Well\n"+
		"ACT I\n"+
		"SCENE I. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.\n"+
		"Enter BERTRAM, the COUNTESS of Rousillon, HELENA, and LAFEU, all in black\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death\n"+
		"anew: but I must attend his majesty's command, to\n"+
		"whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.\n"+
		"LAFEU\n"+
		"You shall find of the king a husband, madam; you,\n"+
		"sir, a father: he that so generally is at all times\n"+
		"good must of necessity hold his virtue to you; whose\n"+
		"worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather\n"+
		"than lack it where there is such abundance.\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"What hope is there of his majesty's amendment?\n"+
		"LAFEU\n"+
		"He hath abandoned his physicians, madam; under whose\n"+
		"practises he hath persecuted time with hope, and\n"+
		"finds no other advantage in the process but only the\n"+
		"losing of hope by time.\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"This young gentlewoman had a father,--O, that\n"+
		"'had'! how sad a passage 'tis!--whose skill was\n"+
		"almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so\n"+
		"far, would have made nature immortal, and death\n"+
		"should have play for lack of work. Would, for the\n"+
		"king's sake, he were living! I think it would be\n"+
		"the death of the king's disease.\n"+
		"LAFEU\n"+
		"How called you the man you speak of, madam?\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was\n"+
		"his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.\n"+
		"LAFEU\n"+
		"He was excellent indeed, madam: the king very\n"+
		"lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly: he\n"+
		"was skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledge\n"+
		"could be set up against mortality.\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"What is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?\n"+
		"LAFEU\n"+
		"A fistula, my lord.\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"I heard not of it before.\n"+
		"LAFEU\n"+
		"I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman\n"+
		"the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my\n"+
		"overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that\n"+
		"her education promises; her dispositions she\n"+
		"inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where\n"+
		"an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there\n"+
		"commendations go with pity; they are virtues and\n"+
		"traitors too; in her they are the better for their\n"+
		"simpleness; she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.\n"+
		"LAFEU\n"+
		"Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise\n"+
		"in. The remembrance of her father never approaches\n"+
		"her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all\n"+
		"livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena;\n"+
		"go to, no more; lest it be rather thought you affect\n"+
		"a sorrow than have it.\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.\n"+
		"LAFEU\n"+
		"Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead,\n"+
		"excessive grief the enemy to the living.\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess\n"+
		"makes it soon mortal.\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"Madam, I desire your holy wishes.\n"+
		"LAFEU\n"+
		"How understand we that?\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father\n"+
		"In manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue\n"+
		"Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness\n"+
		"Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,\n"+
		"Do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy\n"+
		"Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend\n"+
		"Under thy own life's key: be cheque'd for silence,\n"+
		"But never tax'd for speech. What heaven more will,\n"+
		"That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,\n"+
		"Fall on thy head! Farewell, my lord;\n"+
		"'Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord,\n"+
		"Advise him.\n"+
		"LAFEU\n"+
		"He cannot want the best\n"+
		"That shall attend his love.\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"Heaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"[To HELENA] The best wishes that can be forged in\n"+
		"your thoughts be servants to you! Be comfortable\n"+
		"to my mother, your mistress, and make much of her.\n"+
		"LAFEU\n"+
		"Farewell, pretty lady: you must hold the credit of\n"+
		"your father.\n"+
		"Exeunt BERTRAM and LAFEU\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"O, were that all! I think not on my father;\n"+
		"And these great tears grace his remembrance more\n"+
		"Than those I shed for him. What was he like?\n"+
		"I have forgot him: my imagination\n"+
		"Carries no favour in't but Bertram's.\n"+
		"I am undone: there is no living, none,\n"+
		"If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one\n"+
		"That I should love a bright particular star\n"+
		"And think to wed it, he is so above me:\n"+
		"In his bright radiance and collateral light\n"+
		"Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.\n"+
		"The ambition in my love thus plagues itself:\n"+
		"The hind that would be mated by the lion\n"+
		"Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though plague,\n"+
		"To see him every hour; to sit and draw\n"+
		"His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,\n"+
		"In our heart's table; heart too capable\n"+
		"Of every line and trick of his sweet favour:\n"+
		"But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy\n"+
		"Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here?\n"+
		"Enter PAROLLES\n"+
		"Aside\n"+
		"One that goes with him: I love him for his sake;\n"+
		"And yet I know him a notorious liar,\n"+
		"Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;\n"+
		"Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him,\n"+
		"That they take place, when virtue's steely bones\n"+
		"Look bleak i' the cold wind: withal, full oft we see\n"+
		"Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"Save you, fair queen!\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"And you, monarch!\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"No.\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"And no.\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"Are you meditating on virginity?\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you: let me\n"+
		"ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how\n"+
		"may we barricado it against him?\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"Keep him out.\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant,\n"+
		"in the defence yet is weak: unfold to us some\n"+
		"warlike resistance.\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"There is none: man, sitting down before you, will\n"+
		"undermine you and blow you up.\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"Bless our poor virginity from underminers and\n"+
		"blowers up! Is there no military policy, how\n"+
		"virgins might blow up men?\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be\n"+
		"blown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with\n"+
		"the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It\n"+
		"is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to\n"+
		"preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational\n"+
		"increase and there was never virgin got till\n"+
		"virginity was first lost. That you were made of is\n"+
		"metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost\n"+
		"may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is\n"+
		"ever lost: 'tis too cold a companion; away with 't!\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a virgin.\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"There's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the\n"+
		"rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity,\n"+
		"is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible\n"+
		"disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin:\n"+
		"virginity murders itself and should be buried in\n"+
		"highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate\n"+
		"offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,\n"+
		"much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very\n"+
		"paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach.\n"+
		"Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of\n"+
		"self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the\n"+
		"canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but loose\n"+
		"by't: out with 't! within ten year it will make\n"+
		"itself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the\n"+
		"principal itself not much the worse: away with 't!\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"Let me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne'er it\n"+
		"likes. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with\n"+
		"lying; the longer kept, the less worth: off with 't\n"+
		"while 'tis vendible; answer the time of request.\n"+
		"Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out\n"+
		"of fashion: richly suited, but unsuitable: just\n"+
		"like the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not\n"+
		"now. Your date is better in your pie and your\n"+
		"porridge than in your cheek; and your virginity,\n"+
		"your old virginity, is like one of our French\n"+
		"withered pears, it looks ill, it eats drily; marry,\n"+
		"'tis a withered pear; it was formerly better;\n"+
		"marry, yet 'tis a withered pear: will you anything with it?\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"Not my virginity yet [ ]\n"+
		"There shall your master have a thousand loves,\n"+
		"A mother and a mistress and a friend,\n"+
		"A phoenix, captain and an enemy,\n"+
		"A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,\n"+
		"A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;\n"+
		"His humble ambition, proud humility,\n"+
		"His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,\n"+
		"His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world\n"+
		"Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms,\n"+
		"That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he--\n"+
		"I know not what he shall. God send him well!\n"+
		"The court's a learning place, and he is one--\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"What one, i' faith?\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"That I wish well. 'Tis pity--\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"What's pity?\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"That wishing well had not a body in't,\n"+
		"Which might be felt; that we, the poorer born,\n"+
		"Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,\n"+
		"Might with effects of them follow our friends,\n"+
		"And show what we alone must think, which never\n"+
		"Return us thanks.\n"+
		"Enter Page\n"+
		"Page\n"+
		"Monsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"Little Helen, farewell; if I can remember thee, I\n"+
		"will think of thee at court.\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star.\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"Under Mars, I.\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"I especially think, under Mars.\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"Why under Mars?\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"The wars have so kept you under that you must needs\n"+
		"be born under Mars.\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"When he was predominant.\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"When he was retrograde, I think, rather.\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"Why think you so?\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"You go so much backward when you fight.\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"That's for advantage.\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"So is running away, when fear proposes the safety;\n"+
		"but the composition that your valour and fear makes\n"+
		"in you is a virtue of a good wing, and I like the wear well.\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"I am so full of businesses, I cannot answer thee\n"+
		"acutely. I will return perfect courtier; in the\n"+
		"which, my instruction shall serve to naturalize\n"+
		"thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier's\n"+
		"counsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon\n"+
		"thee; else thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and\n"+
		"thine ignorance makes thee away: farewell. When\n"+
		"thou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast\n"+
		"none, remember thy friends; get thee a good husband,\n"+
		"and use him as he uses thee; so, farewell.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie,\n"+
		"Which we ascribe to heaven: the fated sky\n"+
		"Gives us free scope, only doth backward pull\n"+
		"Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull.\n"+
		"What power is it which mounts my love so high,\n"+
		"That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?\n"+
		"The mightiest space in fortune nature brings\n"+
		"To join like likes and kiss like native things.\n"+
		"Impossible be strange attempts to those\n"+
		"That weigh their pains in sense and do suppose\n"+
		"What hath been cannot be: who ever strove\n"+
		"So show her merit, that did miss her love?\n"+
		"The king's disease--my project may deceive me,\n"+
		"But my intents are fix'd and will not leave me.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE II. Paris. The KING's palace.\n"+
		"Flourish of cornets. Enter the KING of France, with letters, and divers Attendants\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"The Florentines and Senoys are by the ears;\n"+
		"Have fought with equal fortune and continue\n"+
		"A braving war.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"So 'tis reported, sir.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"Nay, 'tis most credible; we here received it\n"+
		"A certainty, vouch'd from our cousin Austria,\n"+
		"With caution that the Florentine will move us\n"+
		"For speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend\n"+
		"Prejudicates the business and would seem\n"+
		"To have us make denial.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"His love and wisdom,\n"+
		"Approved so to your majesty, may plead\n"+
		"For amplest credence.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"He hath arm'd our answer,\n"+
		"And Florence is denied before he comes:\n"+
		"Yet, for our gentlemen that mean to see\n"+
		"The Tuscan service, freely have they leave\n"+
		"To stand on either part.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"It well may serve\n"+
		"A nursery to our gentry, who are sick\n"+
		"For breathing and exploit.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"What's he comes here?\n"+
		"Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"It is the Count Rousillon, my good lord,\n"+
		"Young Bertram.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"Youth, thou bear'st thy father's face;\n"+
		"Frank nature, rather curious than in haste,\n"+
		"Hath well composed thee. Thy father's moral parts\n"+
		"Mayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"My thanks and duty are your majesty's.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"I would I had that corporal soundness now,\n"+
		"As when thy father and myself in friendship\n"+
		"First tried our soldiership! He did look far\n"+
		"Into the service of the time and was\n"+
		"Discipled of the bravest: he lasted long;\n"+
		"But on us both did haggish age steal on\n"+
		"And wore us out of act. It much repairs me\n"+
		"To talk of your good father. In his youth\n"+
		"He had the wit which I can well observe\n"+
		"To-day in our young lords; but they may jest\n"+
		"Till their own scorn return to them unnoted\n"+
		"Ere they can hide their levity in honour;\n"+
		"So like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness\n"+
		"Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were,\n"+
		"His equal had awaked them, and his honour,\n"+
		"Clock to itself, knew the true minute when\n"+
		"Exception bid him speak, and at this time\n"+
		"His tongue obey'd his hand: who were below him\n"+
		"He used as creatures of another place\n"+
		"And bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks,\n"+
		"Making them proud of his humility,\n"+
		"In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man\n"+
		"Might be a copy to these younger times;\n"+
		"Which, follow'd well, would demonstrate them now\n"+
		"But goers backward.\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"His good remembrance, sir,\n"+
		"Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;\n"+
		"So in approof lives not his epitaph\n"+
		"As in your royal speech.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"Would I were with him! He would always say--\n"+
		"Methinks I hear him now; his plausive words\n"+
		"He scatter'd not in ears, but grafted them,\n"+
		"To grow there and to bear,--'Let me not live,'--\n"+
		"This his good melancholy oft began,\n"+
		"On the catastrophe and heel of pastime,\n"+
		"When it was out,--'Let me not live,' quoth he,\n"+
		"'After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff\n"+
		"Of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses\n"+
		"All but new things disdain; whose judgments are\n"+
		"Mere fathers of their garments; whose constancies\n"+
		"Expire before their fashions.' This he wish'd;\n"+
		"I after him do after him wish too,\n"+
		"Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home,\n"+
		"I quickly were dissolved from my hive,\n"+
		"To give some labourers room.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"You are loved, sir:\n"+
		"They that least lend it you shall lack you first.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"I fill a place, I know't. How long is't, count,\n"+
		"Since the physician at your father's died?\n"+
		"He was much famed.\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"Some six months since, my lord.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"If he were living, I would try him yet.\n"+
		"Lend me an arm; the rest have worn me out\n"+
		"With several applications; nature and sickness\n"+
		"Debate it at their leisure. Welcome, count;\n"+
		"My son's no dearer.\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"Thank your majesty.\n"+
		"Exeunt. Flourish\n"+
		"SCENE III. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.\n"+
		"Enter COUNTESS, Steward, and Clown\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"I will now hear; what say you of this gentlewoman?\n"+
		"Steward\n"+
		"Madam, the care I have had to even your content, I\n"+
		"wish might be found in the calendar of my past\n"+
		"endeavours; for then we wound our modesty and make\n"+
		"foul the clearness of our deservings, when of\n"+
		"ourselves we publish them.\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"What does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah:\n"+
		"the complaints I have heard of you I do not all\n"+
		"believe: 'tis my slowness that I do not; for I know\n"+
		"you lack not folly to commit them, and have ability\n"+
		"enough to make such knaveries yours.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"'Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor fellow.\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"Well, sir.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"No, madam, 'tis not so well that I am poor, though\n"+
		"many of the rich are damned: but, if I may have\n"+
		"your ladyship's good will to go to the world, Isbel\n"+
		"the woman and I will do as we may.\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"Wilt thou needs be a beggar?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"I do beg your good will in this case.\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"In what case?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"In Isbel's case and mine own. Service is no\n"+
		"heritage: and I think I shall never have the\n"+
		"blessing of God till I have issue o' my body; for\n"+
		"they say barnes are blessings.\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"My poor body, madam, requires it: I am driven on\n"+
		"by the flesh; and he must needs go that the devil drives.\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"Is this all your worship's reason?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Faith, madam, I have other holy reasons such as they\n"+
		"are.\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"May the world know them?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"I have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and\n"+
		"all flesh and blood are; and, indeed, I do marry\n"+
		"that I may repent.\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"Thy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"I am out o' friends, madam; and I hope to have\n"+
		"friends for my wife's sake.\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"Such friends are thine enemies, knave.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"You're shallow, madam, in great friends; for the\n"+
		"knaves come to do that for me which I am aweary of.\n"+
		"He that ears my land spares my team and gives me\n"+
		"leave to in the crop; if I be his cuckold, he's my\n"+
		"drudge: he that comforts my wife is the cherisher\n"+
		"of my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh\n"+
		"and blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my\n"+
		"flesh and blood is my friend: ergo, he that kisses\n"+
		"my wife is my friend. If men could be contented to\n"+
		"be what they are, there were no fear in marriage;\n"+
		"for young Charbon the Puritan and old Poysam the\n"+
		"Papist, howsome'er their hearts are severed in\n"+
		"religion, their heads are both one; they may jowl\n"+
		"horns together, like any deer i' the herd.\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"Wilt thou ever be a foul-mouthed and calumnious knave?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"A prophet I, madam; and I speak the truth the next\n"+
		"way:\n"+
		"For I the ballad will repeat,\n"+
		"Which men full true shall find;\n"+
		"Your marriage comes by destiny,\n"+
		"Your cuckoo sings by kind.\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"Get you gone, sir; I'll talk with you more anon.\n"+
		"Steward\n"+
		"May it please you, madam, that he bid Helen come to\n"+
		"you: of her I am to speak.\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"Sirrah, tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her;\n"+
		"Helen, I mean.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Was this fair face the cause, quoth she,\n"+
		"Why the Grecians sacked Troy?\n"+
		"Fond done, done fond,\n"+
		"Was this King Priam's joy?\n"+
		"With that she sighed as she stood,\n"+
		"With that she sighed as she stood,\n"+
		"And gave this sentence then;\n"+
		"Among nine bad if one be good,\n"+
		"Among nine bad if one be good,\n"+
		"There's yet one good in ten.\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"What, one good in ten? you corrupt the song, sirrah.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"One good woman in ten, madam; which is a purifying\n"+
		"o' the song: would God would serve the world so all\n"+
		"the year! we'ld find no fault with the tithe-woman,\n"+
		"if I were the parson. One in ten, quoth a'! An we\n"+
		"might have a good woman born but one every blazing\n"+
		"star, or at an earthquake, 'twould mend the lottery\n"+
		"well: a man may draw his heart out, ere a' pluck\n"+
		"one.\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"You'll be gone, sir knave, and do as I command you.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"That man should be at woman's command, and yet no\n"+
		"hurt done! Though honesty be no puritan, yet it\n"+
		"will do no hurt; it will wear the surplice of\n"+
		"humility over the black gown of a big heart. I am\n"+
		"going, forsooth: the business is for Helen to come hither.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"Well, now.\n"+
		"Steward\n"+
		"I know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely.\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"Faith, I do: her father bequeathed her to me; and\n"+
		"she herself, without other advantage, may lawfully\n"+
		"make title to as much love as she finds: there is\n"+
		"more owing her than is paid; and more shall be paid\n"+
		"her than she'll demand.\n"+
		"Steward\n"+
		"Madam, I was very late more near her than I think\n"+
		"she wished me: alone she was, and did communicate\n"+
		"to herself her own words to her own ears; she\n"+
		"thought, I dare vow for her, they touched not any\n"+
		"stranger sense. Her matter was, she loved your son:\n"+
		"Fortune, she said, was no goddess, that had put\n"+
		"such difference betwixt their two estates; Love no\n"+
		"god, that would not extend his might, only where\n"+
		"qualities were level; Dian no queen of virgins, that\n"+
		"would suffer her poor knight surprised, without\n"+
		"rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward.\n"+
		"This she delivered in the most bitter touch of\n"+
		"sorrow that e'er I heard virgin exclaim in: which I\n"+
		"held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal;\n"+
		"sithence, in the loss that may happen, it concerns\n"+
		"you something to know it.\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"You have discharged this honestly; keep it to\n"+
		"yourself: many likelihoods informed me of this\n"+
		"before, which hung so tottering in the balance that\n"+
		"I could neither believe nor misdoubt. Pray you,\n"+

		"Exit Steward\n"+
		"Enter HELENA\n"+
		"Even so it was with me when I was young:\n"+
		"If ever we are nature's, these are ours; this thorn\n"+
		"Doth to our rose of youth rightly belong;\n"+
		"Our blood to us, this to our blood is born;\n"+
		"It is the show and seal of nature's truth,\n"+
		"Where love's strong passion is impress'd in youth:\n"+
		"By our remembrances of days foregone,\n"+
		"Such were our faults, or then we thought them none.\n"+
		"Her eye is sick on't: I observe her now.\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"What is your pleasure, madam?\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"You know, Helen,\n"+
		"I am a mother to you.\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"Mine honourable mistress.\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"Nay, a mother:\n"+
		"Why not a mother? When I said 'a mother,'\n"+
		"Methought you saw a serpent: what's in 'mother,'\n"+
		"That you start at it? I say, I am your mother;\n"+
		"And put you in the catalogue of those\n"+
		"That were enwombed mine: 'tis often seen\n"+
		"Adoption strives with nature and choice breeds\n"+
		"A native slip to us from foreign seeds:\n"+
		"You ne'er oppress'd me with a mother's groan,\n"+
		"Yet I express to you a mother's care:\n"+
		"God's mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood\n"+
		"To say I am thy mother? What's the matter,\n"+
		"That this distemper'd messenger of wet,\n"+
		"The many-colour'd Iris, rounds thine eye?\n"+
		"Why? that you are my daughter?\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"That I am not.\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"I say, I am your mother.\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"Pardon, madam;\n"+
		"The Count Rousillon cannot be my brother:\n"+
		"I am from humble, he from honour'd name;\n"+
		"No note upon my parents, his all noble:\n"+
		"My master, my dear lord he is; and I\n"+
		"His servant live, and will his vassal die:\n"+
		"He must not be my brother.\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"Nor I your mother?\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"You are my mother, madam; would you were,--\n"+
		"So that my lord your son were not my brother,--\n"+
		"Indeed my mother! or were you both our mothers,\n"+
		"I care no more for than I do for heaven,\n"+
		"So I were not his sister. Can't no other,\n"+
		"But, I your daughter, he must be my brother?\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"Yes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law:\n"+
		"God shield you mean it not! daughter and mother\n"+
		"So strive upon your pulse. What, pale again?\n"+
		"My fear hath catch'd your fondness: now I see\n"+
		"The mystery of your loneliness, and find\n"+
		"Your salt tears' head: now to all sense 'tis gross\n"+
		"You love my son; invention is ashamed,\n"+
		"Against the proclamation of thy passion,\n"+
		"To say thou dost not: therefore tell me true;\n"+
		"But tell me then, 'tis so; for, look thy cheeks\n"+
		"Confess it, th' one to th' other; and thine eyes\n"+
		"See it so grossly shown in thy behaviors\n"+
		"That in their kind they speak it: only sin\n"+
		"And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,\n"+
		"That truth should be suspected. Speak, is't so?\n"+
		"If it be so, you have wound a goodly clew;\n"+
		"If it be not, forswear't: howe'er, I charge thee,\n"+
		"As heaven shall work in me for thine avail,\n"+
		"Tell me truly.\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"Good madam, pardon me!\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"Do you love my son?\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"Your pardon, noble mistress!\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"Love you my son?\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"Do not you love him, madam?\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"Go not about; my love hath in't a bond,\n"+
		"Whereof the world takes note: come, come, disclose\n"+
		"The state of your affection; for your passions\n"+
		"Have to the full appeach'd.\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"Then, I confess,\n"+
		"Here on my knee, before high heaven and you,\n"+
		"That before you, and next unto high heaven,\n"+
		"I love your son.\n"+
		"My friends were poor, but honest; so's my love:\n"+
		"Be not offended; for it hurts not him\n"+
		"That he is loved of me: I follow him not\n"+
		"By any token of presumptuous suit;\n"+
		"Nor would I have him till I do deserve him;\n"+
		"Yet never know how that desert should be.\n"+
		"I know I love in vain, strive against hope;\n"+
		"Yet in this captious and intenible sieve\n"+
		"I still pour in the waters of my love\n"+
		"And lack not to lose still: thus, Indian-like,\n"+
		"Religious in mine error, I adore\n"+
		"The sun, that looks upon his worshipper,\n"+
		"But knows of him no more. My dearest madam,\n"+
		"Let not your hate encounter with my love\n"+
		"For loving where you do: but if yourself,\n"+
		"Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth,\n"+
		"Did ever in so true a flame of liking\n"+
		"Wish chastely and love dearly, that your Dian\n"+
		"Was both herself and love: O, then, give pity\n"+
		"To her, whose state is such that cannot choose\n"+
		"But lend and give where she is sure to lose;\n"+
		"That seeks not to find that her search implies,\n"+
		"But riddle-like lives sweetly where she dies!\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"Had you not lately an intent,--speak truly,--\n"+
		"To go to Paris?\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"Madam, I had.\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"Wherefore? tell true.\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"I will tell truth; by grace itself I swear.\n"+
		"You know my father left me some prescriptions\n"+
		"Of rare and proved effects, such as his reading\n"+
		"And manifest experience had collected\n"+
		"For general sovereignty; and that he will'd me\n"+
		"In heedfull'st reservation to bestow them,\n"+
		"As notes whose faculties inclusive were\n"+
		"More than they were in note: amongst the rest,\n"+
		"There is a remedy, approved, set down,\n"+
		"To cure the desperate languishings whereof\n"+
		"The king is render'd lost.\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"This was your motive\n"+
		"For Paris, was it? speak.\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"My lord your son made me to think of this;\n"+
		"Else Paris and the medicine and the king\n"+
		"Had from the conversation of my thoughts\n"+
		"Haply been absent then.\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"But think you, Helen,\n"+
		"If you should tender your supposed aid,\n"+
		"He would receive it? he and his physicians\n"+
		"Are of a mind; he, that they cannot help him,\n"+
		"They, that they cannot help: how shall they credit\n"+
		"A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,\n"+
		"Embowell'd of their doctrine, have left off\n"+
		"The danger to itself?\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"There's something in't,\n"+
		"More than my father's skill, which was the greatest\n"+
		"Of his profession, that his good receipt\n"+
		"Shall for my legacy be sanctified\n"+
		"By the luckiest stars in heaven: and, would your honour\n"+
		"But give me leave to try success, I'ld venture\n"+
		"The well-lost life of mine on his grace's cure\n"+
		"By such a day and hour.\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"Dost thou believe't?\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"Ay, madam, knowingly.\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"Why, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love,\n"+
		"Means and attendants and my loving greetings\n"+
		"To those of mine in court: I'll stay at home\n"+
		"And pray God's blessing into thy attempt:\n"+
		"Be gone to-morrow; and be sure of this,\n"+
		"What I can help thee to thou shalt not miss.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT II\n"+
		"SCENE I. Paris. The KING's palace.\n"+
		"Flourish of cornets. Enter the KING, attended with divers young Lords taking leave for the Florentine war; BERTRAM, and PAROLLES\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"Farewell, young lords; these warlike principles\n"+
		"Do not throw from you: and you, my lords, farewell:\n"+
		"Share the advice betwixt you; if both gain, all\n"+
		"The gift doth stretch itself as 'tis received,\n"+
		"And is enough for both.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"'Tis our hope, sir,\n"+
		"After well enter'd soldiers, to return\n"+
		"And find your grace in health.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"No, no, it cannot be; and yet my heart\n"+
		"Will not confess he owes the malady\n"+
		"That doth my life besiege. Farewell, young lords;\n"+
		"Whether I live or die, be you the sons\n"+
		"Of worthy Frenchmen: let higher Italy,--\n"+
		"Those bated that inherit but the fall\n"+
		"Of the last monarchy,--see that you come\n"+
		"Not to woo honour, but to wed it; when\n"+
		"The bravest questant shrinks, find what you seek,\n"+
		"That fame may cry you loud: I say, farewell.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"Health, at your bidding, serve your majesty!\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"Those girls of Italy, take heed of them:\n"+
		"They say, our French lack language to deny,\n"+
		"If they demand: beware of being captives,\n"+
		"Before you serve.\n"+
		"Both\n"+
		"Our hearts receive your warnings.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"Farewell. Come hither to me.\n"+
		"Exit, attended\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"O, my sweet lord, that you will stay behind us!\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"'Tis not his fault, the spark.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"O, 'tis brave wars!\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"Most admirable: I have seen those wars.\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"I am commanded here, and kept a coil with\n"+
		"'Too young' and 'the next year' and ''tis too early.'\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"An thy mind stand to't, boy, steal away bravely.\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"I shall stay here the forehorse to a smock,\n"+
		"Creaking my shoes on the plain masonry,\n"+
		"Till honour be bought up and no sword worn\n"+
		"But one to dance with! By heaven, I'll steal away.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"There's honour in the theft.\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"Commit it, count.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"I am your accessary; and so, farewell.\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"I grow to you, and our parting is a tortured body.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"Farewell, captain.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"Sweet Monsieur Parolles!\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"Noble heroes, my sword and yours are kin. Good\n"+
		"sparks and lustrous, a word, good metals: you shall\n"+
		"find in the regiment of the Spinii one Captain\n"+
		"Spurio, with his cicatrice, an emblem of war, here\n"+
		"on his sinister cheek; it was this very sword\n"+
		"entrenched it: say to him, I live; and observe his\n"+
		"reports for me.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"We shall, noble captain.\n"+
		"Exeunt Lords\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"Mars dote on you for his novices! what will ye do?\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"Stay: the king.\n"+
		"Re-enter KING. BERTRAM and PAROLLES retire\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"[To BERTRAM] Use a more spacious ceremony to the\n"+
		"noble lords; you have restrained yourself within the\n"+
		"list of too cold an adieu: be more expressive to\n"+
		"them: for they wear themselves in the cap of the\n"+
		"time, there do muster true gait, eat, speak, and\n"+
		"move under the influence of the most received star;\n"+
		"and though the devil lead the measure, such are to\n"+
		"be followed: after them, and take a more dilated farewell.\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"And I will do so.\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"Worthy fellows; and like to prove most sinewy sword-men.\n"+
		"Exeunt BERTRAM and PAROLLES\n"+
		"Enter LAFEU\n"+
		"LAFEU\n"+
		"[Kneeling] Pardon, my lord, for me and for my tidings.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"I'll fee thee to stand up.\n"+
		"LAFEU\n"+
		"Then here's a man stands, that has brought his pardon.\n"+
		"I would you had kneel'd, my lord, to ask me mercy,\n"+
		"And that at my bidding you could so stand up.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"I would I had; so I had broke thy pate,\n"+
		"And ask'd thee mercy for't.\n"+
		"LAFEU\n"+
		"Good faith, across: but, my good lord 'tis thus;\n"+
		"Will you be cured of your infirmity?\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"No.\n"+
		"LAFEU\n"+
		"O, will you eat no grapes, my royal fox?\n"+
		"Yes, but you will my noble grapes, an if\n"+
		"My royal fox could reach them: I have seen a medicine\n"+
		"That's able to breathe life into a stone,\n"+
		"Quicken a rock, and make you dance canary\n"+
		"With spritely fire and motion; whose simple touch,\n"+
		"Is powerful to araise King Pepin, nay,\n"+
		"To give great Charlemain a pen in's hand,\n"+
		"And write to her a love-line.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"What 'her' is this?\n"+
		"LAFEU\n"+
		"Why, Doctor She: my lord, there's one arrived,\n"+
		"If you will see her: now, by my faith and honour,\n"+
		"If seriously I may convey my thoughts\n"+
		"In this my light deliverance, I have spoke\n"+
		"With one that, in her sex, her years, profession,\n"+
		"Wisdom and constancy, hath amazed me more\n"+
		"Than I dare blame my weakness: will you see her\n"+
		"For that is her demand, and know her business?\n"+
		"That done, laugh well at me.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"Now, good Lafeu,\n"+
		"Bring in the admiration; that we with thee\n"+
		"May spend our wonder too, or take off thine\n"+
		"By wondering how thou took'st it.\n"+
		"LAFEU\n"+
		"Nay, I'll fit you,\n"+
		"And not be all day neither.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"Thus he his special nothing ever prologues.\n"+
		"Re-enter LAFEU, with HELENA\n"+
		"LAFEU\n"+
		"Nay, come your ways.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"This haste hath wings indeed.\n"+
		"LAFEU\n"+
		"Nay, come your ways:\n"+
		"This is his majesty; say your mind to him:\n"+
		"A traitor you do look like; but such traitors\n"+
		"His majesty seldom fears: I am Cressid's uncle,\n"+
		"That dare leave two together; fare you well.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"Now, fair one, does your business follow us?\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"Ay, my good lord.\n"+
		"Gerard de Narbon was my father;\n"+
		"In what he did profess, well found.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"I knew him.\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"The rather will I spare my praises towards him:\n"+
		"Knowing him is enough. On's bed of death\n"+
		"Many receipts he gave me: chiefly one.\n"+
		"Which, as the dearest issue of his practise,\n"+
		"And of his old experience the oily darling,\n"+
		"He bade me store up, as a triple eye,\n"+
		"Safer than mine own two, more dear; I have so;\n"+
		"And hearing your high majesty is touch'd\n"+
		"With that malignant cause wherein the honour\n"+
		"Of my dear father's gift stands chief in power,\n"+
		"I come to tender it and my appliance\n"+
		"With all bound humbleness.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"We thank you, maiden;\n"+
		"But may not be so credulous of cure,\n"+
		"When our most learned doctors leave us and\n"+
		"The congregated college have concluded\n"+
		"That labouring art can never ransom nature\n"+
		"From her inaidible estate; I say we must not\n"+
		"So stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope,\n"+
		"To prostitute our past-cure malady\n"+
		"To empirics, or to dissever so\n"+
		"Our great self and our credit, to esteem\n"+
		"A senseless help when help past sense we deem.\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"My duty then shall pay me for my pains:\n"+
		"I will no more enforce mine office on you.\n"+
		"Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts\n"+
		"A modest one, to bear me back again.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"I cannot give thee less, to be call'd grateful:\n"+
		"Thou thought'st to help me; and such thanks I give\n"+
		"As one near death to those that wish him live:\n"+
		"But what at full I know, thou know'st no part,\n"+
		"I knowing all my peril, thou no art.\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"What I can do can do no hurt to try,\n"+
		"Since you set up your rest 'gainst remedy.\n"+
		"He that of greatest works is finisher\n"+
		"Oft does them by the weakest minister:\n"+
		"So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown,\n"+
		"When judges have been babes; great floods have flown\n"+
		"From simple sources, and great seas have dried\n"+
		"When miracles have by the greatest been denied.\n"+
		"Oft expectation fails and most oft there\n"+
		"Where most it promises, and oft it hits\n"+
		"Where hope is coldest and despair most fits.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"I must not hear thee; fare thee well, kind maid;\n"+
		"Thy pains not used must by thyself be paid:\n"+
		"Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward.\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"Inspired merit so by breath is barr'd:\n"+
		"It is not so with Him that all things knows\n"+
		"As 'tis with us that square our guess by shows;\n"+
		"But most it is presumption in us when\n"+
		"The help of heaven we count the act of men.\n"+
		"Dear sir, to my endeavours give consent;\n"+
		"Of heaven, not me, make an experiment.\n"+
		"I am not an impostor that proclaim\n"+
		"Myself against the level of mine aim;\n"+
		"But know I think and think I know most sure\n"+
		"My art is not past power nor you past cure.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"Are thou so confident? within what space\n"+
		"Hopest thou my cure?\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"The great'st grace lending grace\n"+
		"Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring\n"+
		"Their fiery torcher his diurnal ring,\n"+
		"Ere twice in murk and occidental damp\n"+
		"Moist Hesperus hath quench'd his sleepy lamp,\n"+
		"Or four and twenty times the pilot's glass\n"+
		"Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass,\n"+
		"What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly,\n"+
		"Health shall live free and sickness freely die.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"Upon thy certainty and confidence\n"+
		"What darest thou venture?\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"Tax of impudence,\n"+
		"A strumpet's boldness, a divulged shame\n"+
		"Traduced by odious ballads: my maiden's name\n"+
		"Sear'd otherwise; nay, worse--if worse--extended\n"+
		"With vilest torture let my life be ended.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak\n"+
		"His powerful sound within an organ weak:\n"+
		"And what impossibility would slay\n"+
		"In common sense, sense saves another way.\n"+
		"Thy life is dear; for all that life can rate\n"+
		"Worth name of life in thee hath estimate,\n"+
		"Youth, beauty, wisdom, courage, all\n"+
		"That happiness and prime can happy call:\n"+
		"Thou this to hazard needs must intimate\n"+
		"Skill infinite or monstrous desperate.\n"+
		"Sweet practiser, thy physic I will try,\n"+
		"That ministers thine own death if I die.\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"If I break time, or flinch in property\n"+
		"Of what I spoke, unpitied let me die,\n"+
		"And well deserved: not helping, death's my fee;\n"+
		"But, if I help, what do you promise me?\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"Make thy demand.\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"But will you make it even?\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"Ay, by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven.\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand\n"+
		"What husband in thy power I will command:\n"+
		"Exempted be from me the arrogance\n"+
		"To choose from forth the royal blood of France,\n"+
		"My low and humble name to propagate\n"+
		"With any branch or image of thy state;\n"+
		"But such a one, thy vassal, whom I know\n"+
		"Is free for me to ask, thee to bestow.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"Here is my hand; the premises observed,\n"+
		"Thy will by my performance shall be served:\n"+
		"So make the choice of thy own time, for I,\n"+
		"Thy resolved patient, on thee still rely.\n"+
		"More should I question thee, and more I must,\n"+
		"Though more to know could not be more to trust,\n"+
		"From whence thou camest, how tended on: but rest\n"+
		"Unquestion'd welcome and undoubted blest.\n"+
		"Give me some help here, ho! If thou proceed\n"+
		"As high as word, my deed shall match thy meed.\n"+
		"Flourish. Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.\n"+
		"Enter COUNTESS and Clown\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"Come on, sir; I shall now put you to the height of\n"+
		"your breeding.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught: I\n"+
		"know my business is but to the court.\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"To the court! why, what place make you special,\n"+
		"when you put off that with such contempt? But to the court!\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners, he\n"+
		"may easily put it off at court: he that cannot make\n"+
		"a leg, put off's cap, kiss his hand and say nothing,\n"+
		"has neither leg, hands, lip, nor cap; and indeed\n"+
		"such a fellow, to say precisely, were not for the\n"+
		"court; but for me, I have an answer will serve all\n"+
		"men.\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"Marry, that's a bountiful answer that fits all\n"+
		"questions.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"It is like a barber's chair that fits all buttocks,\n"+
		"the pin-buttock, the quatch-buttock, the brawn\n"+
		"buttock, or any buttock.\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"Will your answer serve fit to all questions?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney,\n"+
		"as your French crown for your taffeta punk, as Tib's\n"+
		"rush for Tom's forefinger, as a pancake for Shrove\n"+
		"Tuesday, a morris for May-day, as the nail to his\n"+
		"hole, the cuckold to his horn, as a scolding queen\n"+
		"to a wrangling knave, as the nun's lip to the\n"+
		"friar's mouth, nay, as the pudding to his skin.\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"Have you, I say, an answer of such fitness for all\n"+
		"questions?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"From below your duke to beneath your constable, it\n"+
		"will fit any question.\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"It must be an answer of most monstrous size that\n"+
		"must fit all demands.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"But a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learned\n"+
		"should speak truth of it: here it is, and all that\n"+
		"belongs to't. Ask me if I am a courtier: it shall\n"+
		"do you no harm to learn.\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"To be young again, if we could: I will be a fool in\n"+
		"question, hoping to be the wiser by your answer. I\n"+
		"pray you, sir, are you a courtier?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"O Lord, sir! There's a simple putting off. More,\n"+
		"more, a hundred of them.\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"Sir, I am a poor friend of yours, that loves you.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"O Lord, sir! Thick, thick, spare not me.\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"I think, sir, you can eat none of this homely meat.\n"+

		"LAFEU\n"+
		"They say miracles are past; and we have our\n"+
		"philosophical persons, to make modern and familiar,\n"+
		"things supernatural and causeless. Hence is it that\n"+
		"we make trifles of terrors, ensconcing ourselves\n"+
		"into seeming knowledge, when we should submit\n"+
		"ourselves to an unknown fear.\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"Why, 'tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath\n"+

		"BERTRAM\n"+

		"LAFEU\n"+
		"Uncertain life, and sure death.\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"Just, you say well; so would I have said.\n"+
		"LAFEU\n"+
		"I may truly say, it is a novelty to the world.\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"It is, indeed: if you will have it in showing, you\n"+
		"shall read it in--what do you call there?\n"+
		"LAFEU\n"+
		"A showing of a heavenly effect in an earthly actor.\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"That's it; I would have said the very same.\n"+

		"Why, your dolphin is not lustier: 'fore me,\n"+
		"I speak in respect--\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"Nay, 'tis strange, 'tis very strange, that is the\n"+

		"LAFEU\n"+
		"These boys are boys of ice, they'll none have her:\n"+

		"HELENA\n"+
		"You are too young, too happy, and too good,\n"+
		"To make yourself a son out of my blood.\n"+
		"Fourth Lord\n"+
		"Fair one, I think not so.\n"+
		"LAFEU\n"+
		"There's one grape yet; I am sure thy father drunk\n"+
		"wine: but if thou be'st not an ass, I am a youth\n"+
		"of fourteen; I have known thee already.\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"[To BERTRAM] I dare not say I take you; but I give\n"+

		"KING\n"+
		"Why, then, young Bertram, take her; she's thy wife.\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"My wife, my liege! I shall beseech your highness,\n"+
		"In such a business give me leave to use\n"+

		"KING\n"+
		"Know'st thou not, Bertram,\n"+
		"What she has done for me?\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"Yes, my good lord;\n"+
		"But never hope to know why I should marry her.\n"+

		"Thou know'st she has raised me from my sickly bed.\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"But follows it, my lord, to bring me down\n"+
		"Must answer for your raising? I know her well:\n"+
		"She had her breeding at my father's charge.\n"+
		"A poor physician's daughter my wife! Disdain\n"+
		"Rather corrupt me ever!\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"'Tis only title thou disdain'st in her, the which\n"+
		"I can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,\n"+
		"Of colour, weight, and heat, pour'd all together,\n"+
		"Would quite confound distinction, yet stand off\n"+
		"In differences so mighty. If she be\n"+
		"All that is virtuous, save what thou dislikest,\n"+
		"A poor physician's daughter, thou dislikest\n"+
		"Of virtue for the name: but do not so:\n"+
		"From lowest place when virtuous things proceed,\n"+
		"The place is dignified by the doer's deed:\n"+
		"Where great additions swell's, and virtue none,\n"+
		"It is a dropsied honour. Good alone\n"+
		"Is good without a name. Vileness is so:\n"+
		"The property by what it is should go,\n"+
		"Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair;\n"+
		"In these to nature she's immediate heir,\n"+
		"And these breed honour: that is honour's scorn,\n"+
		"Which challenges itself as honour's born\n"+
		"And is not like the sire: honours thrive,\n"+
		"When rather from our acts we them derive\n"+
		"Than our foregoers: the mere word's a slave\n"+
		"Debosh'd on every tomb, on every grave\n"+
		"A lying trophy, and as oft is dumb\n"+
		"Where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb\n"+
		"Of honour'd bones indeed. What should be said?\n"+
		"If thou canst like this creature as a maid,\n"+
		"I can create the rest: virtue and she\n"+

		"KING\n"+
		"My honour's at the stake; which to defeat,\n"+
		"I must produce my power. Here, take her hand,\n"+
		"Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift;\n"+
		"That dost in vile misprision shackle up\n"+
		"My love and her desert; that canst not dream,\n"+
		"We, poising us in her defective scale,\n"+

		"Into the staggers and the careless lapse\n"+
		"Of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate\n"+
		"Loosing upon thee, in the name of justice,\n"+
		"Without all terms of pity. Speak; thine answer.\n"+

		"What great creation and what dole of honour\n"+
		"Flies where you bid it, I find that she, which late\n"+
		"Was in my nobler thoughts most base, is now\n"+
		"The praised of the king; who, so ennobled,\n"+
		"Is as 'twere born so.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"Take her by the hand,\n"+
		"And tell her she is thine: to whom I promise\n"+
		"A counterpoise, if not to thy estate\n"+
		"A balance more replete.\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"I take her hand.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"Good fortune and the favour of the king\n"+
		"Smile upon this contract; whose ceremony\n"+
		"Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief,\n"+
		"And be perform'd to-night: the solemn feast\n"+

		"A good traveller is something at the latter end of a\n"+

		"Second Lord\n"+
		"Good my lord,\n"+
		"The reasons of our state I cannot yield,\n"+

		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"By what observance, I pray you?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Why, he will look upon his boot and sing; mend the\n"+
		"ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his\n"+

		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"Why should he be killed?\n"+

		"Second Gentleman\n"+
		"Madam, he's gone to serve the duke of Florence:\n"+
		"We met him thitherward; for thence we came,\n"+
		"And, after some dispatch in hand at court,\n"+

		"When thou canst get the ring upon my finger which\n"+

		"This is a dreadful sentence.\n"+

		"Brought you this letter, gentlemen?\n"+
		"First Gentleman\n"+
		"Ay, madam;\n"+

		"Ay, madam.\n"+

		"Such is his noble purpose; and believe 't,\n"+

		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE V. Florence. Without the walls. A tucket afar off.\n"+
		"Enter an old Widow of Florence, DIANA, VIOLENTA, and MARIANA, with other Citizens\n"+
		"Widow\n"+
		"Nay, come; for if they do approach the city, we\n"+
		"shall lose all the sight.\n"+
		"DIANA\n"+
		"They say the French count has done most honourable service.\n"+
		"Widow\n"+
		"It is reported that he has taken their greatest\n"+

		"way: hark! you may know by their trumpets.\n"+
		"MARIANA\n"+
		"Come, let's return again, and suffice ourselves with\n"+
		"the report of it. Well, Diana, take heed of this\n"+
		"French earl: the honour of a maid is her name; and\n"+
		"no legacy is so rich as honesty.\n"+
		"Widow\n"+
		"I have told my neighbour how you have been solicited\n"+
		"by a gentleman his companion.\n"+
		"MARIANA\n"+
		"I know that knave; hang him! one Parolles: a\n"+
		"filthy officer he is in those suggestions for the\n"+
		"young earl. Beware of them, Diana; their promises,\n"+
		"enticements, oaths, tokens, and all these engines of\n"+
		"lust, are not the things they go under: many a maid\n"+
		"hath been seduced by them; and the misery is,\n"+
		"example, that so terrible shows in the wreck of\n"+
		"maidenhood, cannot for all that dissuade succession,\n"+
		"but that they are limed with the twigs that threaten\n"+
		"them. I hope I need not to advise you further; but\n"+
		"I hope your own grace will keep you where you are,\n"+
		"though there were no further danger known but the\n"+
		"modesty which is so lost.\n"+
		"DIANA\n"+
		"You shall not need to fear me.\n"+
		"Widow\n"+
		"I hope so.\n"+
		"Enter HELENA, disguised like a Pilgrim\n"+
		"Look, here comes a pilgrim: I know she will lie at\n"+
		"my house; thither they send one another: I'll\n"+
		"question her. God save you, pilgrim! whither are you bound?\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"To Saint Jaques le Grand.\n"+
		"Where do the palmers lodge, I do beseech you?\n"+
		"Widow\n"+
		"At the Saint Francis here beside the port.\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"Is this the way?\n"+
		"Widow\n"+
		"Ay, marry, is't.\n"+
		"A march afar\n"+
		"Hark you! they come this way.\n"+
		"If you will tarry, holy pilgrim,\n"+
		"But till the troops come by,\n"+
		"I will conduct you where you shall be lodged;\n"+
		"The rather, for I think I know your hostess\n"+
		"As ample as myself.\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"Is it yourself?\n"+
		"Widow\n"+
		"If you shall please so, pilgrim.\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"I thank you, and will stay upon your leisure.\n"+
		"Widow\n"+
		"You came, I think, from France?\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"I did so.\n"+
		"Widow\n"+
		"Here you shall see a countryman of yours\n"+
		"That has done worthy service.\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"His name, I pray you.\n"+
		"DIANA\n"+
		"The Count Rousillon: know you such a one?\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"But by the ear, that hears most nobly of him:\n"+
		"His face I know not.\n"+
		"DIANA\n"+
		"Whatsome'er he is,\n"+
		"He's bravely taken here. He stole from France,\n"+
		"As 'tis reported, for the king had married him\n"+
		"Against his liking: think you it is so?\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"Ay, surely, mere the truth: I know his lady.\n"+
		"DIANA\n"+
		"There is a gentleman that serves the count\n"+
		"Reports but coarsely of her.\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"What's his name?\n"+
		"DIANA\n"+
		"Monsieur Parolles.\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"O, I believe with him,\n"+
		"In argument of praise, or to the worth\n"+
		"Of the great count himself, she is too mean\n"+
		"To have her name repeated: all her deserving\n"+
		"Is a reserved honesty, and that\n"+
		"I have not heard examined.\n"+
		"DIANA\n"+
		"Alas, poor lady!\n"+
		"'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife\n"+
		"Of a detesting lord.\n"+
		"Widow\n"+
		"I warrant, good creature, wheresoe'er she is,\n"+
		"Her heart weighs sadly: this young maid might do her\n"+
		"A shrewd turn, if she pleased.\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"How do you mean?\n"+
		"May be the amorous count solicits her\n"+
		"In the unlawful purpose.\n"+
		"Widow\n"+
		"He does indeed;\n"+
		"And brokes with all that can in such a suit\n"+
		"Corrupt the tender honour of a maid:\n"+
		"But she is arm'd for him and keeps her guard\n"+
		"In honestest defence.\n"+
		"MARIANA\n"+
		"The gods forbid else!\n"+
		"Widow\n"+
		"So, now they come:\n"+
		"Drum and Colours\n"+
		"Enter BERTRAM, PAROLLES, and the whole army\n"+
		"That is Antonio, the duke's eldest son;\n"+
		"That, Escalus.\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"Which is the Frenchman?\n"+
		"DIANA\n"+
		"He;\n"+
		"That with the plume: 'tis a most gallant fellow.\n"+
		"I would he loved his wife: if he were honester\n"+
		"He were much goodlier: is't not a handsome gentleman?\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"I like him well.\n"+
		"DIANA\n"+
		"'Tis pity he is not honest: yond's that same knave\n"+
		"That leads him to these places: were I his lady,\n"+
		"I would Poison that vile rascal.\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"Which is he?\n"+
		"DIANA\n"+
		"That jack-an-apes with scarfs: why is he melancholy?\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"Perchance he's hurt i' the battle.\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"Lose our drum! well.\n"+
		"MARIANA\n"+
		"He's shrewdly vexed at something: look, he has spied us.\n"+
		"Widow\n"+
		"Marry, hang you!\n"+
		"MARIANA\n"+
		"And your courtesy, for a ring-carrier!\n"+
		"Exeunt BERTRAM, PAROLLES, and army\n"+
		"Widow\n"+
		"The troop is past. Come, pilgrim, I will bring you\n"+
		"Where you shall host: of enjoin'd penitents\n"+
		"There's four or five, to great Saint Jaques bound,\n"+
		"Already at my house.\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"I humbly thank you:\n"+
		"Please it this matron and this gentle maid\n"+
		"To eat with us to-night, the charge and thanking\n"+
		"Shall be for me; and, to requite you further,\n"+
		"I will bestow some precepts of this virgin\n"+
		"Worthy the note.\n"+
		"BOTH\n"+
		"We'll take your offer kindly.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE VI. Camp before Florence.\n"+
		"Enter BERTRAM and the two French Lords\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"Nay, good my lord, put him to't; let him have his\n"+
		"way.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"If your lordship find him not a hilding, hold me no\n"+
		"more in your respect.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"On my life, my lord, a bubble.\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"Do you think I am so far deceived in him?\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge,\n"+
		"without any malice, but to speak of him as my\n"+
		"kinsman, he's a most notable coward, an infinite and\n"+
		"endless liar, an hourly promise-breaker, the owner\n"+
		"of no one good quality worthy your lordship's\n"+
		"entertainment.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"It were fit you knew him; lest, reposing too far in\n"+
		"his virtue, which he hath not, he might at some\n"+
		"great and trusty business in a main danger fail you.\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"I would I knew in what particular action to try him.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"None better than to let him fetch off his drum,\n"+
		"which you hear him so confidently undertake to do.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"I, with a troop of Florentines, will suddenly\n"+
		"surprise him; such I will have, whom I am sure he\n"+
		"knows not from the enemy: we will bind and hoodwink\n"+
		"him so, that he shall suppose no other but that he\n"+
		"is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries, when\n"+
		"we bring him to our own tents. Be but your lordship\n"+
		"present at his examination: if he do not, for the\n"+
		"promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of\n"+
		"base fear, offer to betray you and deliver all the\n"+
		"intelligence in his power against you, and that with\n"+
		"the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath, never\n"+
		"trust my judgment in any thing.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"O, for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum;\n"+
		"he says he has a stratagem for't: when your\n"+
		"lordship sees the bottom of his success in't, and to\n"+
		"what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be\n"+
		"melted, if you give him not John Drum's\n"+
		"entertainment, your inclining cannot be removed.\n"+
		"Here he comes.\n"+
		"Enter PAROLLES\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"[Aside to BERTRAM] O, for the love of laughter,\n"+
		"hinder not the honour of his design: let him fetch\n"+
		"off his drum in any hand.\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"How now, monsieur! this drum sticks sorely in your\n"+
		"disposition.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"A pox on't, let it go; 'tis but a drum.\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"'But a drum'! is't 'but a drum'? A drum so lost!\n"+
		"There was excellent command,--to charge in with our\n"+
		"horse upon our own wings, and to rend our own soldiers!\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"That was not to be blamed in the command of the\n"+
		"service: it was a disaster of war that Caesar\n"+
		"himself could not have prevented, if he had been\n"+
		"there to command.\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success: some\n"+
		"dishonour we had in the loss of that drum; but it is\n"+
		"not to be recovered.\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"It might have been recovered.\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"It might; but it is not now.\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"It is to be recovered: but that the merit of\n"+
		"service is seldom attributed to the true and exact\n"+
		"performer, I would have that drum or another, or\n"+
		"'hic jacet.'\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"Why, if you have a stomach, to't, monsieur: if you\n"+
		"think your mystery in stratagem can bring this\n"+
		"instrument of honour again into his native quarter,\n"+
		"be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on; I will\n"+
		"grace the attempt for a worthy exploit: if you\n"+
		"speed well in it, the duke shall both speak of it.\n"+
		"and extend to you what further becomes his\n"+
		"greatness, even to the utmost syllable of your\n"+
		"worthiness.\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"By the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it.\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"But you must not now slumber in it.\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"I'll about it this evening: and I will presently\n"+
		"pen down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my\n"+
		"certainty, put myself into my mortal preparation;\n"+
		"and by midnight look to hear further from me.\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"May I be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it?\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"I know not what the success will be, my lord; but\n"+
		"the attempt I vow.\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"I know thou'rt valiant; and, to the possibility of\n"+
		"thy soldiership, will subscribe for thee. Farewell.\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"I love not many words.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"No more than a fish loves water. Is not this a\n"+
		"strange fellow, my lord, that so confidently seems\n"+
		"to undertake this business, which he knows is not to\n"+
		"be done; damns himself to do and dares better be\n"+
		"damned than to do't?\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"You do not know him, my lord, as we do: certain it\n"+
		"is that he will steal himself into a man's favour and\n"+
		"for a week escape a great deal of discoveries; but\n"+
		"when you find him out, you have him ever after.\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"Why, do you think he will make no deed at all of\n"+
		"this that so seriously he does address himself unto?\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"None in the world; but return with an invention and\n"+
		"clap upon you two or three probable lies: but we\n"+
		"have almost embossed him; you shall see his fall\n"+
		"to-night; for indeed he is not for your lordship's respect.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"We'll make you some sport with the fox ere we case\n"+
		"him. He was first smoked by the old lord Lafeu:\n"+
		"when his disguise and he is parted, tell me what a\n"+
		"sprat you shall find him; which you shall see this\n"+
		"very night.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"I must go look my twigs: he shall be caught.\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"Your brother he shall go along with me.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"As't please your lordship: I'll leave you.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"Now will I lead you to the house, and show you\n"+
		"The lass I spoke of.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"But you say she's honest.\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"That's all the fault: I spoke with her but once\n"+
		"And found her wondrous cold; but I sent to her,\n"+
		"By this same coxcomb that we have i' the wind,\n"+
		"Tokens and letters which she did re-send;\n"+
		"And this is all I have done. She's a fair creature:\n"+
		"Will you go see her?\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"With all my heart, my lord.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE VII. Florence. The Widow's house.\n"+
		"Enter HELENA and Widow\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"If you misdoubt me that I am not she,\n"+
		"I know not how I shall assure you further,\n"+
		"But I shall lose the grounds I work upon.\n"+
		"Widow\n"+
		"Though my estate be fallen, I was well born,\n"+
		"Nothing acquainted with these businesses;\n"+
		"And would not put my reputation now\n"+
		"In any staining act.\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"Nor would I wish you.\n"+
		"First, give me trust, the count he is my husband,\n"+
		"And what to your sworn counsel I have spoken\n"+
		"Is so from word to word; and then you cannot,\n"+
		"By the good aid that I of you shall borrow,\n"+
		"Err in bestowing it.\n"+
		"Widow\n"+
		"I should believe you:\n"+
		"For you have show'd me that which well approves\n"+
		"You're great in fortune.\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"Take this purse of gold,\n"+
		"And let me buy your friendly help thus far,\n"+
		"Which I will over-pay and pay again\n"+
		"When I have found it. The count he wooes your daughter,\n"+
		"Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty,\n"+
		"Resolved to carry her: let her in fine consent,\n"+
		"As we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it.\n"+
		"Now his important blood will nought deny\n"+
		"That she'll demand: a ring the county wears,\n"+
		"That downward hath succeeded in his house\n"+
		"From son to son, some four or five descents\n"+
		"Since the first father wore it: this ring he holds\n"+
		"In most rich choice; yet in his idle fire,\n"+
		"To buy his will, it would not seem too dear,\n"+
		"Howe'er repented after.\n"+
		"Widow\n"+
		"Now I see\n"+
		"The bottom of your purpose.\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"You see it lawful, then: it is no more,\n"+
		"But that your daughter, ere she seems as won,\n"+
		"Desires this ring; appoints him an encounter;\n"+
		"In fine, delivers me to fill the time,\n"+
		"Herself most chastely absent: after this,\n"+
		"To marry her, I'll add three thousand crowns\n"+
		"To what is passed already.\n"+
		"Widow\n"+
		"I have yielded:\n"+
		"Instruct my daughter how she shall persever,\n"+
		"That time and place with this deceit so lawful\n"+
		"May prove coherent. Every night he comes\n"+
		"With musics of all sorts and songs composed\n"+
		"To her unworthiness: it nothing steads us\n"+
		"To chide him from our eaves; for he persists\n"+
		"As if his life lay on't.\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"Why then to-night\n"+
		"Let us assay our plot; which, if it speed,\n"+
		"Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed\n"+
		"And lawful meaning in a lawful act,\n"+
		"Where both not sin, and yet a sinful fact:\n"+
		"But let's about it.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"ACT IV\n"+
		"SCENE I. Without the Florentine camp.\n"+
		"Enter Second French Lord, with five or six other Soldiers in ambush\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"He can come no other way but by this hedge-corner.\n"+
		"When you sally upon him, speak what terrible\n"+
		"language you will: though you understand it not\n"+
		"yourselves, no matter; for we must not seem to\n"+
		"understand him, unless some one among us whom we\n"+
		"must produce for an interpreter.\n"+
		"First Soldier\n"+
		"Good captain, let me be the interpreter.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"Art not acquainted with him? knows he not thy voice?\n"+
		"First Soldier\n"+
		"No, sir, I warrant you.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"But what linsey-woolsey hast thou to speak to us again?\n"+
		"First Soldier\n"+
		"E'en such as you speak to me.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"He must think us some band of strangers i' the\n"+
		"adversary's entertainment. Now he hath a smack of\n"+
		"all neighbouring languages; therefore we must every\n"+
		"one be a man of his own fancy, not to know what we\n"+
		"speak one to another; so we seem to know, is to\n"+
		"know straight our purpose: choughs' language,\n"+
		"gabble enough, and good enough. As for you,\n"+
		"interpreter, you must seem very politic. But couch,\n"+
		"ho! here he comes, to beguile two hours in a sleep,\n"+
		"and then to return and swear the lies he forges.\n"+
		"Enter PAROLLES\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"Ten o'clock: within these three hours 'twill be\n"+
		"time enough to go home. What shall I say I have\n"+
		"done? It must be a very plausive invention that\n"+
		"carries it: they begin to smoke me; and disgraces\n"+
		"have of late knocked too often at my door. I find\n"+
		"my tongue is too foolhardy; but my heart hath the\n"+
		"fear of Mars before it and of his creatures, not\n"+
		"daring the reports of my tongue.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"This is the first truth that e'er thine own tongue\n"+
		"was guilty of.\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"What the devil should move me to undertake the\n"+
		"recovery of this drum, being not ignorant of the\n"+
		"impossibility, and knowing I had no such purpose? I\n"+
		"must give myself some hurts, and say I got them in\n"+
		"exploit: yet slight ones will not carry it; they\n"+
		"will say, 'Came you off with so little?' and great\n"+
		"ones I dare not give. Wherefore, what's the\n"+
		"instance? Tongue, I must put you into a\n"+
		"butter-woman's mouth and buy myself another of\n"+
		"Bajazet's mule, if you prattle me into these perils.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"Is it possible he should know what he is, and be\n"+
		"that he is?\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"I would the cutting of my garments would serve the\n"+
		"turn, or the breaking of my Spanish sword.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"We cannot afford you so.\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"Or the baring of my beard; and to say it was in\n"+
		"stratagem.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"'Twould not do.\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"Or to drown my clothes, and say I was stripped.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"Hardly serve.\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"Though I swore I leaped from the window of the citadel.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"How deep?\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"Thirty fathom.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed.\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"I would I had any drum of the enemy's: I would swear\n"+
		"I recovered it.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"You shall hear one anon.\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"A drum now of the enemy's,--\n"+
		"Alarum within\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"Throca movousus, cargo, cargo, cargo.\n"+
		"All\n"+
		"Cargo, cargo, cargo, villiando par corbo, cargo.\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"O, ransom, ransom! do not hide mine eyes.\n"+
		"They seize and blindfold him\n"+
		"First Soldier\n"+
		"Boskos thromuldo boskos.\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"I know you are the Muskos' regiment:\n"+
		"And I shall lose my life for want of language;\n"+
		"If there be here German, or Dane, low Dutch,\n"+
		"Italian, or French, let him speak to me; I'll\n"+
		"Discover that which shall undo the Florentine.\n"+
		"First Soldier\n"+
		"Boskos vauvado: I understand thee, and can speak\n"+
		"thy tongue. Kerely bonto, sir, betake thee to thy\n"+
		"faith, for seventeen poniards are at thy bosom.\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"O!\n"+
		"First Soldier\n"+
		"O, pray, pray, pray! Manka revania dulche.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"Oscorbidulchos volivorco.\n"+
		"First Soldier\n"+
		"The general is content to spare thee yet;\n"+
		"And, hoodwink'd as thou art, will lead thee on\n"+
		"To gather from thee: haply thou mayst inform\n"+
		"Something to save thy life.\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"O, let me live!\n"+
		"And all the secrets of our camp I'll show,\n"+
		"Their force, their purposes; nay, I'll speak that\n"+
		"Which you will wonder at.\n"+
		"First Soldier\n"+
		"But wilt thou faithfully?\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"If I do not, damn me.\n"+
		"First Soldier\n"+
		"Acordo linta.\n"+
		"Come on; thou art granted space.\n"+
		"Exit, with PAROLLES guarded. A short alarum within\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"Go, tell the Count Rousillon, and my brother,\n"+
		"We have caught the woodcock, and will keep him muffled\n"+
		"Till we do hear from them.\n"+
		"Second Soldier\n"+
		"Captain, I will.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"A' will betray us all unto ourselves:\n"+
		"Inform on that.\n"+
		"Second Soldier\n"+
		"So I will, sir.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"Till then I'll keep him dark and safely lock'd.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE II. Florence. The Widow's house.\n"+
		"Enter BERTRAM and DIANA\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"They told me that your name was Fontibell.\n"+
		"DIANA\n"+
		"No, my good lord, Diana.\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"Titled goddess;\n"+
		"And worth it, with addition! But, fair soul,\n"+
		"In your fine frame hath love no quality?\n"+
		"If quick fire of youth light not your mind,\n"+
		"You are no maiden, but a monument:\n"+
		"When you are dead, you should be such a one\n"+
		"As you are now, for you are cold and stem;\n"+
		"And now you should be as your mother was\n"+
		"When your sweet self was got.\n"+
		"DIANA\n"+
		"She then was honest.\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"So should you be.\n"+
		"DIANA\n"+
		"No:\n"+
		"My mother did but duty; such, my lord,\n"+
		"As you owe to your wife.\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"No more o' that;\n"+
		"I prithee, do not strive against my vows:\n"+
		"I was compell'd to her; but I love thee\n"+
		"By love's own sweet constraint, and will for ever\n"+
		"Do thee all rights of service.\n"+
		"DIANA\n"+
		"Ay, so you serve us\n"+
		"Till we serve you; but when you have our roses,\n"+
		"You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves\n"+
		"And mock us with our bareness.\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"How have I sworn!\n"+
		"DIANA\n"+
		"'Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth,\n"+
		"But the plain single vow that is vow'd true.\n"+
		"What is not holy, that we swear not by,\n"+
		"But take the High'st to witness: then, pray you, tell me,\n"+
		"If I should swear by God's great attributes,\n"+
		"I loved you dearly, would you believe my oaths,\n"+
		"When I did love you ill? This has no holding,\n"+
		"To swear by him whom I protest to love,\n"+
		"That I will work against him: therefore your oaths\n"+
		"Are words and poor conditions, but unseal'd,\n"+
		"At least in my opinion.\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"Change it, change it;\n"+
		"Be not so holy-cruel: love is holy;\n"+
		"And my integrity ne'er knew the crafts\n"+
		"That you do charge men with. Stand no more off,\n"+
		"But give thyself unto my sick desires,\n"+
		"Who then recover: say thou art mine, and ever\n"+
		"My love as it begins shall so persever.\n"+
		"DIANA\n"+
		"I see that men make ropes in such a scarre\n"+
		"That we'll forsake ourselves. Give me that ring.\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"I'll lend it thee, my dear; but have no power\n"+
		"To give it from me.\n"+
		"DIANA\n"+
		"Will you not, my lord?\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"It is an honour 'longing to our house,\n"+
		"Bequeathed down from many ancestors;\n"+
		"Which were the greatest obloquy i' the world\n"+
		"In me to lose.\n"+
		"DIANA\n"+
		"Mine honour's such a ring:\n"+
		"My chastity's the jewel of our house,\n"+
		"Bequeathed down from many ancestors;\n"+
		"Which were the greatest obloquy i' the world\n"+
		"In me to lose: thus your own proper wisdom\n"+
		"Brings in the champion Honour on my part,\n"+
		"Against your vain assault.\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"Here, take my ring:\n"+
		"My house, mine honour, yea, my life, be thine,\n"+
		"And I'll be bid by thee.\n"+
		"DIANA\n"+
		"When midnight comes, knock at my chamber-window:\n"+
		"I'll order take my mother shall not hear.\n"+
		"Now will I charge you in the band of truth,\n"+
		"When you have conquer'd my yet maiden bed,\n"+
		"Remain there but an hour, nor speak to me:\n"+
		"My reasons are most strong; and you shall know them\n"+
		"When back again this ring shall be deliver'd:\n"+
		"And on your finger in the night I'll put\n"+
		"Another ring, that what in time proceeds\n"+
		"May token to the future our past deeds.\n"+
		"Adieu, till then; then, fail not. You have won\n"+
		"A wife of me, though there my hope be done.\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"A heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"DIANA\n"+
		"For which live long to thank both heaven and me!\n"+
		"You may so in the end.\n"+
		"My mother told me just how he would woo,\n"+
		"As if she sat in 's heart; she says all men\n"+
		"Have the like oaths: he had sworn to marry me\n"+
		"When his wife's dead; therefore I'll lie with him\n"+
		"When I am buried. Since Frenchmen are so braid,\n"+
		"Marry that will, I live and die a maid:\n"+
		"Only in this disguise I think't no sin\n"+
		"To cozen him that would unjustly win.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"SCENE III. The Florentine camp.\n"+
		"Enter the two French Lords and some two or three Soldiers\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"You have not given him his mother's letter?\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"I have delivered it an hour since: there is\n"+
		"something in't that stings his nature; for on the\n"+
		"reading it he changed almost into another man.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking\n"+
		"off so good a wife and so sweet a lady.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"Especially he hath incurred the everlasting\n"+
		"displeasure of the king, who had even tuned his\n"+
		"bounty to sing happiness to him. I will tell you a\n"+
		"thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly with you.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"When you have spoken it, 'tis dead, and I am the\n"+
		"grave of it.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in\n"+
		"Florence, of a most chaste renown; and this night he\n"+
		"fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour: he hath\n"+
		"given her his monumental ring, and thinks himself\n"+
		"made in the unchaste composition.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"Now, God delay our rebellion! as we are ourselves,\n"+
		"what things are we!\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"Merely our own traitors. And as in the common course\n"+
		"of all treasons, we still see them reveal\n"+
		"themselves, till they attain to their abhorred ends,\n"+
		"so he that in this action contrives against his own\n"+
		"nobility, in his proper stream o'erflows himself.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"Is it not meant damnable in us, to be trumpeters of\n"+
		"our unlawful intents? We shall not then have his\n"+
		"company to-night?\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"Not till after midnight; for he is dieted to his hour.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"That approaches apace; I would gladly have him see\n"+
		"his company anatomized, that he might take a measure\n"+
		"of his own judgments, wherein so curiously he had\n"+
		"set this counterfeit.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"We will not meddle with him till he come; for his\n"+
		"presence must be the whip of the other.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"In the mean time, what hear you of these wars?\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"I hear there is an overture of peace.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"Nay, I assure you, a peace concluded.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"What will Count Rousillon do then? will he travel\n"+
		"higher, or return again into France?\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"I perceive, by this demand, you are not altogether\n"+
		"of his council.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"Let it be forbid, sir; so should I be a great deal\n"+
		"of his act.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"Sir, his wife some two months since fled from his\n"+
		"house: her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques\n"+
		"le Grand; which holy undertaking with most austere\n"+
		"sanctimony she accomplished; and, there residing the\n"+
		"tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her\n"+
		"grief; in fine, made a groan of her last breath, and\n"+
		"now she sings in heaven.\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"How is this justified?\n"+

		"How now, my lord! is't not after midnight?\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"I have to-night dispatched sixteen businesses, a\n"+

		"poor gallant knave.\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"No matter: his heels have deserved it, in usurping\n"+

		"Second Lord\n"+
		"I have told your lordship already, the stocks carry\n"+
		"him. But to answer you as you would be understood;\n"+
		"he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk: he\n"+
		"hath confessed himself to Morgan, whom he supposes\n"+
		"to be a friar, from the time of his remembrance to\n"+
		"this very instant disaster of his setting i' the\n"+
		"stocks: and what think you he hath confessed?\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"Nothing of me, has a'?\n"+
		"Second Lord\n"+
		"His confession is taken, and it shall be read to his\n"+
		"face: if your lordship be in't, as I believe you\n"+

		"First Lord\n"+
		"You're deceived, my lord: this is Monsieur\n"+

		"Well, that's set down.\n"+

		"hundred and fifty; Sebastian, so many; Corambus, so\n"+

		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"What shall be done to him?\n"+

		"Diana, to take heed of the allurement of one Count\n"+
		"Rousillon, a foolish idle boy, but for all that very\n"+

		"Nay, I'll read it first, by your favour.\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"My meaning in't, I protest, was very honest in the\n"+

		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"He will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister: for\n"+
		"rapes and ravishments he parallels Nessus: he\n"+
		"professes not keeping of oaths; in breaking 'em he\n"+
		"is stronger than Hercules: he will lie, sir, with\n"+
		"such volubility, that you would think truth were a\n"+
		"fool: drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will\n"+
		"be swine-drunk; and in his sleep he does little\n"+
		"harm, save to his bed-clothes about him; but they\n"+
		"know his conditions and lay him in straw. I have but\n"+
		"little more to say, sir, of his honesty: he has\n"+

		"an honest man should have, he has nothing.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"I begin to love him for this.\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"For this description of thine honesty? A pox upon\n"+
		"him for me, he's more and more a cat.\n"+
		"First Soldier\n"+
		"What say you to his expertness in war?\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"Faith, sir, he has led the drum before the English\n"+
		"tragedians; to belie him, I will not, and more of\n"+
		"his soldiership I know not; except, in that country\n"+
		"he had the honour to be the officer at a place there\n"+
		"called Mile-end, to instruct for the doubling of\n"+
		"files: I would do the man what honour I can, but of\n"+
		"this I am not certain.\n"+
		"First Lord\n"+
		"He hath out-villained villany so far, that the\n"+

		"His qualities being at this poor price, I need not\n"+
		"to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt.\n"+

		"Second Lord\n"+
		"Why does be ask him of me?\n"+
		"First Soldier\n"+
		"What's he?\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"E'en a crow o' the same nest; not altogether so\n"+
		"great as the first in goodness, but greater a great\n"+

		"First Soldier\n"+
		"There is no remedy, sir, but you must die: the\n"+

		"First Soldier\n"+
		"If you could find out a country where but women were\n"+

		"Yet am I thankful: if my heart were great,\n"+
		"'Twould burst at this. Captain I'll be no more;\n"+
		"But I will eat and drink, and sleep as soft\n"+
		"As captain shall: simply the thing I am\n"+

		"HELENA\n"+
		"That you may well perceive I have not wrong'd you,\n"+
		"One of the greatest in the Christian world\n"+

		"That can such sweet use make of what they hate,\n"+
		"When saucy trusting of the cozen'd thoughts\n"+
		"Defiles the pitchy night: so lust doth play\n"+
		"With what it loathes for that which is away.\n"+
		"But more of this hereafter. You, Diana,\n"+

		"All's well that ends well; still the fine's the crown;\n"+
		"Whate'er the course, the end is the renown.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"+
		"SCENE V. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.\n"+
		"Enter COUNTESS, LAFEU, and Clown\n"+
		"LAFEU\n"+
		"No, no, no, your son was misled with a snipt-taffeta\n"+
		"fellow there, whose villanous saffron would have\n"+
		"made all the unbaked and doughy youth of a nation in\n"+
		"his colour: your daughter-in-law had been alive at\n"+
		"this hour, and your son here at home, more advanced\n"+
		"by the king than by that red-tailed humble-bee I speak of.\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"I would I had not known him; it was the death of the\n"+
		"most virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had\n"+
		"praise for creating. If she had partaken of my\n"+
		"flesh, and cost me the dearest groans of a mother, I\n"+
		"could not have owed her a more rooted love.\n"+
		"LAFEU\n"+
		"'Twas a good lady, 'twas a good lady: we may pick a\n"+
		"thousand salads ere we light on such another herb.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Indeed, sir, she was the sweet marjoram of the\n"+
		"salad, or rather, the herb of grace.\n"+
		"LAFEU\n"+
		"They are not herbs, you knave; they are nose-herbs.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"I am no great Nebuchadnezzar, sir; I have not much\n"+
		"skill in grass.\n"+
		"LAFEU\n"+
		"Whether dost thou profess thyself, a knave or a fool?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"A fool, sir, at a woman's service, and a knave at a man's.\n"+
		"LAFEU\n"+
		"Your distinction?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"I would cozen the man of his wife and do his service.\n"+
		"LAFEU\n"+
		"So you were a knave at his service, indeed.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"And I would give his wife my bauble, sir, to do her service.\n"+
		"LAFEU\n"+
		"I will subscribe for thee, thou art both knave and fool.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"At your service.\n"+
		"LAFEU\n"+
		"No, no, no.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Why, sir, if I cannot serve you, I can serve as\n"+
		"great a prince as you are.\n"+
		"LAFEU\n"+
		"Who's that? a Frenchman?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Faith, sir, a' has an English name; but his fisnomy\n"+
		"is more hotter in France than there.\n"+
		"LAFEU\n"+
		"What prince is that?\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"The black prince, sir; alias, the prince of\n"+
		"darkness; alias, the devil.\n"+
		"LAFEU\n"+
		"Hold thee, there's my purse: I give thee not this\n"+
		"to suggest thee from thy master thou talkest of;\n"+
		"serve him still.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"I am a woodland fellow, sir, that always loved a\n"+
		"great fire; and the master I speak of ever keeps a\n"+
		"good fire. But, sure, he is the prince of the\n"+
		"world; let his nobility remain in's court. I am for\n"+
		"the house with the narrow gate, which I take to be\n"+
		"too little for pomp to enter: some that humble\n"+
		"themselves may; but the many will be too chill and\n"+
		"tender, and they'll be for the flowery way that\n"+
		"leads to the broad gate and the great fire.\n"+
		"LAFEU\n"+
		"Go thy ways, I begin to be aweary of thee; and I\n"+
		"tell thee so before, because I would not fall out\n"+
		"with thee. Go thy ways: let my horses be well\n"+
		"looked to, without any tricks.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"If I put any tricks upon 'em, sir, they shall be\n"+
		"jades' tricks; which are their own right by the law of nature.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"LAFEU\n"+
		"A shrewd knave and an unhappy.\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"So he is. My lord that's gone made himself much\n"+
		"sport out of him: by his authority he remains here,\n"+
		"which he thinks is a patent for his sauciness; and,\n"+
		"indeed, he has no pace, but runs where he will.\n"+
		"LAFEU\n"+
		"I like him well; 'tis not amiss. And I was about to\n"+
		"tell you, since I heard of the good lady's death and\n"+
		"that my lord your son was upon his return home, I\n"+
		"moved the king my master to speak in the behalf of\n"+
		"my daughter; which, in the minority of them both,\n"+
		"his majesty, out of a self-gracious remembrance, did\n"+
		"first propose: his highness hath promised me to do\n"+
		"it: and, to stop up the displeasure he hath\n"+
		"conceived against your son, there is no fitter\n"+
		"matter. How does your ladyship like it?\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"With very much content, my lord; and I wish it\n"+
		"happily effected.\n"+
		"LAFEU\n"+
		"His highness comes post from Marseilles, of as able\n"+
		"body as when he numbered thirty: he will be here\n"+
		"to-morrow, or I am deceived by him that in such\n"+
		"intelligence hath seldom failed.\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"It rejoices me, that I hope I shall see him ere I\n"+
		"die. I have letters that my son will be here\n"+
		"to-night: I shall beseech your lordship to remain\n"+

		"Clown\n"+
		"O madam, yonder's my lord your son with a patch of\n"+

		"or no, the velvet knows; but 'tis a goodly patch of\n"+
		"velvet: his left cheek is a cheek of two pile and a\n"+

		"LAFEU\n"+
		"A scar nobly got, or a noble scar, is a good livery\n"+
		"of honour; so belike is that.\n"+

		"Gentleman\n"+
		"What's your will?\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"That it will please you\n"+

		"Enter Clown, and PAROLLES, following\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"Good Monsieur Lavache, give my Lord Lafeu this\n"+
		"letter: I have ere now, sir, been better known to\n"+
		"you, when I have held familiarity with fresher\n"+
		"clothes; but I am now, sir, muddied in fortune's\n"+
		"mood, and smell somewhat strong of her strong\n"+
		"displeasure.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Truly, fortune's displeasure is but sluttish, if it\n"+
		"smell so strongly as thou speakest of: I will\n"+
		"henceforth eat no fish of fortune's buttering.\n"+
		"Prithee, allow the wind.\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"Nay, you need not to stop your nose, sir; I spake\n"+
		"but by a metaphor.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Indeed, sir, if your metaphor stink, I will stop my\n"+
		"nose; or against any man's metaphor. Prithee, get\n"+
		"thee further.\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"Pray you, sir, deliver me this paper.\n"+
		"Clown\n"+
		"Foh! prithee, stand away: a paper from fortune's\n"+
		"close-stool to give to a nobleman! Look, here he\n"+
		"comes himself.\n"+
		"Enter LAFEU\n"+
		"Here is a purr of fortune's, sir, or of fortune's\n"+
		"cat,--but not a musk-cat,--that has fallen into the\n"+
		"unclean fishpond of her displeasure, and, as he\n"+
		"says, is muddied withal: pray you, sir, use the\n"+
		"carp as you may; for he looks like a poor, decayed,\n"+
		"ingenious, foolish, rascally knave. I do pity his\n"+
		"distress in my similes of comfort and leave him to\n"+
		"your lordship.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"My lord, I am a man whom fortune hath cruelly\n"+
		"scratched.\n"+
		"LAFEU\n"+
		"And what would you have me to do? 'Tis too late to\n"+
		"pare her nails now. Wherein have you played the\n"+
		"knave with fortune, that she should scratch you, who\n"+
		"of herself is a good lady and would not have knaves\n"+
		"thrive long under her? There's a quart d'ecu for\n"+
		"you: let the justices make you and fortune friends:\n"+
		"I am for other business.\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"I beseech your honour to hear me one single word.\n"+

		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"My name, my good lord, is Parolles.\n"+
		"LAFEU\n"+
		"You beg more than 'word,' then. Cox my passion!\n"+

		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"O my good lord, you were the first that found me!\n"+
		"LAFEU\n"+
		"Was I, in sooth? and I was the first that lost thee.\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"It lies in you, my lord, to bring me in some grace,\n"+
		"for you did bring me out.\n"+
		"LAFEU\n"+
		"Out upon thee, knave! dost thou put upon me at once\n"+
		"both the office of God and the devil? One brings\n"+
		"thee in grace and the other brings thee out.\n"+
		"Trumpets sound\n"+
		"The king's coming; I know by his trumpets. Sirrah,\n"+

		"Flourish. Enter KING, COUNTESS, LAFEU, the two French Lords, with Attendants\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"We lost a jewel of her; and our esteem\n"+
		"Was made much poorer by it: but your son,\n"+

		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"'Tis past, my liege;\n"+

		"KING\n"+
		"My honour'd lady,\n"+
		"I have forgiven and forgotten all;\n"+
		"Though my revenges were high bent upon him,\n"+
		"And watch'd the time to shoot.\n"+
		"LAFEU\n"+
		"This I must say,\n"+
		"But first I beg my pardon, the young lord\n"+
		"Did to his majesty, his mother and his lady\n"+
		"Offence of mighty note; but to himself\n"+
		"The greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife\n"+
		"Whose beauty did astonish the survey\n"+
		"Of richest eyes, whose words all ears took captive,\n"+
		"Whose dear perfection hearts that scorn'd to serve\n"+
		"Humbly call'd mistress.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"Praising what is lost\n"+
		"Makes the remembrance dear. Well, call him hither;\n"+
		"We are reconciled, and the first view shall kill\n"+
		"All repetition: let him not ask our pardon;\n"+
		"The nature of his great offence is dead,\n"+
		"And deeper than oblivion we do bury\n"+
		"The incensing relics of it: let him approach,\n"+
		"A stranger, no offender; and inform him\n"+
		"So 'tis our will he should.\n"+
		"Gentleman\n"+
		"I shall, my liege.\n"+
		"Exit\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"What says he to your daughter? have you spoke?\n"+
		"LAFEU\n"+
		"All that he is hath reference to your highness.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"Then shall we have a match. I have letters sent me\n"+
		"That set him high in fame.\n"+
		"Enter BERTRAM\n"+
		"LAFEU\n"+
		"He looks well on't.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"I am not a day of season,\n"+
		"For thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail\n"+
		"In me at once: but to the brightest beams\n"+
		"Distracted clouds give way; so stand thou forth;\n"+
		"The time is fair again.\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"My high-repented blames,\n"+
		"Dear sovereign, pardon to me.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"All is whole;\n"+
		"Not one word more of the consumed time.\n"+
		"Let's take the instant by the forward top;\n"+
		"For we are old, and on our quick'st decrees\n"+
		"The inaudible and noiseless foot of Time\n"+
		"Steals ere we can effect them. You remember\n"+
		"The daughter of this lord?\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"Admiringly, my liege, at first\n"+
		"I stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart\n"+
		"Durst make too bold a herald of my tongue\n"+
		"Where the impression of mine eye infixing,\n"+
		"Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me,\n"+
		"Which warp'd the line of every other favour;\n"+
		"Scorn'd a fair colour, or express'd it stolen;\n"+
		"Extended or contracted all proportions\n"+
		"To a most hideous object: thence it came\n"+
		"That she whom all men praised and whom myself,\n"+
		"Since I have lost, have loved, was in mine eye\n"+
		"The dust that did offend it.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"Well excused:\n"+
		"That thou didst love her, strikes some scores away\n"+
		"From the great compt: but love that comes too late,\n"+
		"Like a remorseful pardon slowly carried,\n"+
		"To the great sender turns a sour offence,\n"+
		"Crying, 'That's good that's gone.' Our rash faults\n"+
		"Make trivial price of serious things we have,\n"+
		"Not knowing them until we know their grave:\n"+
		"Oft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust,\n"+
		"Destroy our friends and after weep their dust\n"+
		"Our own love waking cries to see what's done,\n"+
		"While shame full late sleeps out the afternoon.\n"+
		"Be this sweet Helen's knell, and now forget her.\n"+
		"Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin:\n"+
		"The main consents are had; and here we'll stay\n"+

		"Come on, my son, in whom my house's name\n"+
		"Must be digested, give a favour from you\n"+
		"To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter,\n"+
		"That she may quickly come.\n"+
		"BERTRAM gives a ring\n"+
		"By my old beard,\n"+
		"And every hair that's on't, Helen, that's dead,\n"+
		"Was a sweet creature: such a ring as this,\n"+
		"The last that e'er I took her at court,\n"+
		"I saw upon her finger.\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"Hers it was not.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"Now, pray you, let me see it; for mine eye,\n"+
		"While I was speaking, oft was fasten'd to't.\n"+
		"This ring was mine; and, when I gave it Helen,\n"+
		"I bade her, if her fortunes ever stood\n"+
		"Necessitied to help, that by this token\n"+
		"I would relieve her. Had you that craft, to reave\n"+
		"her\n"+
		"Of what should stead her most?\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"My gracious sovereign,\n"+
		"Howe'er it pleases you to take it so,\n"+
		"The ring was never hers.\n"+
		"COUNTESS\n"+
		"Son, on my life,\n"+
		"I have seen her wear it; and she reckon'd it\n"+
		"At her life's rate.\n"+
		"LAFEU\n"+
		"I am sure I saw her wear it.\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"You are deceived, my lord; she never saw it:\n"+
		"In Florence was it from a casement thrown me,\n"+
		"Wrapp'd in a paper, which contain'd the name\n"+
		"Of her that threw it: noble she was, and thought\n"+
		"I stood engaged: but when I had subscribed\n"+
		"To mine own fortune and inform'd her fully\n"+
		"I could not answer in that course of honour\n"+
		"As she had made the overture, she ceased\n"+
		"In heavy satisfaction and would never\n"+
		"Receive the ring again.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"Plutus himself,\n"+
		"That knows the tinct and multiplying medicine,\n"+
		"Hath not in nature's mystery more science\n"+
		"Than I have in this ring: 'twas mine, 'twas Helen's,\n"+
		"Whoever gave it you. Then, if you know\n"+
		"That you are well acquainted with yourself,\n"+
		"Confess 'twas hers, and by what rough enforcement\n"+
		"You got it from her: she call'd the saints to surety\n"+
		"That she would never put it from her finger,\n"+
		"Unless she gave it to yourself in bed,\n"+
		"Where you have never come, or sent it us\n"+
		"Upon her great disaster.\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"She never saw it.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"Thou speak'st it falsely, as I love mine honour;\n"+
		"And makest conjectural fears to come into me\n"+
		"Which I would fain shut out. If it should prove\n"+
		"That thou art so inhuman,--'twill not prove so;--\n"+
		"And yet I know not: thou didst hate her deadly,\n"+
		"And she is dead; which nothing, but to close\n"+
		"Her eyes myself, could win me to believe,\n"+
		"More than to see this ring. Take him away.\n"+
		"Guards seize BERTRAM\n"+
		"My fore-past proofs, howe'er the matter fall,\n"+
		"Shall tax my fears of little vanity,\n"+
		"Having vainly fear'd too little. Away with him!\n"+
		"We'll sift this matter further.\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"If you shall prove\n"+
		"This ring was ever hers, you shall as easy\n"+
		"Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence,\n"+
		"Where yet she never was.\n"+
		"Exit, guarded\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"I am wrapp'd in dismal thinkings.\n"+
		"Enter a Gentleman\n"+
		"Gentleman\n"+
		"Gracious sovereign,\n"+
		"Whether I have been to blame or no, I know not:\n"+
		"Here's a petition from a Florentine,\n"+
		"Who hath for four or five removes come short\n"+
		"To tender it herself. I undertook it,\n"+
		"Vanquish'd thereto by the fair grace and speech\n"+
		"Of the poor suppliant, who by this I know\n"+
		"Is here attending: her business looks in her\n"+
		"With an importing visage; and she told me,\n"+

		"Your highness with herself.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"[Reads] Upon his many protestations to marry me\n"+
		"when his wife was dead, I blush to say it, he won\n"+

		"What woman's that?\n"+
		"DIANA\n"+
		"I am, my lord, a wretched Florentine,\n"+
		"Derived from the ancient Capilet:\n"+
		"My suit, as I do understand, you know,\n"+
		"And therefore know how far I may be pitied.\n"+
		"Widow\n"+
		"I am her mother, sir, whose age and honour\n"+

		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"My lord, I neither can nor will deny\n"+
		"But that I know them: do they charge me further?\n"+

		"What of him?\n"+

		"KING\n"+
		"She hath that ring of yours.\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"I think she has: certain it is I liked her,\n"+
		"And boarded her i' the wanton way of youth:\n"+

		"Madding my eagerness with her restraint,\n"+
		"As all impediments in fancy's course\n"+
		"Are motives of more fancy; and, in fine,\n"+
		"Her infinite cunning, with her modern grace,\n"+
		"Subdued me to her rate: she got the ring;\n"+
		"And I had that which any inferior might\n"+
		"At market-price have bought.\n"+
		"DIANA\n"+
		"I must be patient:\n"+
		"You, that have turn'd off a first so noble wife,\n"+
		"May justly diet me. I pray you yet;\n"+
		"Since you lack virtue, I will lose a husband;\n"+
		"Send for your ring, I will return it home,\n"+

		"KING\n"+
		"The story then goes false, you threw it him\n"+
		"Out of a casement.\n"+
		"DIANA\n"+
		"I have spoke the truth.\n"+

		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"My lord, I do confess the ring was hers.\n"+
		"KING\n"+

		"DIANA\n"+
		"Ay, my lord.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"Tell me, sirrah, but tell me true, I charge you,\n"+
		"Not fearing the displeasure of your master,\n"+

		"By him and by this woman here what know you?\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"So please your majesty, my master hath been an\n"+

		"Faith, sir, he did love her; but how?\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"How, I pray you?\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"He did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"How is that?\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"He loved her, sir, and loved her not.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"As thou art a knave, and no knave. What an\n"+
		"equivocal companion is this!\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"I am a poor man, and at your majesty's command.\n"+
		"LAFEU\n"+
		"He's a good drum, my lord, but a naughty orator.\n"+
		"DIANA\n"+
		"Do you know he promised me marriage?\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"Faith, I know more than I'll speak.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"But wilt thou not speak all thou knowest?\n"+
		"PAROLLES\n"+
		"Yes, so please your majesty. I did go between them,\n"+
		"as I said; but more than that, he loved her: for\n"+
		"indeed he was mad for her, and talked of Satan and\n"+
		"of Limbo and of Furies and I know not what: yet I\n"+
		"was in that credit with them at that time that I\n"+
		"knew of their going to bed, and of other motions,\n"+
		"as promising her marriage, and things which would\n"+
		"derive me ill will to speak of; therefore I will not\n"+
		"speak what I know.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"Thou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst say\n"+
		"they are married: but thou art too fine in thy\n"+
		"evidence; therefore stand aside.\n"+
		"This ring, you say, was yours?\n"+

		"Where did you buy it? or who gave it you?\n"+

		"It was not given me, nor I did not buy it.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"Who lent it you?\n"+
		"DIANA\n"+
		"It was not lent me neither.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"Where did you find it, then?\n"+
		"DIANA\n"+
		"I found it not.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"If it were yours by none of all these ways,\n"+
		"How could you give it him?\n"+
		"DIANA\n"+
		"I never gave it him.\n"+
		"LAFEU\n"+
		"This woman's an easy glove, my lord; she goes off\n"+
		"and on at pleasure.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"This ring was mine; I gave it his first wife.\n"+
		"DIANA\n"+
		"It might be yours or hers, for aught I know.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"Take her away; I do not like her now;\n"+
		"To prison with her: and away with him.\n"+
		"Unless thou tell'st me where thou hadst this ring,\n"+
		"Thou diest within this hour.\n"+
		"DIANA\n"+
		"I'll never tell you.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"Take her away.\n"+
		"DIANA\n"+
		"I'll put in bail, my liege.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"I think thee now some common customer.\n"+
		"DIANA\n"+
		"By Jove, if ever I knew man, 'twas you.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"Wherefore hast thou accused him all this while?\n"+
		"DIANA\n"+
		"Because he's guilty, and he is not guilty:\n"+
		"He knows I am no maid, and he'll swear to't;\n"+
		"I'll swear I am a maid, and he knows not.\n"+
		"Great king, I am no strumpet, by my life;\n"+
		"I am either maid, or else this old man's wife.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"She does abuse our ears: to prison with her.\n"+
		"DIANA\n"+
		"Good mother, fetch my bail. Stay, royal sir:\n"+
		"Exit Widow\n"+
		"The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for,\n"+
		"And he shall surety me. But for this lord,\n"+
		"Who hath abused me, as he knows himself,\n"+
		"Though yet he never harm'd me, here I quit him:\n"+
		"He knows himself my bed he hath defiled;\n"+
		"And at that time he got his wife with child:\n"+
		"Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick:\n"+
		"So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick:\n"+
		"And now behold the meaning.\n"+
		"Re-enter Widow, with HELENA\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"Is there no exorcist\n"+
		"Beguiles the truer office of mine eyes?\n"+
		"Is't real that I see?\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"No, my good lord;\n"+
		"'Tis but the shadow of a wife you see,\n"+
		"The name and not the thing.\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"Both, both. O, pardon!\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"O my good lord, when I was like this maid,\n"+
		"I found you wondrous kind. There is your ring;\n"+
		"And, look you, here's your letter; this it says:\n"+
		"'When from my finger you can get this ring\n"+
		"And are by me with child,' & c. This is done:\n"+
		"Will you be mine, now you are doubly won?\n"+
		"BERTRAM\n"+
		"If she, my liege, can make me know this clearly,\n"+
		"I'll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly.\n"+
		"HELENA\n"+
		"If it appear not plain and prove untrue,\n"+
		"Deadly divorce step between me and you!\n"+
		"O my dear mother, do I see you living?\n"+
		"LAFEU\n"+
		"Mine eyes smell onions; I shall weep anon:\n"+
		"To PAROLLES\n"+
		"Good Tom Drum, lend me a handkercher: so,\n"+
		"I thank thee: wait on me home, I'll make sport with thee:\n"+
		"Let thy courtesies alone, they are scurvy ones.\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"Let us from point to point this story know,\n"+
		"To make the even truth in pleasure flow.\n"+
		"To DIANA\n"+
		"If thou be'st yet a fresh uncropped flower,\n"+
		"Choose thou thy husband, and I'll pay thy dower;\n"+
		"For I can guess that by thy honest aid\n"+
		"Thou keep'st a wife herself, thyself a maid.\n"+
		"Of that and all the progress, more or less,\n"+
		"Resolvedly more leisure shall express:\n"+
		"All yet seems well; and if it end so meet,\n"+
		"The bitter past, more welcome is the sweet.\n"+
		"Flourish\n"+
		"EPILOGUE\n"+
		"KING\n"+
		"The king's a beggar, now the play is done:\n"+
		"All is well ended, if this suit be won,\n"+
		"That you express content; which we will pay,\n"+
		"With strife to please you, day exceeding day:\n"+
		"Ours be your patience then, and yours our parts;\n"+
		"Your gentle hands lend us, and take our hearts.\n"+
		"Exeunt\n"
